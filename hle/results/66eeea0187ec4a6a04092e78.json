  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is to find the minimum number of swaps needed to move the '1' to the center of a 5x5 matrix. The allowed moves are swapping adjacent rows or columns. Oh right, each swap of adjacent rows or columns counts as one move. My goal is to compute how many such swaps are needed in total to bring the 1 to position (3,3), which is the center.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the 1 is located in the matrix. Once I have its current position, I can calculate how many row swaps and column swaps are needed to get it to the center.\n\nSo the steps I should take are:\n\n1. Read the 5x5 matrix.\n2. Find the position (i,j) of the 1.\n3. Determine how many row moves are needed to get from row i to row 3. Since each adjacent swap moves the row by one, the number of moves is the absolute difference (i-3). For example, if the row is 1, then need 2 swaps (row 1 to 2, then 2 to 3).\n4. Similarly for columns, the number of column swaps needed is absolute (j-3).\n5. Sum these two values to get the total minimum moves.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because moving a row up or down by adjacent swaps takes |target_row - current_row| steps. Same for columns.\n\nSo for example, if the 1 is at (1,1), then row moves: 2 (from row 1 to 3), column moves: 2 (from column 1 to 3). Total 4 moves. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: if the 1 is already at (3,3), then 0 moves. If it's at (3,5), then column moves are 2 (since 5-3=2, but wait j is 5. So 5-3=2? Yes, 5 is two steps away from 3. So 5\u21924 (1 move), 4\u21923 (another move). Total 2. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the solution is straightforward. Just find the coordinates of the 1 and sum the absolute differences from row 3 and column 3.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nThe code steps would be:\n\n- Read 5 lines, each with 5 numbers.\n- Iterate through each row and column to find where the 1 is.\n- Once found, calculate the row moves as abs(i - 2), because rows are 0-indexed? Wait, wait. The problem statement says rows are indexed 1-5 from top to bottom. So row 1 is the first row. So in code, if we read into a list, the first element is row 1, second row 2, etc. So for a zero-based index in code, the row index in the problem is i+1. For example, code's row 0 is problem's row 1. So when the code reads the input into a list of lists, each row is problem's row 1 to 5.\n\nBut when processing, in code, the current row index (in code) is from 0 to 4. So the problem's rows are 1-5, code's rows are 0-4. So to find the problem's row index, code's index is (code_row + 1). Wait no, the problem says the input's i-th line is the i-th row. So for example, the first line of input corresponds to row 1. So in code, the first row (index 0 in Python) is row 1, the third row (index 2) is row 3 (the center). So when we find the 1's position in code as (i, j), the problem's row is i+1. Wait no. Wait, in code, we have rows as 0-based. So code's row index for the first input line is 0, which represents problem's row 1. So the code's row index is (problem's row -1). So if the problem's row is 3, code's index is 2.\n\nSo when the code finds the position (i, j), where i is 0-based for rows, and j is 0-based for columns (since each line's entries are stored as a list, j is 0-based in code but problem's column is j+1). So the problem's row number is i+1, and column is j+1. \n\nSo to compute the required moves:\n\nrow_moves = abs( (i+1) - 3 ) \u2192 because the problem's row for the center is 3.\n\nSimilarly column_moves = abs( (j+1) -3 )\n\nWait, no. Because the center is (3,3) in the problem's indices, which in code's indices is (2,2). So if in code, the 1 is at (i,j) (code's 0-based), then the problem's row is i+1, and the target row is 3. So the difference is ( (i+1) -3 ). The absolute value of that difference gives the number of row swaps needed.\n\nSame for columns: ( (j+1) -3 ). Absolute value.\n\nWait, for example, code's (i,j) is (0,0). Problem's row is 1, column 1. So row difference is 1-3= -2 \u2192 absolute 2. Column difference 1-3= -2 \u2192 absolute 2. Total 4 moves. Correct.\n\nAnother example: code's (2,2) is problem's (3,3) \u2192 0 moves.\n\nSo yes, the formula is correct. So the code needs to find the (i,j) in the code's 0-based indices where matrix[i][j] == 1, then compute the row and column moves as abs((i+1) -3) + abs((j+1)-3). Oh wait, because each move swaps adjacent rows. So moving a row from 1 to 3 requires two swaps. So yes, the formula works.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead 5 lines. For each line, split into integers. Then loop through each element to find where the 1 is.\n\nOnce found, compute the distance.\n\nSo in Python, code could look like:\n\nmatrix = []\nfor _ in range(5):\n    row = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    matrix.append(row)\n\n# find the position of 1\nfor i in range(5):\n    for j in range(5):\n        if matrix[i][j] == 1:\n            row, col = i, j\n            break\n    else:\n        continue\n    break\n\nmoves = abs(row - 2) + abs(col - 2)\nprint(moves)\n\nWait wait! Because in code's indices, the center is at (2,2). So the problem's (3,3) corresponds to code's (2,2). So the required position is code's (2,2). So the number of row moves is current code's i (row) to 2, and same for column. Because each swap moves the row by 1. So code's row index is 0-4. To reach 2, the current i's difference from 2 is the number of moves. So for example, if the code's row is 0, moves are 2 (0\u21921, 1\u21922). So the code is correct as (row - 2) \u2192 no, wait. Wait, the code is (i - 2) in row? Because code's row index 0: 0-2 \u2192 -2, absolute 2. Correct.\n\nWait, code's i is the code's row index. The target row in code's index is 2. So the number of swaps is |i - 2|. Similarly for columns. So yes. So the code should compute moves as abs(i - 2) + abs(j - 2).\n\nWait, earlier calculation was (i+1) -3 \u2192 that's i+1-3 = i-2. So yes. So the code's current row is i. So (i+1) is the problem's row. The difference between that and 3 is (i+1 -3) = i-2. The absolute value gives the number of row swaps. Which is the same as abs(i -2). So yes, the code is correct.\n\nSo that's the correct approach. So the code reads the matrix, finds the 1's position in code's 0-based indices, calculates the sum of the row and column distances from (2,2).\n\nSo the program is straightforward.\n\nNow, testing some examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nThen code's (i,j) is (2,1). So moves are abs(2-2) (0) for row, abs(1-2) (1) for column. Total 1. So correct. But wait, the problem's original matrix here has the 1 at row 3 (problem's i=3) column 2 (problem's j=2). So code's i is 2 (third row) and j is 1 (second column). So to reach (2,2) in code's index (center), needs one column swap. So code returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 1 is in (1,1) in code's 0-based. So code's i=0, j=0. moves = (0-2) \u2192 2, (0-2) \u2192 2. Sum 4. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The problem requires finding the minimum number of adjacent row or column swaps to move the '1' to the center (3rd row and 3rd column, which is index (2,2) in 0-based).
