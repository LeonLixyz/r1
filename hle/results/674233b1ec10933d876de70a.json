  "question": "Let $n$ be an integer with $n \\geq 2$. Over all real polynomials $p(x)$ of degree $n$, what is the largest possible number of negative coefficients of $p(x)^2$?\n\n",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so the problem is about finding the largest possible number of negative coefficients in the square of a real polynomial of degree n (where n is at least 2). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when you square a polynomial, the coefficients of the resulting polynomial are determined by the convolution of the coefficients of the original polynomial. So, if p(x) is a polynomial with coefficients a_0, a_1, ..., a_n, then p(x)^2 will have coefficients where each coefficient c_k is the sum of a_i * a_{k-i} for i from 0 to k. \n\nBut the question is about the number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2. We need to maximize that number. So, we need to arrange the coefficients of p(x) such that when we square it, as many coefficients as possible in the product are negative. \n\nWait a minute, but squares of real numbers are non-negative. However, when you multiply terms in the polynomial, cross terms can be negative. For example, if you have p(x) with both positive and negative coefficients, the products of different terms could lead to negative coefficients in p(x)^2. \n\nBut how do we maximize that? Let me consider some examples. Maybe small n first to get a pattern.\n\nTake n=2. Let p(x) = a + bx + cx^2. Then p(x)^2 = a^2 + 2abx + (2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2bc x^3 + c^2 x^4. All coefficients except perhaps the cross terms. Wait, but coefficients here: the coefficients of x^0 is a^2 (positive), x^1 is 2ab (could be negative if a and b have opposite signs), x^2 is 2ac + b^2. Hmm, the x^2 term: suppose a is positive and c is negative, then 2ac would be negative, but b^2 is positive. So maybe if 2ac is negative enough, but since a is squared, maybe not. Wait, but if a is positive, then c could be negative. Let me try numbers. Let p(x) = 1 - x - x^2. Then p(x)^2 = (1 - x -x^2)^2. Let's compute:\n\n(1)^2 =1. Then cross terms: 2*(1*(-x)) = -2x. 2*(1*(-x^2))= -2x^2. Then (-x)^2 =x^2, 2*(-x)*(-x^2)=2x^3. (-x^2)^2 =x^4. So combining all terms:\n\n1 -2x -2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4. So coefficients are 1, -2, -2, 2, 1. So two negative coefficients. But can we get more?\n\nWait, maybe if we have p(x) = 1 + x - x^2. Then p(x)^2 would be 1 + 2x + (2*(-1) +1) x^2 + 2*(-1)x^3 + x^4. So 1 +2x -1x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. Coefficients: 1,2,-1,-2,1. So two negative coefficients here as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, what if p(x) is 1 - x + x^2. Then p(x)^2 is 1 -2x +3x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. Coefficients: 1,-2,3,-2,1. So two negative coefficients again.\n\nWait, is it possible to get three negative coefficients for n=2? Let's see. Suppose p(x) has more terms. Wait, the original p(x) is degree 2, so three coefficients. Let's choose coefficients such that when we square, multiple cross terms lead to negatives.\n\nSuppose p(x) = a + bx + cx^2, and we want as many coefficients in p(x)^2 to be negative. Let's try:\n\nSuppose a is positive, b is negative, c is positive. Then:\n\nc_0 = a^2 (positive)\nc_1 = 2ab (negative since a positive, b negative)\nc_2 = 2ac + b^2 (positive, because 2ac is positive if a and c are positive, and b^2 is positive)\nc_3 = 2bc (negative if b is negative and c positive)\nc_4 = c^2 (positive)\n\nSo in this case, coefficients at x^1 and x^3 would be negative. So two negative coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, if c is negative. Let's try a=1, b=1, c=-1. Then p(x) =1 +x -x^2. Then p(x)^2:\n\n1 +2x + ( -2 +1 )x^2 + (-2)x^3 + x^4. So coefficients 1,2,-1,-2,1. Two negative coefficients. \n\nWait, another case: a negative, b positive, c positive. Let p(x) = -1 +x +x^2. Then p(x)^2 =1 -2x -x^2 +2x^3 +x^4. Coefficients:1, -2, -1, 2,1. Here, two negative coefficients again. \n\nHmm. So for n=2, the maximum number of negative coefficients seems to be 2. But maybe 3?\n\nWait, is there a way? Let's see. Suppose p(x) is 1 -x -x^2. Then p(x)^2 is 1 -2x -2x^2 + 2x^3 +x^4. So coefficients 1, -2, -2, 2,1. Here, two negative coefficients (at x and x^2). So that's two. If we can find a p(x) where three coefficients are negative. Let's see. Suppose p(x) =1 +x -x^2. Then coefficients in p(x)^2:1, 2, ( -2 +1)= -1, -2, 1. So coefficients 1,2,-1,-2,1. So two negative coefficients. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we have higher coefficients canceling terms? Not sure. Maybe not possible. So for n=2, maximum is two. But wait, the polynomial p(x)^2 is of degree 4, so five coefficients. The maximum number of negative coefficients is two. Now, for the problem, n is given (degree of p(x)), and we need the maximum over all real polynomials of degree n, of the number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2.\n\nSo perhaps for general n, the maximum is 2n? But wait, when you square a degree n polynomial, you get a degree 2n polynomial. So 2n+1 coefficients. But the question is how many of these 2n+1 coefficients can be negative.\n\nBut wait, in the n=2 case, we could get 2 negative coefficients, which is 2*(2) - 2. Hmm. Alternatively, 2n - something. Let me think for higher n.\n\nSuppose n=3. Let's take p(x) of degree 3, so four coefficients. Let me try to construct p(x) such that p(x)^2 has as many negative coefficients as possible. Let's take p(x) =1 -x -x^2 -x^3. Then p(x)^2 would be:\n\n(1 -x -x^2 -x^3)^2. Let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, square each term: 1, x^2, x^4, x^6.\n\nThen cross terms:\n\n2*(1*(-x)) = -2x\n\n2*(1*(-x^2)) = -2x^2\n\n2*(1*(-x^3)) = -2x^3\n\n2*(-x)*(-x^2) = 2x^3\n\n2*(-x)*(-x^3) = 2x^4\n\n2*(-x^2)*(-x^3) = 2x^5\n\nAdding all together:\n\n1 -2x -2x^2 -2x^3 +2x^3 +2x^4 +x^2 +x^4 +x^6.\n\nWait, maybe my approach is messy. Alternatively, use the formula for coefficients. The coefficient of x^k in p(x)^2 is sum_{i=0}^k a_i a_{k-i} where a_i are coefficients of p(x). So in our case, a0=1, a1=-1, a2=-1, a3=-1.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nc0 = a0^2 =1\n\nc1 = 2a0a1 =2*1*(-1) = -2\n\nc2 = 2a0a2 + a1^2 = 2*1*(-1) + (-1)^2 = -2 +1 = -1\n\nc3 = 2a0a3 + 2a1a2 = 2*1*(-1) + 2*(-1)*(-1) = -2 +2=0\n\nc4 = 2a1a3 + a2^2 =2*(-1)*(-1) + (-1)^2= 2 +1=3\n\nc5 = 2a2a3 =2*(-1)*(-1)=2\n\nc6 =a3^2=1\n\nSo coefficients:1, -2, -1, 0, 3, 2,1. So negative coefficients are at x^1 and x^2, so two negatives. Hmm. Not great.\n\nWhat if p(x) is different. Let's try p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3. Then compute p(x)^2.\n\nCoefficient calculation:\n\nc0 =1^2=1\n\nc1=2*1*(-1)=-2\n\nc2=2*1*1 + (-1)^2=2+1=3\n\nc3=2*1*(-1) + 2*(-1)*1 = -2 -2=-4\n\nc4=2*(-1)*(-1) +1^2 +2*1*1=2+1+2=5? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me better do step by step.\n\nAlternatively, multiply (1 -x +x^2 -x^3) by itself:\n\n(1)(1) =1\n\n(1)(-x) + (-x)(1) = -x -x = -2x\n\n(1)(x^2) + (-x)(-x) + (x^2)(1) =x^2 +x^2 +x^2=3x^2\n\n(1)(-x^3) + (-x)(x^2) + (x^2)(-x) + (-x^3)(1) =-x^3 -x^3 -x^3 -x^3= -4x^3\n\nThen, terms from x^4 onward:\n\n(x^2)(x^2) + (-x)(-x^3) + (-x^3)(-x) + (x^2)(-x^3) + (-x^3)(x^2) + ... Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to compute each coefficient c_k as sum_{i=0}^k a_i a_{k-i}.\n\nSo coefficients:\n\nc0= a0^2=1\n\nc1= a0a1 + a1a0=2a0a1=2*1*(-1)=-2\n\nc2= a0a2 +a1a1 +a2a0=2a0a2 +a1^2=2*1*1 + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc3= a0a3 +a1a2 +a2a1 +a3a0=2a0a3 +2a1a2=2*1*(-1) + 2*(-1)*1= -2 -2= -4\n\nc4= a1a3 +a2a2 +a3a1=2a1a3 +a2^2=2*(-1)*(-1) +1^2=2 +1=3\n\nc5= a2a3 +a3a2=2a2a3=2*1*(-1)=-2\n\nc6= a3a3=(-1)^2=1\n\nSo the coefficients are:1, -2, 3, -4, 3, -2, 1. So negative coefficients at x^1, x^3, x^5. That's three negative coefficients. For n=3 (degree 3 polynomial), we get three negative coefficients in the square. So maybe for n=3, the maximum is 3. Hmm.\n\nThat's interesting. So when n=2, maximum is 2; when n=3, maximum is 3. So perhaps, the maximum number of negative coefficients is n? Wait, but wait, when n=2, the square has degree 4, and in the example above with n=3, the square has degree 6, and we had three negative coefficients. So for each n, maybe the maximum is n?\n\nBut let's check n=4. Let's try to construct a degree 4 polynomial whose square has four negative coefficients. Let me try p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4. Then p(x)^2 would be alternating signs? Let me compute coefficients:\n\na0=1, a1=-1, a2=1, a3=-1, a4=1.\n\nCompute c0=1^2=1\n\nc1=2*1*(-1)=-2\n\nc2=2*1*1 + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc3=2*1*(-1) +2*(-1)*1= -2 -2=-4\n\nc4=2*1*(1) +2*(-1)*(-1) +1^2=2 +2 +1=5\n\nc5=2*1*(-1) +2*(-1)*1 +2*1*(-1)= -2 -2 -2= -6\n\nWait, but this is getting messy. Let me use the general formula.\n\nAlternatively, note that p(x) = 1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4. Then p(x)^2 would be:\n\n(1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4)^2. Let's compute coefficients step by step.\n\nBut this might take time. Alternatively, maybe a pattern. If the polynomial is alternating in sign, then the coefficients of the square might alternate in some way.\n\nBut in the previous example with n=3, the square had coefficients 1, -2,3,-4,3,-2,1. Which gives three negative coefficients. For n=4, if p(x) is alternating, then maybe the coefficients of odd degrees would be negative. Let's see.\n\nSuppose p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4 -x^5 +... for higher degrees. Then when squaring, the cross terms might lead to negative coefficients. Wait, but in the previous example for n=3, p(x) had an even number of negative terms? Wait, no. For n=3, p(x) was 1 -x +x^2 -x^3. The square had three negative coefficients. Let's see for n=4, p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4.\n\nCompute some coefficients:\n\nc0 =1\n\nc1=2*(1*(-1))=-2\n\nc2=2*(1*1) + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc3=2*(1*(-1)) +2*(-1*1)= -2 -2=-4\n\nc4=2*(1*1) +2*(-1*(-1)) +1^2=2 +2 +1=5\n\nc5=2*(1*(-1)) +2*(-1*1) +2*(1*(-1))= -2 -2 -2= -6\n\nc6=2*(-1*(-1)) +2*(1*1) + (-1)^2=2 +2 +1=5\n\nc7=2*(1*(-1)) +2*(-1*1)= -2 -2= -4\n\nc8=2*(1*1)=2\n\nc8 should be 2*a4*a4? Wait, no. Wait for k=8, the coefficient is a4*a4=1*1=1. Wait, perhaps my earlier calculations are wrong. Let's actually do it properly.\n\nWait, the degree of p(x) is 4, so p(x)^2 is degree 8. Let's compute coefficients systematically:\n\nc0 = a0^2 =1\n\nc1= 2a0a1=2*(1*(-1))=-2\n\nc2=2a0a2 + a1^2=2*(1*1) + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc3=2a0a3 +2a1a2=2*(1*(-1)) +2*(-1*1)= -2 -2= -4\n\nc4=2a0a4 +2a1a3 +a2^2=2*(1*1)+2*(-1*(-1)) + (1)^2=2 +2 +1=5\n\nc5=2a1a4 +2a2a3=2*(-1*1) +2*(1*(-1))= -2 -2= -4\n\nc6=2a2a4 +a3^2=2*(1*1) + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc7=2a3a4=2*(-1*1)= -2\n\nc8=a4^2=1\n\nSo the coefficients are:1, -2,3,-4,5,-4,3,-2,1. So negative coefficients are at x^1, x^3, x^5, x^7. That's four negative coefficients for n=4. So that's four. So for n=4, max is four.\n\nSo the pattern seems that for each n, the maximum number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2 is n. Because in the case of n=2, we got two; n=3, three; n=4, four. So generalizing, maybe the maximum is n.\n\nBut wait, how? When we take an alternating polynomial p(x) with coefficients 1, -1,1,...,(-1)^n. Then when we square it, the resulting coefficients might alternate in sign for odd and even degrees. Wait, in the n=4 example, the square had negative coefficients at odd exponents 1,3,5,7, which is four negative coefficients. Since n=4, 2n=8, so exponents from 0 to 8. The odd exponents are four in number (1,3,5,7). So for each n, if we can get the square to have negative coefficients at all odd exponents up to 2n-1, that would be n negative coefficients. Because for degree n, the square has degree 2n, so exponents 0 to 2n. The odd exponents are 1,3,...,2n-1, which are n in number. So if we can make all those coefficients negative, then the maximum would be n.\n\nBut how to ensure that? Let's see for the example where p(x) is the alternating polynomial 1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +...+ (-1)^n x^n. Then when we square this polynomial, can we get all the odd degree coefficients to be negative?\n\nFor n=2, we saw that the coefficients were 1, -2, -2, 2,1. Wait, but in that case, the coefficients at x^1 and x^3 (which would be 1 and 3; but n=2, x^3 is present? Wait, n=2 is degree 2, so p(x)^2 is degree 4, so up to x^4. So for n=2, 2n=4. The odd exponents are 1 and 3. In that case, if n=2, we could get two negative coefficients. Earlier example with p(x) =1 -x -x^2 gave two negative coefficients at x and x^2, but that wasn't all the odd ones. Wait, maybe the choice of polynomial matters. If we take the alternating polynomial for n=2: p(x)=1 -x +x^2. Then p(x)^2 is 1 -2x +3x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. So here, coefficients at x^1 and x^3 are negative, which are two negative coefficients. So that works. For n=2, two negative coefficients (which are the odd exponents 1 and 3). For n=3, the polynomial p(x)=1 -x +x^2 -x^3 gives p(x)^2 with coefficients 1,-2,3,-4,3,-2,1. So here, negative coefficients at x^1, x^3, x^5 (but wait, x^5 is not present in this case? Wait, no: p(x) is degree 3, so p(x)^2 is degree 6. The coefficients would go up to x^6. So coefficients for exponents 0 to 6.\n\nWait, in the previous calculation for n=3, we had coefficients:1, -2,3,-4,3,-2,1. So exponents 0 to 6. The negative coefficients are at 1,3,5. Which are three in number. So that's three for n=3, which is the same as n.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, we saw four negative coefficients at 1,3,5,7, which is four. So indeed, when we take the alternating polynomial 1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +...+ (-1)^n x^n, then when squared, the coefficients at the odd exponents 1,3,...,2n-1 are negative. And the coefficients at even exponents are positive (assuming n is even). Wait, but in the n=3 case, which was odd, the coefficients at even exponents were positive? Let me check:\n\nFor n=3, p(x)=1 -x +x^2 -x^3. Then p(x)^2 had coefficients 1,-2,3,-4,3,-2,1. The even exponents (0,2,4,6) are positive (1,3,3,1). The odd exponents (1,3,5) are negative (-2,-4,-2). So yeah, all odd exponents are negative. Similarly, for n=4, even exponents positive, odd exponents negative. Therefore, the number of negative coefficients is n, because there are n odd exponents in the square p(x)^2, which has degree 2n. The exponents 1,3,...,2n-1 are n in number. Hence, if all these coefficients are negative, then n negative coefficients.\n\nBut why does this happen? Let's analyze in general. Suppose p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + ... + a_nx^n with a_i = (-1)^i. Then the coefficients of p(x)^2 would be c_k = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i (-1)^{k-i} } = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^k. Wait, but that would be (-1)^k*(k+1). Wait, no: each term in the sum is (-1)^i * (-1)^{k -i} = (-1)^k. Therefore, c_k = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^k = (k+1)*(-1)^k. Wait, but that can't be right. For example, in the case of n=2, p(x) =1 -x +x^2. Then p(x)^2 would have c_k = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i * (-1)^{k-i} = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^k = (k+1)(-1)^k. But in reality, when we computed for n=2, we got coefficients 1,-2,3,-2,1. But according to this formula, c0=1*(-1)^0=1, c1=2*(-1)^1=-2, c2=3*(-1)^2=3, c3=4*(-1)^3=-4, but in reality, c3 was 2 for n=2. Hmm, so my analysis is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when p(x) is of degree n, but when squaring, the coefficients c_k are sum_{i=0}^k a_i a_{k-i}. For a_i = (-1)^i, then a_i a_{k-i} = (-1)^i (-1)^{k-i} = (-1)^k. Therefore, c_k = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^k = (k+1)(-1)^k. But this is only true when k <= n, since for k > n, some a_{k-i} would be zero. Wait, but if p(x) is degree n, then a_i = (-1)^i for i=0,...,n, and a_i=0 otherwise. So when computing c_k for k <= 2n, the sum is over i from max(0,k-n) to min(k,n). Wait, that complicates things.\n\nWait, let's take p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3 + ... + (-1)^n x^n. Then for each coefficient c_k in p(x)^2, it's the sum of a_i a_{k-i} where i ranges from 0 to k, but since a_i is zero for i >n, and a_{k-i} is zero when k-i >n, i.e., i <k -n. So the sum is over i from max(0, k-n) to min(k, n). \n\nBut even so, the product a_i a_{k-i} would be (-1)^i * (-1)^{k-i} = (-1)^k. So each term in the sum is (-1)^k. Therefore, the number of terms in the sum is min(k, n) - max(0, k -n) +1. So for k <=n, the sum is from 0 to k, so k+1 terms, each contributing (-1)^k, so c_k = (k+1)(-1)^k.\n\nFor example, when k=0: c0=1*1=1.\n\nFor k=1: a0a1 +a1a0= (-1) + (-1) = -2 = (1+1)*(-1)^1 =2*(-1).\n\nFor k=2: a0a2 +a1a1 +a2a0=1*1 + (-1)(-1) +1*1=1 +1 +1=3. Which is (2+1)(-1)^2=3*1=3. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3 (n=3):\n\nc3= sum_{i=0}^3 a_i a_{3-i} =a0a3 +a1a2 +a2a1 +a3a0= (-1)^0*(-1)^3 + (-1)^1*(-1)^2 + (-1)^2*(-1)^1 + (-1)^3*(-1)^0= (-1)^3 + (-1)^3 + (-1)^3 + (-1)^3=4*(-1)^3= -4.\n\nWhich matches the earlier example.\n\nBut if k >n, say k=4 with n=3. Then c4= sum_{i=1}^3 a_i a_{3} (since i must be >=k -n=4-3=1). So i=1 to 3. Wait, wait, for k=4 and n=3:\n\nc4= a1a3 +a2a2 +a3a1= (-1)^1*(-1)^3 + (-1)^2*(-1)^2 + (-1)^3*(-1)^1= (-1)^{1+3} + (-1)^{2+2} + (-1)^{3+1}= (-1)^4 + (-1)^4 + (-1)^4=1 +1 +1=3. Which is (3-1+1) terms, i.e., 3 terms. Each term is (-1)^4=1. So c4=3*1=3. But according to the formula (k+1)(-1)^k, which for k=4 would be 5*1=5, which is not the case. Hence, the previous analysis only holds for k<=n.\n\nSo, for k <=n: c_k=(k+1)(-1)^k.\n\nFor k >n and <=2n: c_k= (2n -k +1)*(-1)^k.\n\nWait, let's check for k=4 and n=3: 2n -k +1=6 -4 +1=3. So c4=3*(-1)^4=3*1=3. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for k=5 and n=3: c5= (2*3 -5 +1)*(-1)^5= (6-5+1)*(-1)^5=2*(-1)^5= -2. Which matches the earlier example where c5=-2.\n\nSimilarly, for k=6 and n=3: c6=(2*3 -6 +1)*(-1)^6= (6-6+1)*1=1. Which was the case.\n\nTherefore, in general, for the polynomial p(x) with alternating coefficients, c_k= (k+1)(-1)^k for k=0 to n, and c_k=(2n -k +1)(-1)^k for k=n+1 to 2n.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients at positions k=0 to 2n are:\n\nFor even k: positive (since (-1)^k=1).\n\nFor odd k: negative (since (-1)^k=-1).\n\nWait, but that's only true if k <=n for the first part and k >n for the second part. Wait, for example, if k is odd and <=n, then c_k= (k+1)(  (-1)^k ), which would be negative. If k is odd and >n, then c_k= (2n -k +1)(-1)^k. Since k is odd, (-1)^k=-1. So c_k= - (2n -k +1). Since k >n and <=2n, 2n -k +1 is positive. So c_k is negative. Therefore, all odd coefficients are negative, and even coefficients are positive. Thus, in the square of the alternating polynomial p(x), every odd exponent term has a negative coefficient, and every even exponent term has a positive coefficient. Therefore, the number of negative coefficients is equal to the number of odd exponents in 0 to 2n, which is n. Because exponents 0 to 2n, there are 2n+1 terms. The number of odd exponents is n (since 1,3,...,2n-1).\n\nHence, when p(x) is an alternating polynomial with coefficients a_i=(-1)^i, then p(x)^2 has exactly n negative coefficients. Therefore, the maximum possible number of negative coefficients is at least n.\n\nBut we need to check if this is indeed the maximum. Is it possible to find a polynomial where the number of negative coefficients is more than n?\n\nSuppose, for example, for n=2, could we have three negative coefficients? But the square polynomial has degree 4, coefficients at x^0 to x^4. The odd exponents are 1 and 3. Wait, but in the example above for n=2, when p(x)=1 -x -x^2, the square had coefficients at x and x^2 negative. So two negatives, including an even exponent. So in that case, there are two negatives, but one is at even exponent. So by choosing different polynomials, can we have more negative coefficients?\n\nBut according to the previous analysis, if we use the alternating polynomial, we get two negative coefficients for n=2 (which is the maximum possible). When we use a different polynomial, like p(x)=1 -x -x^2, we also get two negatives, but one at even exponent. So it's still two.\n\nIs it possible to get three negative coefficients for n=2? Since in the square, there are five coefficients. To get three negatives, you would need three coefficients to be negative. Let's see. Let me try a different polynomial. Let p(x) =1 +x -x^2. Then p(x)^2=1 +2x -x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. Coefficients:1,2,-1,-2,1. So two negative coefficients. Still two. How about p(x) =1 -x -x^2. Then p(x)^2=1 -2x -2x^2 +2x^3 +x^4. Again two negative coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, take p(x)=a +bx +cx^2 with some coefficients such that multiple coefficients in the square are negative. Let's try to set more coefficients negative. Suppose we want c1, c2, c3 to be negative.\n\nc0 =a^2: must be positive.\n\nc1=2ab: negative if a and b have opposite signs.\n\nc2=2ac +b^2: negative if 2ac <b^2 and b^2 is negative? Wait, no. Since b^2 is always non-negative, and 2ac can be negative if a and c have opposite signs. So for c2 to be negative, 2ac +b^2 <0. But since b^2 >=0, this requires 2ac < -b^2. So 2ac has to be negative enough to overcome b^2.\n\nSimilarly, c3=2bc: negative if b and c have opposite signs.\n\nc4=c^2: positive.\n\nSo, suppose we set a=1, b negative, c negative. Let's set a=1, b=-k, c=-m, where k,m>0.\n\nThen:\n\nc1=2ab=2*1*(-k)=-2k (negative)\n\nc2=2ac +b^2=2*1*(-m) +k^2= -2m +k^2. To have this negative: -2m +k^2 <0 => k^2 <2m.\n\nc3=2bc=2*(-k)*(-m)=2km (positive, since k and m are positive). Hmm, so c3 is positive here. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if c is positive. Let's set a=1, b negative, c positive.\n\nThen c1=2ab= negative.\n\nc2=2ac +b^2=2*1*c +b^2. To have this negative, need 2c < -b^2. But c is positive, so 2c is positive. So 2c +b^2 is positive. So c2 is positive. So cannot get c2 negative here.\n\nAlternatively, if a is negative. Let a=-1, b positive, c positive.\n\nThen c0 =a^2=1.\n\nc1=2ab=2*(-1)*b= negative.\n\nc2=2ac +b^2=2*(-1)*c +b^2= -2c +b^2. To have negative, need b^2 <2c.\n\nc3=2bc=2*b*c= positive.\n\nSo here, c2 could be negative if b^2 <2c, but c3 is positive. So in this case, two negatives.\n\nBut this is not better than the previous examples.\n\nTherefore, maybe it's impossible to get three negative coefficients for n=2. Hence, the maximum is n=2.\n\nTherefore, the alternating polynomial gives exactly n negative coefficients, and this seems to be the maximum possible. Hence, the answer is n.\n\nBut wait, let's check for n=1. Wait, the problem states n>=2. So for n=2, the maximum is 2; for n=3, 3; and so on. Hence, the largest possible number is n. Therefore, the answer should be n.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSuppose we want as many negative coefficients as possible in p(x)^2. The coefficients of p(x)^2 are sums of products of pairs of coefficients of p(x). To make a particular coefficient c_k negative, the sum of products must be negative. However, squares of individual coefficients are non-negative, so the negative contributions must come from cross terms, i.e., products a_i a_j where i\u2260j. \n\nBut cross terms can be negative if a_i and a_j have opposite signs. But in order to maximize the number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2, we need to arrange the signs of the coefficients of p(x) such that as many sums (for each c_k) are negative. \n\nOne way to maximize this is to have p(x) with alternating signs, as we considered earlier. This choice leads to p(x)^2 having all odd coefficients negative and even coefficients positive. Since there are n odd degrees (1,3,...,2n-1) in p(x)^2 (which has degree 2n), this gives n negative coefficients. \n\nTo see if this is the maximum possible, note that for each negative coefficient in p(x)^2, we need to have the sum of products a_i a_{k-i} be negative. Since each a_i a_{k-i} can be positive or negative, depending on the signs of a_i and a_{k-i}, but the problem is that some terms are squares (like a_i^2 when k=2i), which are always non-negative. Therefore, for even k, there is a middle term a_{k/2}^2 which is non-negative. This makes it harder to get even coefficients to be negative. \n\nHowever, for odd k, there is no middle term, so all terms in the sum are products of distinct coefficients. If we can arrange the signs of the coefficients of p(x) so that all the cross terms for odd k are negative, then we can maximize the number of negative coefficients. The alternating polynomial achieves this, as each cross term for odd k ends up with a negative contribution.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2 is n, achieved by the alternating polynomial. Hence, the answer should be n, so the largest possible number is n.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To maximize the number of negative coefficients in \\( p(x)^2 \\), consider the alternating polynomial \\( p(x) = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^n x^n \\).

  "thinking": "Okay, so the problem is about finding the largest possible number of negative coefficients in the square of a real polynomial of degree n (where n is at least 2). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when you square a polynomial, the coefficients of the resulting polynomial are determined by the convolution of the coefficients of the original polynomial. So, if p(x) is a polynomial with coefficients a_0, a_1, ..., a_n, then p(x)^2 will have coefficients where each coefficient c_k is the sum of a_i * a_{k-i} for i from 0 to k. \n\nBut the question is about the number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2. We need to maximize that number. So, we need to arrange the coefficients of p(x) such that when we square it, as many coefficients as possible in the product are negative. \n\nWait a minute, but squares of real numbers are non-negative. However, when you multiply terms in the polynomial, cross terms can be negative. For example, if you have p(x) with both positive and negative coefficients, the products of different terms could lead to negative coefficients in p(x)^2. \n\nBut how do we maximize that? Let me consider some examples. Maybe small n first to get a pattern.\n\nTake n=2. Let p(x) = a + bx + cx^2. Then p(x)^2 = a^2 + 2abx + (2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2bc x^3 + c^2 x^4. All coefficients except perhaps the cross terms. Wait, but coefficients here: the coefficients of x^0 is a^2 (positive), x^1 is 2ab (could be negative if a and b have opposite signs), x^2 is 2ac + b^2. Hmm, the x^2 term: suppose a is positive and c is negative, then 2ac would be negative, but b^2 is positive. So maybe if 2ac is negative enough, but since a is squared, maybe not. Wait, but if a is positive, then c could be negative. Let me try numbers. Let p(x) = 1 - x - x^2. Then p(x)^2 = (1 - x -x^2)^2. Let's compute:\n\n(1)^2 =1. Then cross terms: 2*(1*(-x)) = -2x. 2*(1*(-x^2))= -2x^2. Then (-x)^2 =x^2, 2*(-x)*(-x^2)=2x^3. (-x^2)^2 =x^4. So combining all terms:\n\n1 -2x -2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4. So coefficients are 1, -2, -2, 2, 1. So two negative coefficients. But can we get more?\n\nWait, maybe if we have p(x) = 1 + x - x^2. Then p(x)^2 would be 1 + 2x + (2*(-1) +1) x^2 + 2*(-1)x^3 + x^4. So 1 +2x -1x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. Coefficients: 1,2,-1,-2,1. So two negative coefficients here as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, what if p(x) is 1 - x + x^2. Then p(x)^2 is 1 -2x +3x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. Coefficients: 1,-2,3,-2,1. So two negative coefficients again.\n\nWait, is it possible to get three negative coefficients for n=2? Let's see. Suppose p(x) has more terms. Wait, the original p(x) is degree 2, so three coefficients. Let's choose coefficients such that when we square, multiple cross terms lead to negatives.\n\nSuppose p(x) = a + bx + cx^2, and we want as many coefficients in p(x)^2 to be negative. Let's try:\n\nSuppose a is positive, b is negative, c is positive. Then:\n\nc_0 = a^2 (positive)\nc_1 = 2ab (negative since a positive, b negative)\nc_2 = 2ac + b^2 (positive, because 2ac is positive if a and c are positive, and b^2 is positive)\nc_3 = 2bc (negative if b is negative and c positive)\nc_4 = c^2 (positive)\n\nSo in this case, coefficients at x^1 and x^3 would be negative. So two negative coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, if c is negative. Let's try a=1, b=1, c=-1. Then p(x) =1 +x -x^2. Then p(x)^2:\n\n1 +2x + ( -2 +1 )x^2 + (-2)x^3 + x^4. So coefficients 1,2,-1,-2,1. Two negative coefficients. \n\nWait, another case: a negative, b positive, c positive. Let p(x) = -1 +x +x^2. Then p(x)^2 =1 -2x -x^2 +2x^3 +x^4. Coefficients:1, -2, -1, 2,1. Here, two negative coefficients again. \n\nHmm. So for n=2, the maximum number of negative coefficients seems to be 2. But maybe 3?\n\nWait, is there a way? Let's see. Suppose p(x) is 1 -x -x^2. Then p(x)^2 is 1 -2x -2x^2 + 2x^3 +x^4. So coefficients 1, -2, -2, 2,1. Here, two negative coefficients (at x and x^2). So that's two. If we can find a p(x) where three coefficients are negative. Let's see. Suppose p(x) =1 +x -x^2. Then coefficients in p(x)^2:1, 2, ( -2 +1)= -1, -2, 1. So coefficients 1,2,-1,-2,1. So two negative coefficients. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we have higher coefficients canceling terms? Not sure. Maybe not possible. So for n=2, maximum is two. But wait, the polynomial p(x)^2 is of degree 4, so five coefficients. The maximum number of negative coefficients is two. Now, for the problem, n is given (degree of p(x)), and we need the maximum over all real polynomials of degree n, of the number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2.\n\nSo perhaps for general n, the maximum is 2n? But wait, when you square a degree n polynomial, you get a degree 2n polynomial. So 2n+1 coefficients. But the question is how many of these 2n+1 coefficients can be negative.\n\nBut wait, in the n=2 case, we could get 2 negative coefficients, which is 2*(2) - 2. Hmm. Alternatively, 2n - something. Let me think for higher n.\n\nSuppose n=3. Let's take p(x) of degree 3, so four coefficients. Let me try to construct p(x) such that p(x)^2 has as many negative coefficients as possible. Let's take p(x) =1 -x -x^2 -x^3. Then p(x)^2 would be:\n\n(1 -x -x^2 -x^3)^2. Let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, square each term: 1, x^2, x^4, x^6.\n\nThen cross terms:\n\n2*(1*(-x)) = -2x\n\n2*(1*(-x^2)) = -2x^2\n\n2*(1*(-x^3)) = -2x^3\n\n2*(-x)*(-x^2) = 2x^3\n\n2*(-x)*(-x^3) = 2x^4\n\n2*(-x^2)*(-x^3) = 2x^5\n\nAdding all together:\n\n1 -2x -2x^2 -2x^3 +2x^3 +2x^4 +x^2 +x^4 +x^6.\n\nWait, maybe my approach is messy. Alternatively, use the formula for coefficients. The coefficient of x^k in p(x)^2 is sum_{i=0}^k a_i a_{k-i} where a_i are coefficients of p(x). So in our case, a0=1, a1=-1, a2=-1, a3=-1.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nc0 = a0^2 =1\n\nc1 = 2a0a1 =2*1*(-1) = -2\n\nc2 = 2a0a2 + a1^2 = 2*1*(-1) + (-1)^2 = -2 +1 = -1\n\nc3 = 2a0a3 + 2a1a2 = 2*1*(-1) + 2*(-1)*(-1) = -2 +2=0\n\nc4 = 2a1a3 + a2^2 =2*(-1)*(-1) + (-1)^2= 2 +1=3\n\nc5 = 2a2a3 =2*(-1)*(-1)=2\n\nc6 =a3^2=1\n\nSo coefficients:1, -2, -1, 0, 3, 2,1. So negative coefficients are at x^1 and x^2, so two negatives. Hmm. Not great.\n\nWhat if p(x) is different. Let's try p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3. Then compute p(x)^2.\n\nCoefficient calculation:\n\nc0 =1^2=1\n\nc1=2*1*(-1)=-2\n\nc2=2*1*1 + (-1)^2=2+1=3\n\nc3=2*1*(-1) + 2*(-1)*1 = -2 -2=-4\n\nc4=2*(-1)*(-1) +1^2 +2*1*1=2+1+2=5? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me better do step by step.\n\nAlternatively, multiply (1 -x +x^2 -x^3) by itself:\n\n(1)(1) =1\n\n(1)(-x) + (-x)(1) = -x -x = -2x\n\n(1)(x^2) + (-x)(-x) + (x^2)(1) =x^2 +x^2 +x^2=3x^2\n\n(1)(-x^3) + (-x)(x^2) + (x^2)(-x) + (-x^3)(1) =-x^3 -x^3 -x^3 -x^3= -4x^3\n\nThen, terms from x^4 onward:\n\n(x^2)(x^2) + (-x)(-x^3) + (-x^3)(-x) + (x^2)(-x^3) + (-x^3)(x^2) + ... Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to compute each coefficient c_k as sum_{i=0}^k a_i a_{k-i}.\n\nSo coefficients:\n\nc0= a0^2=1\n\nc1= a0a1 + a1a0=2a0a1=2*1*(-1)=-2\n\nc2= a0a2 +a1a1 +a2a0=2a0a2 +a1^2=2*1*1 + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc3= a0a3 +a1a2 +a2a1 +a3a0=2a0a3 +2a1a2=2*1*(-1) + 2*(-1)*1= -2 -2= -4\n\nc4= a1a3 +a2a2 +a3a1=2a1a3 +a2^2=2*(-1)*(-1) +1^2=2 +1=3\n\nc5= a2a3 +a3a2=2a2a3=2*1*(-1)=-2\n\nc6= a3a3=(-1)^2=1\n\nSo the coefficients are:1, -2, 3, -4, 3, -2, 1. So negative coefficients at x^1, x^3, x^5. That's three negative coefficients. For n=3 (degree 3 polynomial), we get three negative coefficients in the square. So maybe for n=3, the maximum is 3. Hmm.\n\nThat's interesting. So when n=2, maximum is 2; when n=3, maximum is 3. So perhaps, the maximum number of negative coefficients is n? Wait, but wait, when n=2, the square has degree 4, and in the example above with n=3, the square has degree 6, and we had three negative coefficients. So for each n, maybe the maximum is n?\n\nBut let's check n=4. Let's try to construct a degree 4 polynomial whose square has four negative coefficients. Let me try p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4. Then p(x)^2 would be alternating signs? Let me compute coefficients:\n\na0=1, a1=-1, a2=1, a3=-1, a4=1.\n\nCompute c0=1^2=1\n\nc1=2*1*(-1)=-2\n\nc2=2*1*1 + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc3=2*1*(-1) +2*(-1)*1= -2 -2=-4\n\nc4=2*1*(1) +2*(-1)*(-1) +1^2=2 +2 +1=5\n\nc5=2*1*(-1) +2*(-1)*1 +2*1*(-1)= -2 -2 -2= -6\n\nWait, but this is getting messy. Let me use the general formula.\n\nAlternatively, note that p(x) = 1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4. Then p(x)^2 would be:\n\n(1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4)^2. Let's compute coefficients step by step.\n\nBut this might take time. Alternatively, maybe a pattern. If the polynomial is alternating in sign, then the coefficients of the square might alternate in some way.\n\nBut in the previous example with n=3, the square had coefficients 1, -2,3,-4,3,-2,1. Which gives three negative coefficients. For n=4, if p(x) is alternating, then maybe the coefficients of odd degrees would be negative. Let's see.\n\nSuppose p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4 -x^5 +... for higher degrees. Then when squaring, the cross terms might lead to negative coefficients. Wait, but in the previous example for n=3, p(x) had an even number of negative terms? Wait, no. For n=3, p(x) was 1 -x +x^2 -x^3. The square had three negative coefficients. Let's see for n=4, p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +x^4.\n\nCompute some coefficients:\n\nc0 =1\n\nc1=2*(1*(-1))=-2\n\nc2=2*(1*1) + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc3=2*(1*(-1)) +2*(-1*1)= -2 -2=-4\n\nc4=2*(1*1) +2*(-1*(-1)) +1^2=2 +2 +1=5\n\nc5=2*(1*(-1)) +2*(-1*1) +2*(1*(-1))= -2 -2 -2= -6\n\nc6=2*(-1*(-1)) +2*(1*1) + (-1)^2=2 +2 +1=5\n\nc7=2*(1*(-1)) +2*(-1*1)= -2 -2= -4\n\nc8=2*(1*1)=2\n\nc8 should be 2*a4*a4? Wait, no. Wait for k=8, the coefficient is a4*a4=1*1=1. Wait, perhaps my earlier calculations are wrong. Let's actually do it properly.\n\nWait, the degree of p(x) is 4, so p(x)^2 is degree 8. Let's compute coefficients systematically:\n\nc0 = a0^2 =1\n\nc1= 2a0a1=2*(1*(-1))=-2\n\nc2=2a0a2 + a1^2=2*(1*1) + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc3=2a0a3 +2a1a2=2*(1*(-1)) +2*(-1*1)= -2 -2= -4\n\nc4=2a0a4 +2a1a3 +a2^2=2*(1*1)+2*(-1*(-1)) + (1)^2=2 +2 +1=5\n\nc5=2a1a4 +2a2a3=2*(-1*1) +2*(1*(-1))= -2 -2= -4\n\nc6=2a2a4 +a3^2=2*(1*1) + (-1)^2=2 +1=3\n\nc7=2a3a4=2*(-1*1)= -2\n\nc8=a4^2=1\n\nSo the coefficients are:1, -2,3,-4,5,-4,3,-2,1. So negative coefficients are at x^1, x^3, x^5, x^7. That's four negative coefficients for n=4. So that's four. So for n=4, max is four.\n\nSo the pattern seems that for each n, the maximum number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2 is n. Because in the case of n=2, we got two; n=3, three; n=4, four. So generalizing, maybe the maximum is n.\n\nBut wait, how? When we take an alternating polynomial p(x) with coefficients 1, -1,1,...,(-1)^n. Then when we square it, the resulting coefficients might alternate in sign for odd and even degrees. Wait, in the n=4 example, the square had negative coefficients at odd exponents 1,3,5,7, which is four negative coefficients. Since n=4, 2n=8, so exponents from 0 to 8. The odd exponents are four in number (1,3,5,7). So for each n, if we can get the square to have negative coefficients at all odd exponents up to 2n-1, that would be n negative coefficients. Because for degree n, the square has degree 2n, so exponents 0 to 2n. The odd exponents are 1,3,...,2n-1, which are n in number. So if we can make all those coefficients negative, then the maximum would be n.\n\nBut how to ensure that? Let's see for the example where p(x) is the alternating polynomial 1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +...+ (-1)^n x^n. Then when we square this polynomial, can we get all the odd degree coefficients to be negative?\n\nFor n=2, we saw that the coefficients were 1, -2, -2, 2,1. Wait, but in that case, the coefficients at x^1 and x^3 (which would be 1 and 3; but n=2, x^3 is present? Wait, n=2 is degree 2, so p(x)^2 is degree 4, so up to x^4. So for n=2, 2n=4. The odd exponents are 1 and 3. In that case, if n=2, we could get two negative coefficients. Earlier example with p(x) =1 -x -x^2 gave two negative coefficients at x and x^2, but that wasn't all the odd ones. Wait, maybe the choice of polynomial matters. If we take the alternating polynomial for n=2: p(x)=1 -x +x^2. Then p(x)^2 is 1 -2x +3x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. So here, coefficients at x^1 and x^3 are negative, which are two negative coefficients. So that works. For n=2, two negative coefficients (which are the odd exponents 1 and 3). For n=3, the polynomial p(x)=1 -x +x^2 -x^3 gives p(x)^2 with coefficients 1,-2,3,-4,3,-2,1. So here, negative coefficients at x^1, x^3, x^5 (but wait, x^5 is not present in this case? Wait, no: p(x) is degree 3, so p(x)^2 is degree 6. The coefficients would go up to x^6. So coefficients for exponents 0 to 6.\n\nWait, in the previous calculation for n=3, we had coefficients:1, -2,3,-4,3,-2,1. So exponents 0 to 6. The negative coefficients are at 1,3,5. Which are three in number. So that's three for n=3, which is the same as n.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, we saw four negative coefficients at 1,3,5,7, which is four. So indeed, when we take the alternating polynomial 1 -x +x^2 -x^3 +...+ (-1)^n x^n, then when squared, the coefficients at the odd exponents 1,3,...,2n-1 are negative. And the coefficients at even exponents are positive (assuming n is even). Wait, but in the n=3 case, which was odd, the coefficients at even exponents were positive? Let me check:\n\nFor n=3, p(x)=1 -x +x^2 -x^3. Then p(x)^2 had coefficients 1,-2,3,-4,3,-2,1. The even exponents (0,2,4,6) are positive (1,3,3,1). The odd exponents (1,3,5) are negative (-2,-4,-2). So yeah, all odd exponents are negative. Similarly, for n=4, even exponents positive, odd exponents negative. Therefore, the number of negative coefficients is n, because there are n odd exponents in the square p(x)^2, which has degree 2n. The exponents 1,3,...,2n-1 are n in number. Hence, if all these coefficients are negative, then n negative coefficients.\n\nBut why does this happen? Let's analyze in general. Suppose p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + ... + a_nx^n with a_i = (-1)^i. Then the coefficients of p(x)^2 would be c_k = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i (-1)^{k-i} } = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^k. Wait, but that would be (-1)^k*(k+1). Wait, no: each term in the sum is (-1)^i * (-1)^{k -i} = (-1)^k. Therefore, c_k = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^k = (k+1)*(-1)^k. Wait, but that can't be right. For example, in the case of n=2, p(x) =1 -x +x^2. Then p(x)^2 would have c_k = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i * (-1)^{k-i} = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^k = (k+1)(-1)^k. But in reality, when we computed for n=2, we got coefficients 1,-2,3,-2,1. But according to this formula, c0=1*(-1)^0=1, c1=2*(-1)^1=-2, c2=3*(-1)^2=3, c3=4*(-1)^3=-4, but in reality, c3 was 2 for n=2. Hmm, so my analysis is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when p(x) is of degree n, but when squaring, the coefficients c_k are sum_{i=0}^k a_i a_{k-i}. For a_i = (-1)^i, then a_i a_{k-i} = (-1)^i (-1)^{k-i} = (-1)^k. Therefore, c_k = sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^k = (k+1)(-1)^k. But this is only true when k <= n, since for k > n, some a_{k-i} would be zero. Wait, but if p(x) is degree n, then a_i = (-1)^i for i=0,...,n, and a_i=0 otherwise. So when computing c_k for k <= 2n, the sum is over i from max(0,k-n) to min(k,n). Wait, that complicates things.\n\nWait, let's take p(x) =1 -x +x^2 -x^3 + ... + (-1)^n x^n. Then for each coefficient c_k in p(x)^2, it's the sum of a_i a_{k-i} where i ranges from 0 to k, but since a_i is zero for i >n, and a_{k-i} is zero when k-i >n, i.e., i <k -n. So the sum is over i from max(0, k-n) to min(k, n). \n\nBut even so, the product a_i a_{k-i} would be (-1)^i * (-1)^{k-i} = (-1)^k. So each term in the sum is (-1)^k. Therefore, the number of terms in the sum is min(k, n) - max(0, k -n) +1. So for k <=n, the sum is from 0 to k, so k+1 terms, each contributing (-1)^k, so c_k = (k+1)(-1)^k.\n\nFor example, when k=0: c0=1*1=1.\n\nFor k=1: a0a1 +a1a0= (-1) + (-1) = -2 = (1+1)*(-1)^1 =2*(-1).\n\nFor k=2: a0a2 +a1a1 +a2a0=1*1 + (-1)(-1) +1*1=1 +1 +1=3. Which is (2+1)(-1)^2=3*1=3. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3 (n=3):\n\nc3= sum_{i=0}^3 a_i a_{3-i} =a0a3 +a1a2 +a2a1 +a3a0= (-1)^0*(-1)^3 + (-1)^1*(-1)^2 + (-1)^2*(-1)^1 + (-1)^3*(-1)^0= (-1)^3 + (-1)^3 + (-1)^3 + (-1)^3=4*(-1)^3= -4.\n\nWhich matches the earlier example.\n\nBut if k >n, say k=4 with n=3. Then c4= sum_{i=1}^3 a_i a_{3} (since i must be >=k -n=4-3=1). So i=1 to 3. Wait, wait, for k=4 and n=3:\n\nc4= a1a3 +a2a2 +a3a1= (-1)^1*(-1)^3 + (-1)^2*(-1)^2 + (-1)^3*(-1)^1= (-1)^{1+3} + (-1)^{2+2} + (-1)^{3+1}= (-1)^4 + (-1)^4 + (-1)^4=1 +1 +1=3. Which is (3-1+1) terms, i.e., 3 terms. Each term is (-1)^4=1. So c4=3*1=3. But according to the formula (k+1)(-1)^k, which for k=4 would be 5*1=5, which is not the case. Hence, the previous analysis only holds for k<=n.\n\nSo, for k <=n: c_k=(k+1)(-1)^k.\n\nFor k >n and <=2n: c_k= (2n -k +1)*(-1)^k.\n\nWait, let's check for k=4 and n=3: 2n -k +1=6 -4 +1=3. So c4=3*(-1)^4=3*1=3. Which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for k=5 and n=3: c5= (2*3 -5 +1)*(-1)^5= (6-5+1)*(-1)^5=2*(-1)^5= -2. Which matches the earlier example where c5=-2.\n\nSimilarly, for k=6 and n=3: c6=(2*3 -6 +1)*(-1)^6= (6-6+1)*1=1. Which was the case.\n\nTherefore, in general, for the polynomial p(x) with alternating coefficients, c_k= (k+1)(-1)^k for k=0 to n, and c_k=(2n -k +1)(-1)^k for k=n+1 to 2n.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients at positions k=0 to 2n are:\n\nFor even k: positive (since (-1)^k=1).\n\nFor odd k: negative (since (-1)^k=-1).\n\nWait, but that's only true if k <=n for the first part and k >n for the second part. Wait, for example, if k is odd and <=n, then c_k= (k+1)(  (-1)^k ), which would be negative. If k is odd and >n, then c_k= (2n -k +1)(-1)^k. Since k is odd, (-1)^k=-1. So c_k= - (2n -k +1). Since k >n and <=2n, 2n -k +1 is positive. So c_k is negative. Therefore, all odd coefficients are negative, and even coefficients are positive. Thus, in the square of the alternating polynomial p(x), every odd exponent term has a negative coefficient, and every even exponent term has a positive coefficient. Therefore, the number of negative coefficients is equal to the number of odd exponents in 0 to 2n, which is n. Because exponents 0 to 2n, there are 2n+1 terms. The number of odd exponents is n (since 1,3,...,2n-1).\n\nHence, when p(x) is an alternating polynomial with coefficients a_i=(-1)^i, then p(x)^2 has exactly n negative coefficients. Therefore, the maximum possible number of negative coefficients is at least n.\n\nBut we need to check if this is indeed the maximum. Is it possible to find a polynomial where the number of negative coefficients is more than n?\n\nSuppose, for example, for n=2, could we have three negative coefficients? But the square polynomial has degree 4, coefficients at x^0 to x^4. The odd exponents are 1 and 3. Wait, but in the example above for n=2, when p(x)=1 -x -x^2, the square had coefficients at x and x^2 negative. So two negatives, including an even exponent. So in that case, there are two negatives, but one is at even exponent. So by choosing different polynomials, can we have more negative coefficients?\n\nBut according to the previous analysis, if we use the alternating polynomial, we get two negative coefficients for n=2 (which is the maximum possible). When we use a different polynomial, like p(x)=1 -x -x^2, we also get two negatives, but one at even exponent. So it's still two.\n\nIs it possible to get three negative coefficients for n=2? Since in the square, there are five coefficients. To get three negatives, you would need three coefficients to be negative. Let's see. Let me try a different polynomial. Let p(x) =1 +x -x^2. Then p(x)^2=1 +2x -x^2 -2x^3 +x^4. Coefficients:1,2,-1,-2,1. So two negative coefficients. Still two. How about p(x) =1 -x -x^2. Then p(x)^2=1 -2x -2x^2 +2x^3 +x^4. Again two negative coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, take p(x)=a +bx +cx^2 with some coefficients such that multiple coefficients in the square are negative. Let's try to set more coefficients negative. Suppose we want c1, c2, c3 to be negative.\n\nc0 =a^2: must be positive.\n\nc1=2ab: negative if a and b have opposite signs.\n\nc2=2ac +b^2: negative if 2ac <b^2 and b^2 is negative? Wait, no. Since b^2 is always non-negative, and 2ac can be negative if a and c have opposite signs. So for c2 to be negative, 2ac +b^2 <0. But since b^2 >=0, this requires 2ac < -b^2. So 2ac has to be negative enough to overcome b^2.\n\nSimilarly, c3=2bc: negative if b and c have opposite signs.\n\nc4=c^2: positive.\n\nSo, suppose we set a=1, b negative, c negative. Let's set a=1, b=-k, c=-m, where k,m>0.\n\nThen:\n\nc1=2ab=2*1*(-k)=-2k (negative)\n\nc2=2ac +b^2=2*1*(-m) +k^2= -2m +k^2. To have this negative: -2m +k^2 <0 => k^2 <2m.\n\nc3=2bc=2*(-k)*(-m)=2km (positive, since k and m are positive). Hmm, so c3 is positive here. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if c is positive. Let's set a=1, b negative, c positive.\n\nThen c1=2ab= negative.\n\nc2=2ac +b^2=2*1*c +b^2. To have this negative, need 2c < -b^2. But c is positive, so 2c is positive. So 2c +b^2 is positive. So c2 is positive. So cannot get c2 negative here.\n\nAlternatively, if a is negative. Let a=-1, b positive, c positive.\n\nThen c0 =a^2=1.\n\nc1=2ab=2*(-1)*b= negative.\n\nc2=2ac +b^2=2*(-1)*c +b^2= -2c +b^2. To have negative, need b^2 <2c.\n\nc3=2bc=2*b*c= positive.\n\nSo here, c2 could be negative if b^2 <2c, but c3 is positive. So in this case, two negatives.\n\nBut this is not better than the previous examples.\n\nTherefore, maybe it's impossible to get three negative coefficients for n=2. Hence, the maximum is n=2.\n\nTherefore, the alternating polynomial gives exactly n negative coefficients, and this seems to be the maximum possible. Hence, the answer is n.\n\nBut wait, let's check for n=1. Wait, the problem states n>=2. So for n=2, the maximum is 2; for n=3, 3; and so on. Hence, the largest possible number is n. Therefore, the answer should be n.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSuppose we want as many negative coefficients as possible in p(x)^2. The coefficients of p(x)^2 are sums of products of pairs of coefficients of p(x). To make a particular coefficient c_k negative, the sum of products must be negative. However, squares of individual coefficients are non-negative, so the negative contributions must come from cross terms, i.e., products a_i a_j where i\u2260j. \n\nBut cross terms can be negative if a_i and a_j have opposite signs. But in order to maximize the number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2, we need to arrange the signs of the coefficients of p(x) such that as many sums (for each c_k) are negative. \n\nOne way to maximize this is to have p(x) with alternating signs, as we considered earlier. This choice leads to p(x)^2 having all odd coefficients negative and even coefficients positive. Since there are n odd degrees (1,3,...,2n-1) in p(x)^2 (which has degree 2n), this gives n negative coefficients. \n\nTo see if this is the maximum possible, note that for each negative coefficient in p(x)^2, we need to have the sum of products a_i a_{k-i} be negative. Since each a_i a_{k-i} can be positive or negative, depending on the signs of a_i and a_{k-i}, but the problem is that some terms are squares (like a_i^2 when k=2i), which are always non-negative. Therefore, for even k, there is a middle term a_{k/2}^2 which is non-negative. This makes it harder to get even coefficients to be negative. \n\nHowever, for odd k, there is no middle term, so all terms in the sum are products of distinct coefficients. If we can arrange the signs of the coefficients of p(x) so that all the cross terms for odd k are negative, then we can maximize the number of negative coefficients. The alternating polynomial achieves this, as each cross term for odd k ends up with a negative contribution.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of negative coefficients in p(x)^2 is n, achieved by the alternating polynomial. Hence, the answer should be n, so the largest possible number is n.",
