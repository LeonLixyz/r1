  "question": "In the Feynman path integral formalism, what is the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \u03f5_k?\n\n",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to work through this question. The question is about the Feynman path integral formalism and the bare Green's function G_0's dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \u03b5_k. Hmm, I need to recall what I know about Green's functions in this context.\n\nFirst, the Feynman path integral approach is a way to quantize systems by considering all possible paths. For Green's functions, which are propagators, the bare Green's function G_0 would be the non-interacting case. In other words, when there are no interactions between particles, the Green's function is 'bare' and doesn't include any self-energy corrections from interactions.\n\nIn the case of non-interacting systems, the Green's function can often be expressed in terms of the single-particle energy eigenvalues. I remember that for the time-ordered Green's function in the frequency domain, the form is something like 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7 sgn(\u03b5_k - \u03bc)) where \u03b7 is an infinitesimal positive number and \u03bc is the chemical potential. But wait, maybe that's the advanced or retarded Green's function? Or is that for the time-ordered one?\n\nAlternatively, in the Matsubara formalism (finite temperature, imaginary time), the Green's function would be 1/(i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k + \u03bc), where \u03c9_n are the Matsubara frequencies. But the question isn't specifying imaginary time, so maybe it's the real-time or zero-temperature case.\n\nBut the question is about the functional dependence of G_0 on \u03b5_k. So regardless of the specific form, the key point is how G_0 is expressed in terms of \u03b5_k. The denominator usually has (i\u03c9 - \u03b5_k) or (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k). Wait, in the zero-temperature formalism, the time-ordered Green's function for non-interacting particles is G_0(k, \u03c9) = 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7), where \u03b7 approaches zero from the positive side. The +i\u03b7 ensures the correct pole structure for time ordering. So the dependence here is inversely proportional to (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k), so G_0 ~ 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7).\n\nBut the question isn't asking about the frequency dependence. Wait, the question is about the functional dependence on \u03b5_k. So if you have \u03b5_k in the denominator as (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k), then G_0 is inversely proportional to (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7). So the functional dependence would be 1/(something involving \u03b5_k), which is a linear term in the denominator. So G_0 is inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - \u03c9 - i\u03b7) or similar. Alternatively, depending on conventions, perhaps it's written as 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9 \u00b1 i\u03b7), but the key is that \u03b5_k is in the denominator as a linear term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about whether G_0 is proportional to 1/\u03b5_k, but that doesn't seem right. Because in the Green's function expression, the energy eigenvalues \u03b5_k are part of the denominator with the frequency variable. So if you fix the frequency \u03c9, then G_0 would depend on 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k) or similar. So the functional dependence is 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9) or 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k), depending on sign conventions. But since the question is phrased as \"functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \u03b5_k\", the answer would involve G_0 being inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - something), so like 1/(\u03b5_k - ...). Therefore, the answer should be G_0 ~ 1/(\u03b5_k - ...).\n\nBut wait, the answer choices were not given. The user is asking me to provide the answer. Wait, the original question is multiple-choice? No, the user says \"output the answer to the question following the format\". So maybe the answer is simply stating that the bare Green's function G_0 depends inversely on \u03b5_k in a linear fashion. But how exactly?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that G_0 is proportional to 1/(i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k) in Matsubara formalism. But the question didn't specify Matsubara. Alternatively, in real frequency, 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b4). But the key is that the denominator is linear in \u03b5_k, so G_0 is inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - ...) So the functional dependence is inverse linear in \u03b5_k. Wait, but the function depends on both \u03c9 and \u03b5_k. So the answer would be that the bare Green's function G_0 depends as the inverse of (i\u03c9 - \u03b5_k), leading to 1/(i\u03c9 - \u03b5_k) or similar.\n\nBut considering the options that might be presented (though since it's an open response), the answer is that the bare Green's function G0 is inversely proportional to the single-particle energy eigenvalues \u03b5_k (or more precisely, to (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k)), but I need to get the exact dependence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is more about the dependence of G0 on \u03b5_k in position space, but no, the question is about functional dependence in terms of the energy eigenvalues. So in momentum space, the Green's function is diagonal and each mode k has a Green's function that's 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7 sgn(...)) as I thought before.\n\nSo the answer is that the bare Green's function has a functional dependence of 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7) for each mode k, hence it's inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - \u03c9), which can be written as G0 ~ 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9). But the exact form depends on the convention of signs. However, the structure is that G0 has a simple pole at the energy eigenvalue \u03b5_k. So the key point is that G_0 depends as the inverse of (\u03b5_k - ...) So the answer is that G0 is inversely proportional to \u03b5_k in combination with the frequency, but the main dependence is 1/(something involving \u03b5_k).\n\nThe question is specifically about the functional dependence on \u03b5_k. So for each mode k, G_0(k, \u03c9) is proportional to 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7). So the denominator is (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k) with a small imaginary part. Therefore, the dependence on \u03b5_k is linear in the denominator, making the Green's function inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - \u03c9) (if we factor out a negative sign). So the answer would involve G0 being proportional to 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9 + i\u03b7), but the sign might vary based on conventions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that the bare Green's function is proportional to 1/(i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k) in Matsubara formalism. The question doesn't specify real or imaginary time, but in the path integral formalism, often the imaginary time (Matsubara) formalism is used. So G0 would be 1/(i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k) where \u03c9_n are Matsubara frequencies. So the denominator is linear in \u03b5_k, hence inverse proportionality.\n\nBut again, the question is about the dependence on \u03b5_k. So regardless of whether it's i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k or \u03c9 - \u03b5_k, the dependence is inverse. So the functional dependence is G0 ~ 1/(\u03b5_k - ...), but the exact form would be either (i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k) or (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7). However, the question isn't asking for the full expression but the functional dependence. So the answer should be that the bare Green's function G0 depends inversely on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \u03b5_k, specifically G0 is proportional to 1/(\u03b5_k - ...). Therefore, the correct answer is that the bare Green's function G0 is inversely proportional to \u03b5_k (relative to the frequency term).\n\nSo putting this all together, the answer is that G0 has a functional dependence of 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7), which means that the dependence on \u03b5_k is linear in the denominator. Thus, the answer is that G0 is inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - \u03c9), but phrased correctly, the answer would be that G0 depends as 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9) or similar. Since the problem is in the context of the Feynman path integral, and the bare Green's function typically for non-interacting particles would have this structure.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the bare Green's function G_0 is inversely proportional to the single-particle energy eigenvalues \u03b5_k (specifically, with a term involving the frequency subtracted), but here the key functional dependence on \u03b5_k is inverse. Since the question is specifically about the dependence on \u03b5_k, the answer would state that G0 is inversely proportional to (i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k) in the Matsubara case or (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7) in the real-time case. So the functional dependence is 1/(\u03b5_k - ...). Therefore, the correct answer is that the bare Green's function G0 depends as 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9) or similar. However, since the possible answer options are not given, but the question is presented as open-ended, the answer is that the bare Green's function G_0 in the Feynman path integral formalism is inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - \u03c9), which can be written as 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9 + i\u03b4), where \u03b4 is an infinitesimal. Therefore, the functional dependence on \u03b5_k is inverse linear, i.e., inversely proportional to \u03b5_k minus a term involving frequency.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \u03b5_k\". So maybe it's more precise to say that G_0 is proportional to 1/(i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k) (in Matsubara) or 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7) (in real frequency), hence the functional dependence is 1/(\u03b5_k - ...), but since the question is not specific to frequency, perhaps the answer is that G_0 is inversely proportional to \u03b5_k. But that's not correct because it's not just 1/\u03b5_k, but 1/(something with \u03b5_k). But the problem is that the Green's function depends on both \u03b5_k and the frequency \u03c9. So when considering dependence on \u03b5_k for a fixed \u03c9, it's 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k), but the question is general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the time-ordered Green's function, which for non-interacting particles is G0(k, \u03c9) = 1/(\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7 sgn(\u03b5_k - \u03bc)). In that case, the denominator has (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k), making G0 inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - \u03c9). Therefore, the functional dependence is inverse, as G0 ~ 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9).\n\nSo putting this all together, the explanation would be that the bare Green's function G0 in the Feynman path integral formalism is given by the inverse of (i\u03c9_n - \u03b5_k) in Matsubara formalism or (\u03c9 - \u03b5_k + i\u03b7) in real time, leading to a functional dependence on \u03b5_k that is inversely proportional to (\u03b5_k - \u03c9). Therefore, the answer is that G0 depends inversely on (\u03b5_k - \u03c9), which can be expressed as 1/(\u03b5_k - \u03c9 + i\u03b4) or similar.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function \\( G_0 \\) for a non-interacting system is determined by the single-particle energy eigenvalues \\( \\epsilon_k \\).
