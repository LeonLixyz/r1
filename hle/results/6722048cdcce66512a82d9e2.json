  "question": "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. What is the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G of type E_8 over F_q. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. A maximal torus in a reductive group over a finite field is an algebraic subgroup that becomes isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups over the algebraic closure. When we say an F_q-rational maximal torus, we probably mean a torus that is defined over F_q and maximal in that category.\n\nNow, the question is about counting these maximal tori. I remember that in finite groups of Lie type, the number of maximal tori can be related to the Weyl group. For example, in GL_n, the number of maximal tori (which are the conjugacy classes of diagonalizable subgroups) is related to the number of ways to decompose the space into cyclic subspaces under the Frobenius action. But E_8 is a more complicated group.\n\nWait, the Weyl group of E_8 is a specific finite Coxeter group. The order of the Weyl group for E_8 is known, right? Let me recall: the order of the Weyl group for type E_8 is 696729600. But how does this relate to counting maximal tori?\n\nI think the general formula for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group G is given by some formula involving the Weyl group. Maybe it's similar to the number of maximal tori being equal to the order of the Weyl group divided by something, but I need to check.\n\nWait, another approach: Maximal tori in G are all conjugate over the algebraic closure, but over F_q, they split into different conjugacy classes. The number of F_q-rational maximal tori can be computed using Deligne-Lusztig theory or through some formula involving characters, but perhaps there's a more straightforward count.\n\nAlternatively, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group might be related to the number of F_q-rational points of the variety of maximal tori. Wait, the variety of maximal tori is a homogeneous space under G, so maybe the number of F_q points can be calculated via Lang's theorem. But I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, there's a formula by Steinberg for the number of maximal tori. Let me recall. For a finite Lie group G(F_q), the number of maximal tori is equal to the sum over all w in the Weyl group W of (1 / |C_W(w)|), where C_W(w) is the centralizer of w in W, multiplied by q^{l(w)}, where l(w) is the length of w. Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's a generating function involving the Weyl group.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in the case of split groups, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is given by the formula (q^N (q - 1)^r) / |W|, where N is the number of positive roots and r is the rank. But wait, for E_8, the rank r is 8. The number of positive roots is 120 for E_8. So N=120. Then substituting, we get (q^{120}(q-1)^8)/|W|. But what's |W| for E_8? Earlier I thought it's 696729600. Let me confirm: E_8's Weyl group has order 696729600. So substituting that in, the formula would be (q^{120}(q - 1)^8)/696729600.\n\nBut wait, where did I get this formula from? Maybe I need to verify this. Let me think. If the group is split, then the number of maximal tori should involve the order of the Weyl group. For example, in the case of GL(n), the number of maximal tori (which are the split tori) is (q - 1)^n divided by the order of the Weyl group, which is n! But in GL(n), the number of split maximal tori is indeed (q - 1)(q - 2)...(q - n + 1) divided by n!? Wait, no. Wait, in GL(n), the split maximal tori are the conjugacy classes of diagonal matrices. The number of maximal split tori is 1, because all split maximal tori are conjugate. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, all split maximal tori in GL(n) are conjugate over F_q, so there's only one rational conjugacy class. But the count of actual tori (as subgroups) would be different. Wait, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, in the case where the group is split, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori can be calculated using the formula from a paper or textbook. For example, I recall that in Carter's book \"Finite Groups of Lie Type,\" there's discussion on maximal tori. Alternatively, the number of maximal tori is equal to the number of regular semisimple conjugacy classes, but maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of maximal tori in G(F_q) is equal to the number of F_q-stable conjugacy classes of maximal tori in G. Each such conjugacy class corresponds to a conjugacy class in the Weyl group under the action of Frobenius. But since the group is split, the Frobenius action is trivial, so the F_q-rational maximal tori correspond to the conjugacy classes in the Weyl group. Wait, but the number of F_q-rational maximal tori should be related to the number of tori that are defined over F_q, which in the split case are the split tori.\n\nWait, perhaps the split maximal tori are in bijection with the Weyl group. Wait, in a split group, all maximal split tori are conjugate. Wait, that contradicts. For example, in GL(n), all split maximal tori are conjugate. So there's only one split maximal torus up to conjugacy, but that's over the field. But perhaps when considering the actual count as subgroups, the number is larger. Wait, but how many maximal tori are there in GL(n,F_q)? Each maximal torus corresponds to a decomposition of the vector space into 1-dimensional subspaces, but since they are split, perhaps it's the number of ways to choose a basis, modulo the action of the Weyl group. Wait, the number of maximal split tori in GL(n,F_q) is equal to the number of ordered bases divided by the order of the Weyl group (n!), because the Weyl group acts by permuting the basis vectors. The number of ordered bases is (q-1)^n * q^{n(n-1)/2} }? Wait, that's the order of GL(n,F_q). Wait, no, the number of ordered bases is (q^n -1)(q^n - q)...(q^n - q^{n-1})). But that's the order of GL(n, F_q). But how to get the number of maximal split tori?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of maximal split tori is equal to |GL(n, F_q)| / (|T| * |W|), where T is a maximal split torus. For GL(n), T is (F_q^*)^n, so |T| is (q-1)^n. The Weyl group W is S_n with order n!. So the number of maximal split tori would be |GL(n, F_q)| / ((q-1)^n * n!) ). Which is [ (q^n -1)(q^n - q)...(q^{n} - q^{n-1}) ) ] / [ (q-1)^n * n! ) ]. But simplifying that, the numerator is q^{n(n-1)/2} (q-1)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 + q + ... + q^{i-1}) )? Not sure. But perhaps the formula is |G| divided by (|T| |W| ). If that's the case, then for general split reductive group G, the number of maximal split tori would be |G(F_q)| / (|T(F_q)| |W|).\n\nFor the group E_8, which is split, |G(F_q)| is the order of the Chevalley group E_8(q). The order of E_8(q) is q^120 (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)(q^12 -1)(q^14 -1)(q^18 -1)(q^20 -1)(q^24 -1)(q^30 -1). But that's a very big number. A maximal split torus T in E_8 has order (q -1)^8. The Weyl group has order |W| = 696729600. So if the formula is |G| / ( |T| |W| ), then the number of maximal split tori would be [ q^120 (q^2 -1)...(q^30 -1) ] / [ (q -1)^8 * 696729600 ) ]. But this seems way too complicated. Also, the question asks for the exact number, and this expression would involve factors that might cancel with the (q -1)^8 term. However, maybe there is a simplification.\n\nWait, but perhaps the answer is |W|, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe in the split case, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of F_q-rational points of the variety of maximal tori, which is G/N(T), where N(T) is the normalizer of a maximal torus. Since G is split, N(T)(F_q) is the normalizer of the split torus, which is T(F_q) \u22ca W. So the number of F_q points of G/N(T) is |G(F_q)| / |N(T)(F_q)| = |G| / ( |T| |W| ) as earlier. So this would be the number of maximal split tori in G(F_q). But the question is about reductive groups of type E8, which in this case is split, so maybe the answer is |G| / ( |T| |W| ).\n\nBut then, substituting the order of E8(q), which is q^120 times the product over i (q^{d_i} - 1), where d_i are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group. For E8, the degrees are 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30. So the order is q^120 (q^2 - 1)(q^8 - 1)(q^12 - 1)(q^14 -1)(q^18 -1)(q^20 -1)(q^24 -1)(q^30 -1). The maximal split torus T has order (q -1)^8. The normalizer N(T) has order |T| * |W| = (q-1)^8 * 696729600. Therefore, the number of maximal split tori would be |G| / ( (q-1)^8 * |W| ). Simplifying, the |G| / |T| is [ q^120 * product (q^{d_i} -1) ] / (q-1)^8.\n\nBut (q^{d_i} -1) can be factored as (q -1)(q^{d_i -1} + q^{d_i -2} + ... +1 ). So for each term in the product, (q^2 -1) = (q-1)(q+1), (q^8 -1) = (q-1)(q^7 + q^6 + ... +1 ), etc. Therefore, each (q^{d_i} -1) term contributes a factor of (q -1). So when we divide by (q-1)^8, each of the terms (q^{d_i} -1) in the product includes a (q -1) factor, and there are 8 such factors (since there are 8 terms in the product for E8's degrees). Therefore, dividing by (q-1)^8 cancels each (q-1) term in the product. So the |G| / |T| becomes q^120 multiplied by the product of (q +1), (q^7 + q^6 + ... +1 ), etc., for each degree.\n\nBut then, the number of maximal tori would be this product divided by |W|. But then, the exact number would be [ q^120 * (q+1)(q^7 + ... +1)... (q^{29} + ... +1) ] / |W|. But this seems like a very complicated expression, not an exact number. However, the question says \"the exact number\", so maybe there's a simplification here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.\n\nWait, another thought: In the split case, all maximal tori are isomorphic to (F_q^*)^8, but not necessarily split. Wait, no, in the split group, the maximal split tori are those which are split over F_q. But there might also be non-split maximal tori. Wait, but the question asks for F_q-rational maximal tori. So perhaps only the split ones, but that might not be the case. Wait, a maximal torus defined over F_q need not be split. For example, in SL_2, a maximal torus could be split (diagonal matrices) or nonsplit, like the norm 1 elements in a quadratic extension. But in that case, the torus is F_q-rational but not split.\n\nTherefore, the count of F_q-rational maximal tori includes both split and non-split tori, as long as they are defined over F_q. But how to count them? This might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group, multiplied by some factors. But I'm not sure. Wait, in Deligne-Lusztig theory, the number of maximal tori is related to the characters of the Weyl group. For each w in W, there is a torus T_w, and the number of F_q-rational tori is given by some formula.\n\nWait, Carter's book \"Finite Groups of Lie Type\" in Chapter 3 might have this. From memory, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group G is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of maximal tori = (1 / |W|) * \u03a3_{w \u2208 W} q^{l(w)}}\n\nwhere l(w) is the length of the element w in the Weyl group. But I'm not sure. Another possibility is that for each maximal torus, the number is related to the Euler totient function for the Weyl group. Wait, perhaps this is connected to the generating function of the Weyl group.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for each maximal torus T in G over F_q, the isomorphism class corresponds to a conjugacy class in the Weyl group. The number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of F-stable conjugacy classes in the Weyl group, where F is the Frobenius. But in the split case, the Frobenius acts trivially on the Weyl group, so the number is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in W.\n\nBut wait, in the split case, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of maximal F_q-tori, which is equal to the number of W-conjugacy classes. But I'm not sure. For example, in GL(n), the number of conjugacy classes of maximal tori is equal to the number of partitions of n, which corresponds to the conjugacy classes in the symmetric group W=S_n. But in that case, the maximal tori are products of multiplicative groups corresponding to the degrees of the field extensions in their decomposition. So the number of rational maximal tori is not the same as the number of conjugacy classes in W. So perhaps that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori might be given by the coefficient of the highest degree term in the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the Weyl group evaluated at q. For example, in type A_{n-1}, the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial is (q^n -1)/(q -1), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I found a reference in a paper by Kenneth Brown, \"The coset poset and Probabilistic Zeta function of a Finite Group,\" which mentions that the number of maximal tori in a finite Lie group of type W is |W|^{-1} \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i} -1)}, where d_i are the degrees of the basic invariants of W. Wait, for E8, the degrees are 2,8,12,14,18,20,24,30. So the product would be (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1). Divide by |W| which is 696729600. Then this would give the number of maximal tori. Wait, the order of the group G is q^{120} times the product of (q^{d_i} -1). So if the order of G is |G| = q^{120} (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1), then |G| divided by |W| times (q -1)^8 is the formula I mentioned earlier.\n\nWait, but Brown says that the number of maximal tori is (1/|W|) \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i} -1). For E8, this would be (1/696729600) * (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1). But since the rank r=8, but there are eight factors here. Wait, but the product over the degrees minus 1? Let me check for a smaller group. Take GL(n). The degrees of W=S_n are 2,3,...,n. So the product would be (q^2 -1)(q^3 -1)...(q^n -1). Divided by |W|=n!.\n\nBut in GL(n), the number of maximal tori is given by the number of ways to decompose the space into cyclic subspaces under a regular semisimple element. However, I'm not sure if this matches with Brown's formula. For example, in GL(2), the formula would be (q^2 -1)(q^3 -1)/2! Wait, but GL(2) has order q(q-1)(q^2 -1). Wait, no. For GL(2), |G| = (q^2 -1)(q^2 - q) = q(q-1)(q^2 -1). The product of (q^2 -1) (q^3 -1) isn't relevant here, so maybe Brown is talking about something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. If the number of maximal tori in G(F_q) is equal to the number of regular semisimple conjugacy classes, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the original problem: the group is of type E8, and the question is about the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori. If the group is split (which is the usual assumption if not stated otherwise), then the number is given by the formula from Carter's book or other sources.\n\nI found a paper by Fulman and Guralnick which states that the number of maximal tori in a finite group of Lie type is equal to (q^N (q - 1)^r)/|W|, where N is the number of positive roots, r is the rank. For E8, N=120, r=8. So substituting, we get (q^{120} (q - 1)^8)/|W|. Since |W(E8)|=696729600, the number is (q^{120} (q-1)^8)/696729600.\n\nBut wait, the order of the group G is given by q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i} - 1), where d_i are the degrees. For E8, the degrees are 2,8,12,14,18,20,24,30, so the product is (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1). Then the formula (q^{120} (q -1)^8)/|W| would not account for all these factors. Hence, this must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of maximal tori is equal to |G| / (|T| |W|), where T is a maximal split torus. Since |T| = (q - 1)^r = (q -1)^8. Then |G| / ( |T| |W| ) = [q^{120} (q^2 -1)...(q^30 -1) ] / [ (q -1)^8 * 696729600 ) ].\n\nBut note that in the product (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1), each term can be factored as (q -1) times something. For example, q^2 -1 = (q -1)(q +1), q^8 -1 = (q -1)(q^7 + q^6 + ... +1), and so on. Each of the eight factors (since there are eight degrees) would contribute a (q -1) term, so when we divide by (q -1)^8, we cancel these terms. Then the remaining product would be (q +1)(q^7 + q^6 + ... +1)(q^{11} + ... +1)...(q^{29} + ... +1). So the number of maximal tori would be [ q^{120} times this remaining product ] divided by |W|. But this seems complicated. However, if all these remaining terms when expanded give polynomials in q, then perhaps this is the exact number.\n\nBut the question asks for the exact number. Given that the problem is about E8, which has a specific Weyl group, and that the answer might be a simple formula involving |W|, the answer is likely (q^{120} (q - 1)^8)/|W|, but given that the product in |G| includes more factors than just (q -1)^8, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. There's a theorem that says that the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group is equal to the product over (q^{d_i} - 1) divided by |W|, where d_i are the degrees of the Weyl group. For example, in GL(n), this would be the product from i=1 to n of (q^i -1)/n! , but I don't recall that being correct. Alternatively, perhaps the number is equal to the product over (q^{d_i} -1) divided by |W|. For E8, this would be (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1)/696729600. But does that make sense?\n\nBut in GL(n), the number of maximal tori would be (q -1)(q^2 -1)...(q^n -1)/n! , which might be correct. For example, in GL(2), that would be (q -1)(q^2 -1)/2. Let's check with q=2: then (1)(3)/2 = 1.5, which doesn't make sense. So that's not right. Hence, my assumption must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, in the case of E8, maybe the number is equal to the order of the group divided by the order of the normalizer of a maximal torus. Since the normalizer N(T) is T \u22ca W, then |N(T)| = |T| * |W|. So |G| / |N(T)| is |G| / (|T| |W| ). But in E8 split, |T| = (q -1)^8. So this would again lead to the formula we had before.\n\nBut then, perhaps this is indeed the formula. Then the answer would be |E8(q)| divided by ( (q-1)^8 * 696729600 ). But |E8(q)| is q^{120} (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)(q^{12}-1)...(q^{30}-1), so dividing by (q -1)^8 cancels each (q -1) factor in the terms (q^2 -1), (q^8 -1), etc. For example, (q^2 -1) = (q -1)(q +1), so after dividing by (q -1)^8, we get (q +1) for the q^2 -1 term, (q^7 + q^6 + ... +1) for the q^8 -1 term, and so on. Multiplying all these remaining terms and q^{120} together and dividing by |W| gives the number of maximal tori. But this expression would be a polynomial in q, but the question asks for the exact number. Unless there's a simplification where all those factors multiply to (q^{120} (q -1)^8), but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me look up a source. In the book \"Representation Theory of Finite Reductive Groups\" by Cabanes and Enguehard, it's stated that the number of F-stable maximal tori in a connected reductive group G is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W. For split groups, since F acts trivially on W, the number of F-conjugacy classes is the number of conjugacy classes of W. However, this counts the number of G^F-conjugacy classes of F-stable maximal tori. But each F-stable maximal torus which is defined over F_q is counted here. But the actual number of F_q-rational maximal tori would be different, since tori can be non-split.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the sum over w in W of some terms. In particular, using the formula from a paper by Digne and Michel, the number of maximal tori in G(F_q) is given by the number of geometric tori fixed by Frobenius, which corresponds to the number of w in W such that F(T_w) = T_w. But in the split case, all tori are F-stable, so the number of F-stable maximal tori is equal to the number of elements in the Weyl group modulo some relation. No, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, in the split case, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of F_q-conjugacy classes of maximal tori. But according to a theorem by Steinberg, in a split group, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of regular semisimple elements divided by the order of the torus. But that might not help directly.\n\nWait, stepping back, the user is asking for the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori in G, which is of type E8. Given that this is a specific group, maybe the answer is known to be (q - 1)^8 multiplied by something over |W|. But considering that in the case of GL(n), the number of maximal tori is the same as the number of diagonalizable subgroups, which is given by (q - 1)^n divided by n! but in reality, for GL(n), all maximal tori are conjugate to the diagonal matrices over the algebraic closure, but over F_q, there are more. Wait, no, in GL(n), the split maximal tori are all conjugate over F_q, but there are non-split tori as well. For example, in GL(2), there is the split torus F_q^* \u00d7 F_q^*, and there are non-split tori coming from quadratic extensions.\n\nBut the question is about maximal tori that are defined over F_q. Even if they are non-split, as long as they are defined over F_q, they are counted. So the count includes both split and non-split F_q-rational tori. But how to compute this?\n\nLooking back, I found a paper by Deriziotis, \"The number of rational maximal tori in a reductive group\", but I can't access it now. However, based on knowledge snippets, there's a formula involving the Weyl group and the action of Frobenius. For a split group, the Frobenius action is trivial, so perhaps the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of elements in the Weyl group, divided by something. But I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula from the theory of finite reductive groups: the number of maximal tori in G(F_q) is given by the sum over all w in W of q^{l(w)}, divided by |W|. Wait, this is from a formula by Steinberg for the number of elements in the group. Wait, the number of maximal tori might be related to the number of Borel subgroups. For example, the number of Borel subgroups in G(F_q) is |G| / |B|, where B is a Borel subgroup. But maximal tori are more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for a finite group of Lie type, the number of maximal tori is equal to the product of (1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^{d_i - 1}) for each degree d_i of the Weyl group, divided by the order of the Weyl group. For E8, the degrees are 2,8,12,14,18,20,24,30, so the product would be (1 + q)(1 + q + ... + q^7)(... up to q^{29})). But this would be a very high-degree polynomial. Alternatively, the product of (q^{d_i} - 1) / (q - 1) for each degree d_i, divided by |W|. This would give ((q^2 -1)/(q -1)) * ((q^8 -1)/(q -1)) * ... * ((q^30 -1)/(q -1)) / |W|. Which simplifies to [ (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1) ] / ( (q -1)^8 |W| ). Which is the same as [ (q^{120} (q^2 -1)...(q^30 -1) ) / (q^{120} (q-1)^8 |W| ) ) ]? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the order of G is q^{120} times (q^2-1)...(q^30-1). So if the number of maximal tori is |G| / ( |T| |W| ), then it's [ q^{120} (q^2-1)...(q^30-1) ] / [ (q-1)^8 |W| ) ].\n\nBut this expression is complicated, but the problem asks for the exact number, and given that E8's Weyl group order is known, perhaps this is the answer. Therefore, the exact number is:\n\n(q^{120} (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)) / ( (q -1)^8 * 696729600 )\n\nSimplifying each term (q^{d_i} -1) = (q -1)(q^{d_i-1} + ... +1), so:\n\n(q^{120} * (q -1)^8 * (q +1)(q^7 + ... +1)...(q^{29} + ... +1)) / ( (q -1)^8 * 696729600 )\n\nThe (q -1)^8 terms cancel out, so we get:\n\n(q^{120} * (q +1)(q^7 + q^6 + ... +1)...(q^{29} + ... +1)) / 696729600\n\nThis is the simplified form, but it's a product of several polynomials. However, the problem states \"the exact number\", which implies that this formula is the answer exactly as written. But the answer format expects a box around the answer, so perhaps this is it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler expression. For example, in the case of E8, perhaps the product of those terms (q +1)(q^7 + ... +1)... is equal to the product (q^d_i -1)/(q -1) for each degree d_i. This product could be written as the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the Weyl group.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G of type E_8 over F_q. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. A maximal torus in a reductive group over a finite field is an algebraic subgroup that becomes isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups over the algebraic closure. When we say an F_q-rational maximal torus, we probably mean a torus that is defined over F_q and maximal in that category.\n\nNow, the question is about counting these maximal tori. I remember that in finite groups of Lie type, the number of maximal tori can be related to the Weyl group. For example, in GL_n, the number of maximal tori (which are the conjugacy classes of diagonalizable subgroups) is related to the number of ways to decompose the space into cyclic subspaces under the Frobenius action. But E_8 is a more complicated group.\n\nWait, the Weyl group of E_8 is a specific finite Coxeter group. The order of the Weyl group for E_8 is known, right? Let me recall: the order of the Weyl group for type E_8 is 696729600. But how does this relate to counting maximal tori?\n\nI think the general formula for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group G is given by some formula involving the Weyl group. Maybe it's similar to the number of maximal tori being equal to the order of the Weyl group divided by something, but I need to check.\n\nWait, another approach: Maximal tori in G are all conjugate over the algebraic closure, but over F_q, they split into different conjugacy classes. The number of F_q-rational maximal tori can be computed using Deligne-Lusztig theory or through some formula involving characters, but perhaps there's a more straightforward count.\n\nAlternatively, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group might be related to the number of F_q-rational points of the variety of maximal tori. Wait, the variety of maximal tori is a homogeneous space under G, so maybe the number of F_q points can be calculated via Lang's theorem. But I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, there's a formula by Steinberg for the number of maximal tori. Let me recall. For a finite Lie group G(F_q), the number of maximal tori is equal to the sum over all w in the Weyl group W of (1 / |C_W(w)|), where C_W(w) is the centralizer of w in W, multiplied by q^{l(w)}, where l(w) is the length of w. Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's a generating function involving the Weyl group.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in the case of split groups, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is given by the formula (q^N (q - 1)^r) / |W|, where N is the number of positive roots and r is the rank. But wait, for E_8, the rank r is 8. The number of positive roots is 120 for E_8. So N=120. Then substituting, we get (q^{120}(q-1)^8)/|W|. But what's |W| for E_8? Earlier I thought it's 696729600. Let me confirm: E_8's Weyl group has order 696729600. So substituting that in, the formula would be (q^{120}(q - 1)^8)/696729600.\n\nBut wait, where did I get this formula from? Maybe I need to verify this. Let me think. If the group is split, then the number of maximal tori should involve the order of the Weyl group. For example, in the case of GL(n), the number of maximal tori (which are the split tori) is (q - 1)^n divided by the order of the Weyl group, which is n! But in GL(n), the number of split maximal tori is indeed (q - 1)(q - 2)...(q - n + 1) divided by n!? Wait, no. Wait, in GL(n), the split maximal tori are the conjugacy classes of diagonal matrices. The number of maximal split tori is 1, because all split maximal tori are conjugate. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, all split maximal tori in GL(n) are conjugate over F_q, so there's only one rational conjugacy class. But the count of actual tori (as subgroups) would be different. Wait, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, in the case where the group is split, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori can be calculated using the formula from a paper or textbook. For example, I recall that in Carter's book \"Finite Groups of Lie Type,\" there's discussion on maximal tori. Alternatively, the number of maximal tori is equal to the number of regular semisimple conjugacy classes, but maybe that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of maximal tori in G(F_q) is equal to the number of F_q-stable conjugacy classes of maximal tori in G. Each such conjugacy class corresponds to a conjugacy class in the Weyl group under the action of Frobenius. But since the group is split, the Frobenius action is trivial, so the F_q-rational maximal tori correspond to the conjugacy classes in the Weyl group. Wait, but the number of F_q-rational maximal tori should be related to the number of tori that are defined over F_q, which in the split case are the split tori.\n\nWait, perhaps the split maximal tori are in bijection with the Weyl group. Wait, in a split group, all maximal split tori are conjugate. Wait, that contradicts. For example, in GL(n), all split maximal tori are conjugate. So there's only one split maximal torus up to conjugacy, but that's over the field. But perhaps when considering the actual count as subgroups, the number is larger. Wait, but how many maximal tori are there in GL(n,F_q)? Each maximal torus corresponds to a decomposition of the vector space into 1-dimensional subspaces, but since they are split, perhaps it's the number of ways to choose a basis, modulo the action of the Weyl group. Wait, the number of maximal split tori in GL(n,F_q) is equal to the number of ordered bases divided by the order of the Weyl group (n!), because the Weyl group acts by permuting the basis vectors. The number of ordered bases is (q-1)^n * q^{n(n-1)/2} }? Wait, that's the order of GL(n,F_q). Wait, no, the number of ordered bases is (q^n -1)(q^n - q)...(q^n - q^{n-1})). But that's the order of GL(n, F_q). But how to get the number of maximal split tori?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of maximal split tori is equal to |GL(n, F_q)| / (|T| * |W|), where T is a maximal split torus. For GL(n), T is (F_q^*)^n, so |T| is (q-1)^n. The Weyl group W is S_n with order n!. So the number of maximal split tori would be |GL(n, F_q)| / ((q-1)^n * n!) ). Which is [ (q^n -1)(q^n - q)...(q^{n} - q^{n-1}) ) ] / [ (q-1)^n * n! ) ]. But simplifying that, the numerator is q^{n(n-1)/2} (q-1)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 + q + ... + q^{i-1}) )? Not sure. But perhaps the formula is |G| divided by (|T| |W| ). If that's the case, then for general split reductive group G, the number of maximal split tori would be |G(F_q)| / (|T(F_q)| |W|).\n\nFor the group E_8, which is split, |G(F_q)| is the order of the Chevalley group E_8(q). The order of E_8(q) is q^120 (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)(q^12 -1)(q^14 -1)(q^18 -1)(q^20 -1)(q^24 -1)(q^30 -1). But that's a very big number. A maximal split torus T in E_8 has order (q -1)^8. The Weyl group has order |W| = 696729600. So if the formula is |G| / ( |T| |W| ), then the number of maximal split tori would be [ q^120 (q^2 -1)...(q^30 -1) ] / [ (q -1)^8 * 696729600 ) ]. But this seems way too complicated. Also, the question asks for the exact number, and this expression would involve factors that might cancel with the (q -1)^8 term. However, maybe there is a simplification.\n\nWait, but perhaps the answer is |W|, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe in the split case, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of F_q-rational points of the variety of maximal tori, which is G/N(T), where N(T) is the normalizer of a maximal torus. Since G is split, N(T)(F_q) is the normalizer of the split torus, which is T(F_q) \u22ca W. So the number of F_q points of G/N(T) is |G(F_q)| / |N(T)(F_q)| = |G| / ( |T| |W| ) as earlier. So this would be the number of maximal split tori in G(F_q). But the question is about reductive groups of type E8, which in this case is split, so maybe the answer is |G| / ( |T| |W| ).\n\nBut then, substituting the order of E8(q), which is q^120 times the product over i (q^{d_i} - 1), where d_i are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group. For E8, the degrees are 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30. So the order is q^120 (q^2 - 1)(q^8 - 1)(q^12 - 1)(q^14 -1)(q^18 -1)(q^20 -1)(q^24 -1)(q^30 -1). The maximal split torus T has order (q -1)^8. The normalizer N(T) has order |T| * |W| = (q-1)^8 * 696729600. Therefore, the number of maximal split tori would be |G| / ( (q-1)^8 * |W| ). Simplifying, the |G| / |T| is [ q^120 * product (q^{d_i} -1) ] / (q-1)^8.\n\nBut (q^{d_i} -1) can be factored as (q -1)(q^{d_i -1} + q^{d_i -2} + ... +1 ). So for each term in the product, (q^2 -1) = (q-1)(q+1), (q^8 -1) = (q-1)(q^7 + q^6 + ... +1 ), etc. Therefore, each (q^{d_i} -1) term contributes a factor of (q -1). So when we divide by (q-1)^8, each of the terms (q^{d_i} -1) in the product includes a (q -1) factor, and there are 8 such factors (since there are 8 terms in the product for E8's degrees). Therefore, dividing by (q-1)^8 cancels each (q-1) term in the product. So the |G| / |T| becomes q^120 multiplied by the product of (q +1), (q^7 + q^6 + ... +1 ), etc., for each degree.\n\nBut then, the number of maximal tori would be this product divided by |W|. But then, the exact number would be [ q^120 * (q+1)(q^7 + ... +1)... (q^{29} + ... +1) ] / |W|. But this seems like a very complicated expression, not an exact number. However, the question says \"the exact number\", so maybe there's a simplification here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.\n\nWait, another thought: In the split case, all maximal tori are isomorphic to (F_q^*)^8, but not necessarily split. Wait, no, in the split group, the maximal split tori are those which are split over F_q. But there might also be non-split maximal tori. Wait, but the question asks for F_q-rational maximal tori. So perhaps only the split ones, but that might not be the case. Wait, a maximal torus defined over F_q need not be split. For example, in SL_2, a maximal torus could be split (diagonal matrices) or nonsplit, like the norm 1 elements in a quadratic extension. But in that case, the torus is F_q-rational but not split.\n\nTherefore, the count of F_q-rational maximal tori includes both split and non-split tori, as long as they are defined over F_q. But how to count them? This might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group, multiplied by some factors. But I'm not sure. Wait, in Deligne-Lusztig theory, the number of maximal tori is related to the characters of the Weyl group. For each w in W, there is a torus T_w, and the number of F_q-rational tori is given by some formula.\n\nWait, Carter's book \"Finite Groups of Lie Type\" in Chapter 3 might have this. From memory, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group G is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of maximal tori = (1 / |W|) * \u03a3_{w \u2208 W} q^{l(w)}}\n\nwhere l(w) is the length of the element w in the Weyl group. But I'm not sure. Another possibility is that for each maximal torus, the number is related to the Euler totient function for the Weyl group. Wait, perhaps this is connected to the generating function of the Weyl group.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for each maximal torus T in G over F_q, the isomorphism class corresponds to a conjugacy class in the Weyl group. The number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of F-stable conjugacy classes in the Weyl group, where F is the Frobenius. But in the split case, the Frobenius acts trivially on the Weyl group, so the number is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in W.\n\nBut wait, in the split case, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of maximal F_q-tori, which is equal to the number of W-conjugacy classes. But I'm not sure. For example, in GL(n), the number of conjugacy classes of maximal tori is equal to the number of partitions of n, which corresponds to the conjugacy classes in the symmetric group W=S_n. But in that case, the maximal tori are products of multiplicative groups corresponding to the degrees of the field extensions in their decomposition. So the number of rational maximal tori is not the same as the number of conjugacy classes in W. So perhaps that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori might be given by the coefficient of the highest degree term in the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the Weyl group evaluated at q. For example, in type A_{n-1}, the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial is (q^n -1)/(q -1), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I found a reference in a paper by Kenneth Brown, \"The coset poset and Probabilistic Zeta function of a Finite Group,\" which mentions that the number of maximal tori in a finite Lie group of type W is |W|^{-1} \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i} -1)}, where d_i are the degrees of the basic invariants of W. Wait, for E8, the degrees are 2,8,12,14,18,20,24,30. So the product would be (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1). Divide by |W| which is 696729600. Then this would give the number of maximal tori. Wait, the order of the group G is q^{120} times the product of (q^{d_i} -1). So if the order of G is |G| = q^{120} (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1), then |G| divided by |W| times (q -1)^8 is the formula I mentioned earlier.\n\nWait, but Brown says that the number of maximal tori is (1/|W|) \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i} -1). For E8, this would be (1/696729600) * (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1). But since the rank r=8, but there are eight factors here. Wait, but the product over the degrees minus 1? Let me check for a smaller group. Take GL(n). The degrees of W=S_n are 2,3,...,n. So the product would be (q^2 -1)(q^3 -1)...(q^n -1). Divided by |W|=n!.\n\nBut in GL(n), the number of maximal tori is given by the number of ways to decompose the space into cyclic subspaces under a regular semisimple element. However, I'm not sure if this matches with Brown's formula. For example, in GL(2), the formula would be (q^2 -1)(q^3 -1)/2! Wait, but GL(2) has order q(q-1)(q^2 -1). Wait, no. For GL(2), |G| = (q^2 -1)(q^2 - q) = q(q-1)(q^2 -1). The product of (q^2 -1) (q^3 -1) isn't relevant here, so maybe Brown is talking about something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. If the number of maximal tori in G(F_q) is equal to the number of regular semisimple conjugacy classes, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the original problem: the group is of type E8, and the question is about the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori. If the group is split (which is the usual assumption if not stated otherwise), then the number is given by the formula from Carter's book or other sources.\n\nI found a paper by Fulman and Guralnick which states that the number of maximal tori in a finite group of Lie type is equal to (q^N (q - 1)^r)/|W|, where N is the number of positive roots, r is the rank. For E8, N=120, r=8. So substituting, we get (q^{120} (q - 1)^8)/|W|. Since |W(E8)|=696729600, the number is (q^{120} (q-1)^8)/696729600.\n\nBut wait, the order of the group G is given by q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i} - 1), where d_i are the degrees. For E8, the degrees are 2,8,12,14,18,20,24,30, so the product is (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1). Then the formula (q^{120} (q -1)^8)/|W| would not account for all these factors. Hence, this must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of maximal tori is equal to |G| / (|T| |W|), where T is a maximal split torus. Since |T| = (q - 1)^r = (q -1)^8. Then |G| / ( |T| |W| ) = [q^{120} (q^2 -1)...(q^30 -1) ] / [ (q -1)^8 * 696729600 ) ].\n\nBut note that in the product (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1), each term can be factored as (q -1) times something. For example, q^2 -1 = (q -1)(q +1), q^8 -1 = (q -1)(q^7 + q^6 + ... +1), and so on. Each of the eight factors (since there are eight degrees) would contribute a (q -1) term, so when we divide by (q -1)^8, we cancel these terms. Then the remaining product would be (q +1)(q^7 + q^6 + ... +1)(q^{11} + ... +1)...(q^{29} + ... +1). So the number of maximal tori would be [ q^{120} times this remaining product ] divided by |W|. But this seems complicated. However, if all these remaining terms when expanded give polynomials in q, then perhaps this is the exact number.\n\nBut the question asks for the exact number. Given that the problem is about E8, which has a specific Weyl group, and that the answer might be a simple formula involving |W|, the answer is likely (q^{120} (q - 1)^8)/|W|, but given that the product in |G| includes more factors than just (q -1)^8, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. There's a theorem that says that the number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group is equal to the product over (q^{d_i} - 1) divided by |W|, where d_i are the degrees of the Weyl group. For example, in GL(n), this would be the product from i=1 to n of (q^i -1)/n! , but I don't recall that being correct. Alternatively, perhaps the number is equal to the product over (q^{d_i} -1) divided by |W|. For E8, this would be (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1)/696729600. But does that make sense?\n\nBut in GL(n), the number of maximal tori would be (q -1)(q^2 -1)...(q^n -1)/n! , which might be correct. For example, in GL(2), that would be (q -1)(q^2 -1)/2. Let's check with q=2: then (1)(3)/2 = 1.5, which doesn't make sense. So that's not right. Hence, my assumption must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, in the case of E8, maybe the number is equal to the order of the group divided by the order of the normalizer of a maximal torus. Since the normalizer N(T) is T \u22ca W, then |N(T)| = |T| * |W|. So |G| / |N(T)| is |G| / (|T| |W| ). But in E8 split, |T| = (q -1)^8. So this would again lead to the formula we had before.\n\nBut then, perhaps this is indeed the formula. Then the answer would be |E8(q)| divided by ( (q-1)^8 * 696729600 ). But |E8(q)| is q^{120} (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)(q^{12}-1)...(q^{30}-1), so dividing by (q -1)^8 cancels each (q -1) factor in the terms (q^2 -1), (q^8 -1), etc. For example, (q^2 -1) = (q -1)(q +1), so after dividing by (q -1)^8, we get (q +1) for the q^2 -1 term, (q^7 + q^6 + ... +1) for the q^8 -1 term, and so on. Multiplying all these remaining terms and q^{120} together and dividing by |W| gives the number of maximal tori. But this expression would be a polynomial in q, but the question asks for the exact number. Unless there's a simplification where all those factors multiply to (q^{120} (q -1)^8), but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me look up a source. In the book \"Representation Theory of Finite Reductive Groups\" by Cabanes and Enguehard, it's stated that the number of F-stable maximal tori in a connected reductive group G is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W. For split groups, since F acts trivially on W, the number of F-conjugacy classes is the number of conjugacy classes of W. However, this counts the number of G^F-conjugacy classes of F-stable maximal tori. But each F-stable maximal torus which is defined over F_q is counted here. But the actual number of F_q-rational maximal tori would be different, since tori can be non-split.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the sum over w in W of some terms. In particular, using the formula from a paper by Digne and Michel, the number of maximal tori in G(F_q) is given by the number of geometric tori fixed by Frobenius, which corresponds to the number of w in W such that F(T_w) = T_w. But in the split case, all tori are F-stable, so the number of F-stable maximal tori is equal to the number of elements in the Weyl group modulo some relation. No, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, in the split case, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of F_q-conjugacy classes of maximal tori. But according to a theorem by Steinberg, in a split group, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of regular semisimple elements divided by the order of the torus. But that might not help directly.\n\nWait, stepping back, the user is asking for the exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori in G, which is of type E8. Given that this is a specific group, maybe the answer is known to be (q - 1)^8 multiplied by something over |W|. But considering that in the case of GL(n), the number of maximal tori is the same as the number of diagonalizable subgroups, which is given by (q - 1)^n divided by n! but in reality, for GL(n), all maximal tori are conjugate to the diagonal matrices over the algebraic closure, but over F_q, there are more. Wait, no, in GL(n), the split maximal tori are all conjugate over F_q, but there are non-split tori as well. For example, in GL(2), there is the split torus F_q^* \u00d7 F_q^*, and there are non-split tori coming from quadratic extensions.\n\nBut the question is about maximal tori that are defined over F_q. Even if they are non-split, as long as they are defined over F_q, they are counted. So the count includes both split and non-split F_q-rational tori. But how to compute this?\n\nLooking back, I found a paper by Deriziotis, \"The number of rational maximal tori in a reductive group\", but I can't access it now. However, based on knowledge snippets, there's a formula involving the Weyl group and the action of Frobenius. For a split group, the Frobenius action is trivial, so perhaps the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of elements in the Weyl group, divided by something. But I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula from the theory of finite reductive groups: the number of maximal tori in G(F_q) is given by the sum over all w in W of q^{l(w)}, divided by |W|. Wait, this is from a formula by Steinberg for the number of elements in the group. Wait, the number of maximal tori might be related to the number of Borel subgroups. For example, the number of Borel subgroups in G(F_q) is |G| / |B|, where B is a Borel subgroup. But maximal tori are more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for a finite group of Lie type, the number of maximal tori is equal to the product of (1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^{d_i - 1}) for each degree d_i of the Weyl group, divided by the order of the Weyl group. For E8, the degrees are 2,8,12,14,18,20,24,30, so the product would be (1 + q)(1 + q + ... + q^7)(... up to q^{29})). But this would be a very high-degree polynomial. Alternatively, the product of (q^{d_i} - 1) / (q - 1) for each degree d_i, divided by |W|. This would give ((q^2 -1)/(q -1)) * ((q^8 -1)/(q -1)) * ... * ((q^30 -1)/(q -1)) / |W|. Which simplifies to [ (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^30 -1) ] / ( (q -1)^8 |W| ). Which is the same as [ (q^{120} (q^2 -1)...(q^30 -1) ) / (q^{120} (q-1)^8 |W| ) ) ]? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the order of G is q^{120} times (q^2-1)...(q^30-1). So if the number of maximal tori is |G| / ( |T| |W| ), then it's [ q^{120} (q^2-1)...(q^30-1) ] / [ (q-1)^8 |W| ) ].\n\nBut this expression is complicated, but the problem asks for the exact number, and given that E8's Weyl group order is known, perhaps this is the answer. Therefore, the exact number is:\n\n(q^{120} (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)) / ( (q -1)^8 * 696729600 )\n\nSimplifying each term (q^{d_i} -1) = (q -1)(q^{d_i-1} + ... +1), so:\n\n(q^{120} * (q -1)^8 * (q +1)(q^7 + ... +1)...(q^{29} + ... +1)) / ( (q -1)^8 * 696729600 )\n\nThe (q -1)^8 terms cancel out, so we get:\n\n(q^{120} * (q +1)(q^7 + q^6 + ... +1)...(q^{29} + ... +1)) / 696729600\n\nThis is the simplified form, but it's a product of several polynomials. However, the problem states \"the exact number\", which implies that this formula is the answer exactly as written. But the answer format expects a box around the answer, so perhaps this is it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler expression. For example, in the case of E8, perhaps the product of those terms (q +1)(q^7 + ... +1)... is equal to the product (q^d_i -1)/(q -1) for each degree d_i. This product could be written as the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the Weyl group. But I'm not sure. \n\nBut given that the question is asking for the exact number and given the options, the answer is likely the formula involving the product of (q^{d_i} -1) divided by |W| times (q-1)^8. But after simplification, the final answer is [ (q^{120} (q^2 -1)(q^8 -1)...(q^{30} -1) ) ] / [ (q -1)^8 * |W| ) ] which simplifies to [ q^{120} * (q +1)(q^7 + ... +1)...(q^{29} + ... +1) ] / |W|. But since this is a specific formula, and given that the problem says \"exact number\", this must be the correct answer.",
