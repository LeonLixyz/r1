  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I have this problem about a steel bar that's tapering, and I need to find its elongation when a tensile force is applied. Hmm. The bar has a uniform thickness of 2 cm, and it tapers from 1.5 cm to 7.5 cm over a length of 50 cm. The force is 100 kN, and the modulus of elasticity E is given as 2e5 N/mm\u00b2. The answer needs to be in mm. \n\nFirst, I remember that for axially loaded members, the elongation can be calculated using the formula \u0394L = (P * L) / (A * E), but that's when the cross-sectional area A is constant. But in this case, the bar is tapered, so the area varies along the length. That means the simple formula won't work here. Instead, I think I need to use integration over the length since each infinitesimal segment will have a different area.\n\nThe bar is of uniform thickness, 2 cm. Wait, the thickness is 2 cm, and the width tapers from 1.5 cm to 7.5 cm. So the cross-sectional area at any point would be the width times the thickness. Since thickness is constant, the area varies linearly from the narrow end to the wider end. Let me visualize this. The bar is 50 cm long (which is 500 mm), and at one end (let's say end A), the width is 1.5 cm (15 mm), and at end B, it's 7.5 cm (75 mm). The thickness is 2 cm (20 mm). So the cross-sectional area at A is 15 mm * 20 mm = 300 mm\u00b2, and at B, it's 75 mm * 20 mm = 1500 mm\u00b2. \n\nSince the bar tapers uniformly, the width increases linearly along the length. Let me define the x-axis along the length of the bar, with x=0 at end A (narrow end) and x=500 mm at end B. At any position x, the width w(x) can be expressed as a linear function. The rate of increase in width per unit length is (75 mm - 15 mm)/500 mm = 60 mm / 500 mm = 0.12 mm per mm of length. So the width as a function of x is w(x) = 15 mm + 0.12x (where x is in mm). \n\nBut wait, actually, let me check that. At x=0, width is 15 mm, and at x=500 mm, width is 75 mm. So the slope is (75-15)/500 = 60/500 = 0.12 mm/mm. So yes, the equation is correct: w(x) = 15 + 0.12x (mm). Then the area A(x) is width * thickness, which is w(x) * 20 mm. So A(x) = 20*(15 + 0.12x) = 300 + 2.4x mm\u00b2.\n\nNow, the formula for elongation when the area varies along the length is an integral from 0 to L of (P dx)/(A(x) E). Since the force P is axial and constant along the length (assuming static equilibrium and no other forces), that's 100 kN, which is 100,000 N. E is 2e5 N/mm\u00b2. So putting it all together:\n\n\u0394L = integral from 0 to 500 mm [ (100,000 N) / (A(x) * 2e5 N/mm\u00b2) ) dx ]\n\nFirst, let's write that out. Let's substitute A(x):\n\n\u0394L = \u222b (100,000) / [ (300 + 2.4x) * 2e5 ] dx from 0 to 500.\n\nSimplify the constants. 100,000 / 2e5 = 100,000 / 200,000 = 0.5. So:\n\n\u0394L = 0.5 \u222b [1 / (300 + 2.4x)] dx from 0 to 500.\n\nLet me compute this integral. The integral of 1/(a + bx) dx is (1/b) ln(a + bx) + C. So here, a=300, b=2.4.\n\nSo the integral becomes 0.5 * [ (1/2.4) * ln(300 + 2.4x) ) ] evaluated from 0 to 500.\n\nCompute the definite integral:\n\nAt upper limit (500):\n\nln(300 + 2.4*500) = ln(300 + 1200) = ln(1500)\n\nAt lower limit (0):\n\nln(300 + 0) = ln(300)\n\nSo the integral value is 0.5 * (1/2.4) [ ln(1500) - ln(300) ] = (0.5 / 2.4) * ln(1500/300) = (0.5 / 2.4) * ln(5)\n\nCalculate ln(5) \u2248 1.6094.\n\nSo now:\n\n0.5 / 2.4 = 1/(4.8) \u2248 0.208333...\n\nMultiply that by 1.6094: 0.208333 * 1.6094 \u2248 0.3358.\n\nSo \u0394L \u2248 0.3358 mm.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify each part.\n\nFirst, converting all units correctly. The length is 50 cm = 500 mm. The widths are in cm converted to mm: 1.5 cm is 15 mm, 7.5 cm is 75 mm. Thickness is 2 cm = 20 mm. So the area at any point is width (mm) * 20 mm. The modulus E is given as 2e5 N/mm\u00b2, which is correct. The force is 100 kN = 1e5 N. \n\nThe integral setup seems correct. The integral of 1/(a + bx) dx is indeed (1/b) ln(a +bx). \n\nWait, let me recheck the integral calculation:\n\nIntegral from 0 to 500 of [1/(300 + 2.4x)] dx.\n\nLet u = 300 + 2.4x. Then du = 2.4 dx \u2192 dx = du/2.4.\n\nLimits: when x=0, u=300; x=500, u=300 + 2.4*500 = 300 + 1200 = 1500.\n\nSo integral becomes (1/2.4) \u222b from u=300 to 1500 (1/u) du = (1/2.4)(ln 1500 - ln 300) = (1/2.4) ln(5) \u2248 (1/2.4)*1.6094 \u2248 0.6706. Then multiply by 0.5 (from the earlier 0.5 factor):\n\n0.5 * 0.6706 \u2248 0.3353 mm. So about 0.335 mm. But let's check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait, the 0.5 comes from 100,000/(2e5) = 0.5. Then the integral is 0.5 * [ (1/2.4)(ln(1500) - ln(300)) ].\n\nSo 0.5 * (1/2.4) is 1/(4.8) \u2248 0.20833. Multiply by ln(5) \u22481.6094: 0.20833 *1.6094\u22480.3358. So yes, approximately 0.3358 mm. So the elongation is about 0.336 mm. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm the direction of the taper. The question says the bar tapers uniformly from 1.5 cm to 7.5 cm. So which end is which? If the bar is AB, then perhaps A is the narrow end (1.5 cm) and B is the wider end (7.5 cm). But when we applied the force axially, the area increases from A to B. The formula is correct as set up because we considered x from 0 (A) to 500 mm (B). \n\nBut in the original problem statement, it's a tensile force. Since the bar is being stretched, the elongation would depend on the varying cross-section. Our calculation seems right. \n\nWait, but sometimes in tapered bars, the formula for elongation is given as \u0394L = (P*L)/(E*(A1 - A2)) * ln(A1/A2), but let me check if that's applicable here. Let me recall. For a prismatic bar, \u0394L=PL/(AE). For a tapered bar with varying area, if the area varies as a function of x, then we need to integrate. But if the area varies linearly from A1 to A2 over length L, then the integral gives \u0394L = (P*L)/(E*(A2 - A1)) * ln(A2/A1). Wait, that might be the case here. Let me see. Because in our integral, the area is A(x) = A1 + (A2 - A1)x/L. Wait, in our case, we have A(x) = A1 + (A2 - A1) * (x/L). But in our problem, the width goes from 15 mm to 75 mm, so the area at any x is 20*(15 + (75-15)/500 *x) which is 20*(15 + 0.12x), which is 300 + 2.4x. So A1 (at x=0) is 300 mm\u00b2, A2 (at x=500) is 300 + 2.4*500 = 300 + 1200 = 1500 mm\u00b2. \n\nSo the formula for \u0394L would be (P*L)/(E*(A2 - A1)) * ln(A2/A1). Let's check that. Let me compute that. \n\n\u0394L = (P*L)/(E*(A2 - A1)) * ln(A2/A1)\n\nGiven P=1e5 N, L=500 mm, E=2e5 N/mm\u00b2, A1=300 mm\u00b2, A2=1500 mm\u00b2. Then:\n\nA2 - A1 = 1500 - 300 = 1200 mm\u00b2.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n\u0394L = (1e5 * 500) / (2e5 * 1200) ) * ln(1500/300)\n\nCompute numerator: 1e5 * 500 = 5e7.\n\nDenominator: 2e5 * 1200 = 2.4e8.\n\nSo 5e7 / 2.4e8 = 5/(24) \u2248 0.208333...\n\nMultiply by ln(5) \u22481.6094:\n\n0.208333 *1.6094 \u2248 0.3358 mm. Which matches the earlier result. So this confirms that the answer is approximately 0.336 mm. \n\nSo the answer should be about 0.336 mm. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, could the modulus E have been given in the wrong units? The problem states E = 2 \u00d710^5 N/mm\u00b2, which is correct. The force is 100 kN, converted to 1e5 N. The area is correctly calculated as width times thickness. \n\nAnother possible point of confusion: the bar is of uniform thickness. So the thickness is 2 cm, which is 20 mm. The width tapers, so the cross-sectional area is width (varying) multiplied by thickness (constant). That's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the calculation is correct, and the elongation is approximately 0.3358 mm, which rounds to 0.336 mm. But the problem says \"determine the elongation of plate; if an axial tensile force of 100 kN is applied on it.\" So probably, the answer is 0.336 mm. Depending on rounding, maybe 0.34 mm, but let's check the exact value. \n\nWait, let me compute more precisely. Let me use more exact numbers. \n\nln(5) is approximately 1.6094379124341003.\n\nSo (1/(2.4)) = 0.4166666666666667\n\nBut wait, the integral was (0.5) * (1/2.4) * ln(5). Wait, 0.5 * (1/2.4) = (1/4.8) \u2248 0.20833333333333334.\n\nMultiply by 1.60943791 \u2248 0.20833333 *1.60943791 \u2248 0.3358. So exactly 0.335799... mm. So about 0.3358 mm. Depending on significant figures, the given data in the problem: the force is 100 kN (two significant figures?), length 50 cm (2 sig figs?), E is 2e5 (one sig fig?), but I think in engineering problems, usually, E is given with more precision. Wait, the problem states E = 2 \u00d710^5 N/mm\u00b2. So that's one significant figure? But maybe they consider it as exact. But the original dimensions: thickness 2 cm (maybe 1 sig fig?), but probably, they assume the numbers are exact. So perhaps we can state the answer as 0.336 mm. \n\nBut in exams, sometimes they expect the answer to three decimal places, but here the answer is already in the order of 0.3 mm, which is 0.34 mm if rounded to two decimal places. But the problem says \"answer in mm\". So maybe 0.336 mm would be 0.336 mm, but they might expect rounding to three decimal places. However, maybe the exact answer is 0.336 mm. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with exact fractions. Let's compute:\n\n\u0394L = (1e5 * 500) / (2e5 * 1200) * ln(5)\n\n= (5e7) / (2.4e8) * ln(5)\n\n= (5 / 24) * ln(5)\n\nln(5) = 1.60943791...\n\nSo 5/24 is approximately 0.2083333333.\n\n0.2083333333 *1.60943791 \u2248 0.335799...\n\nSo \u0394L \u22480.3358 mm. So the answer is approximately 0.336 mm. Therefore, the elongation is 0.336 mm. \n\nNow, I need to check if this answer is the same as the standard formula for a tapered bar. Let me see. Yes, the formula \u0394L = (P*L)/(E*(A2 - A1)) * ln(A2/A1) is correct for a bar with linearly varying cross-sectional area. So using that formula gives the same result as the integral, which we did. So this confirms that the answer is correct. \n\nTherefore, the elongation is approximately 0.336 mm. So the answer should be 0.336 mm. But let me check if any step was miscalculated. For example, when converting cm to mm:\n\nOriginal dimensions:\n\nThickness: 2 cm = 20 mm.\n\nWidth at A: 1.5 cm = 15 mm.\n\nWidth at B:7.5 cm=75 mm.\n\nSo area at A: 15*20=300 mm\u00b2.\n\nArea at B:75*20=1500 mm\u00b2.\n\nYes. So that's correct. Then the length L is 50 cm=500 mm. Correct.\n\nThe integral gives us 0.3358 mm. So the answer is 0.336 mm. But in the options (if there were any), but since it's a numerical answer, we need to write it as is. Since the problem says \"determine the elongation of plate; if an axial tensile force of 100 kN is applied on it. [E = 2 \u00d710^5 N/mm\u00b2] Answer in mm\", the answer should be approximately 0.336 mm. But I need to check if there's a calculation mistake. \n\nWait, another way: Let's compute the integral again step by step.\n\n\u0394L = (100,000 N) * 500 mm / (2e5 N/mm\u00b2) * integral from 0 to 500 [1/(A(x))] dx * (1/500 mm) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated in the integral setup. Wait, the original formula is \u0394L = integral (from 0 to L) [ (P dx) / (A(x) E ) ]\n\nSo, P is 1e5 N, E is 2e5 N/mm\u00b2, dx is in mm. A(x) is in mm\u00b2.\n\nSo each term (P / (A E )) dx has units: (N) / (mm\u00b2 * N/mm\u00b2) ) * mm = (N / (N/mm)) * mm = mm\u00b2. Wait, wait, check units:\n\nE is N/mm\u00b2. A is mm\u00b2. So A*E is mm\u00b2 * N/mm\u00b2 = N. Then P/(A E) is (N)/(N) = dimensionless. Then dx is in mm. So the integral has units of mm. Correct.\n\nBut when calculating, let's redo the setup:\n\n\u0394L = \u222b0^500 [ (1e5) / (A(x) * 2e5) ] dx\n\nA(x) = 300 + 2.4x.\n\nSo:\n\n\u0394L = (1e5 / 2e5) \u222b0^500 [1/(300 + 2.4x)] dx\n\n= 0.5 \u222b0^500 [1/(300 + 2.4x)] dx\n\nLet\u2019s compute the integral:\n\nLet u = 300 + 2.4x \u2192 du = 2.4 dx \u2192 dx = du / 2.4\n\nWhen x=0, u=300.\n\nWhen x=500, u=300 + 2.4*500 = 300 + 1200 = 1500.\n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b from u=300 to 1500 [1/u] * (du / 2.4) )\n\n= (1/2.4) [ln(u)] from 300 to 1500\n\n= (1/2.4) [ln(1500) - ln(300)] = (1/2.4) ln(1500/300) = (1/2.4) ln(5)\n\nMultiply by 0.5:\n\n\u0394L = 0.5 * (1/2.4) * ln(5) \u2248 0.5 * 0.416666... * 1.6094 \u2248 0.5 * 0.6708 \u2248 0.3354 mm\n\nSo yes, approximately 0.3354 mm. So rounding to three decimal places, 0.335 mm. But usually, engineering answers might go to three significant figures. Let's see: the given data:\n\n- Thickness: 2 cm (one significant figure? If it's 2.0 cm, then two. But as written, 2 cm is possibly one sig fig.)\n\n- Width at ends: 1.5 cm (two sig figs) and 7.5 cm (two sig figs).\n\n- Length: 50 cm (two sig figs).\n\n- Force: 100 kN (three sig figs).\n\n- E: 2e5 N/mm\u00b2 (one sig fig).\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, in such problems, usually, the given data's least number of significant figures determines the answer's sig figs. Here, E is given with one significant figure (2e5), which would suggest the answer should be given to one significant figure, i.e., 0.3 mm. However, sometimes in engineering contexts, even with one significant figure in E, other data may have more, and sometimes the answer is expected to two or three. But given that the calculation gives approximately 0.3358 mm, and the options (if any) might require more precision, but here the user just says to answer in mm. Since the calculation is about 0.336 mm, but in terms of the problem's given data, perhaps the answer should be 0.336 mm, or maybe 0.34 mm. However, I think exact calculation using the formula would give 0.3358 mm, which would be 0.336 mm when rounded to three decimal places, but since the question says \"answer in mm\", maybe they expect it to three decimal places, but perhaps to the nearest hundredth. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 0.336 mm, which is 0.336 mm. Let me check with exact fractions.\n\nWait, ln(5) is exactly ln(5). So 0.5*(1/2.4)*ln(5) = (1/4.8)*ln(5). Let me compute this exactly:\n\n1/4.8 = 5/24 \u22480.208333...\n\nMultiply by ln(5) \u22481.60943791:\n\n0.2083333333 *1.60943791 \u2248 0.335799...\n\nSo approximately 0.3358 mm. So 0.3358 mm is 0.336 mm when rounded to three decimal places, but if we're to present it as per the problem's requirement, maybe two decimal places. However, the problem doesn't specify, but just says \"answer in mm\". So the answer is approximately 0.336 mm. But 0.336 mm is 0.336 millimeters. So the answer is 0.336 mm. However, in the problem statement, all given data are in centimeters and converted correctly to millimeters. The calculation is precise, so the answer should be 0.336 mm. Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the area calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nAt x=0 (end A), width is 15 mm, thickness 20 mm, area 15*20=300 mm\u00b2. At x=500 mm (end B), width 75 mm, area 75*20=1500 mm\u00b2. The variation in width is linear, so the slope is (75-15)/500 = 60/500 = 0.12 mm/mm. Thus, width at x is 15 +0.12x, so area is 20*(15+0.12x) = 300 +2.4x. Correct. So the integral is correct. \n\nTherefore, the elongation is approximately 0.336 mm. So the answer is 0.336 mm.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The steel bar tapers uniformly, so its cross-sectional area varies linearly from 300 mm\u00b2 to 1500 mm\u00b2 over 500 mm.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about a steel bar that's tapering, and I need to find its elongation when a tensile force is applied. Hmm. The bar has a uniform thickness of 2 cm, and it tapers from 1.5 cm to 7.5 cm over a length of 50 cm. The force is 100 kN, and the modulus of elasticity E is given as 2e5 N/mm\u00b2. The answer needs to be in mm. \n\nFirst, I remember that for axially loaded members, the elongation can be calculated using the formula \u0394L = (P * L) / (A * E), but that's when the cross-sectional area A is constant. But in this case, the bar is tapered, so the area varies along the length. That means the simple formula won't work here. Instead, I think I need to use integration over the length since each infinitesimal segment will have a different area.\n\nThe bar is of uniform thickness, 2 cm. Wait, the thickness is 2 cm, and the width tapers from 1.5 cm to 7.5 cm. So the cross-sectional area at any point would be the width times the thickness. Since thickness is constant, the area varies linearly from the narrow end to the wider end. Let me visualize this. The bar is 50 cm long (which is 500 mm), and at one end (let's say end A), the width is 1.5 cm (15 mm), and at end B, it's 7.5 cm (75 mm). The thickness is 2 cm (20 mm). So the cross-sectional area at A is 15 mm * 20 mm = 300 mm\u00b2, and at B, it's 75 mm * 20 mm = 1500 mm\u00b2. \n\nSince the bar tapers uniformly, the width increases linearly along the length. Let me define the x-axis along the length of the bar, with x=0 at end A (narrow end) and x=500 mm at end B. At any position x, the width w(x) can be expressed as a linear function. The rate of increase in width per unit length is (75 mm - 15 mm)/500 mm = 60 mm / 500 mm = 0.12 mm per mm of length. So the width as a function of x is w(x) = 15 mm + 0.12x (where x is in mm). \n\nBut wait, actually, let me check that. At x=0, width is 15 mm, and at x=500 mm, width is 75 mm. So the slope is (75-15)/500 = 60/500 = 0.12 mm/mm. So yes, the equation is correct: w(x) = 15 + 0.12x (mm). Then the area A(x) is width * thickness, which is w(x) * 20 mm. So A(x) = 20*(15 + 0.12x) = 300 + 2.4x mm\u00b2.\n\nNow, the formula for elongation when the area varies along the length is an integral from 0 to L of (P dx)/(A(x) E). Since the force P is axial and constant along the length (assuming static equilibrium and no other forces), that's 100 kN, which is 100,000 N. E is 2e5 N/mm\u00b2. So putting it all together:\n\n\u0394L = integral from 0 to 500 mm [ (100,000 N) / (A(x) * 2e5 N/mm\u00b2) ) dx ]\n\nFirst, let's write that out. Let's substitute A(x):\n\n\u0394L = \u222b (100,000) / [ (300 + 2.4x) * 2e5 ] dx from 0 to 500.\n\nSimplify the constants. 100,000 / 2e5 = 100,000 / 200,000 = 0.5. So:\n\n\u0394L = 0.5 \u222b [1 / (300 + 2.4x)] dx from 0 to 500.\n\nLet me compute this integral. The integral of 1/(a + bx) dx is (1/b) ln(a + bx) + C. So here, a=300, b=2.4.\n\nSo the integral becomes 0.5 * [ (1/2.4) * ln(300 + 2.4x) ) ] evaluated from 0 to 500.\n\nCompute the definite integral:\n\nAt upper limit (500):\n\nln(300 + 2.4*500) = ln(300 + 1200) = ln(1500)\n\nAt lower limit (0):\n\nln(300 + 0) = ln(300)\n\nSo the integral value is 0.5 * (1/2.4) [ ln(1500) - ln(300) ] = (0.5 / 2.4) * ln(1500/300) = (0.5 / 2.4) * ln(5)\n\nCalculate ln(5) \u2248 1.6094.\n\nSo now:\n\n0.5 / 2.4 = 1/(4.8) \u2248 0.208333...\n\nMultiply that by 1.6094: 0.208333 * 1.6094 \u2248 0.3358.\n\nSo \u0394L \u2248 0.3358 mm.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify each part.\n\nFirst, converting all units correctly. The length is 50 cm = 500 mm. The widths are in cm converted to mm: 1.5 cm is 15 mm, 7.5 cm is 75 mm. Thickness is 2 cm = 20 mm. So the area at any point is width (mm) * 20 mm. The modulus E is given as 2e5 N/mm\u00b2, which is correct. The force is 100 kN = 1e5 N. \n\nThe integral setup seems correct. The integral of 1/(a + bx) dx is indeed (1/b) ln(a +bx). \n\nWait, let me recheck the integral calculation:\n\nIntegral from 0 to 500 of [1/(300 + 2.4x)] dx.\n\nLet u = 300 + 2.4x. Then du = 2.4 dx \u2192 dx = du/2.4.\n\nLimits: when x=0, u=300; x=500, u=300 + 2.4*500 = 300 + 1200 = 1500.\n\nSo integral becomes (1/2.4) \u222b from u=300 to 1500 (1/u) du = (1/2.4)(ln 1500 - ln 300) = (1/2.4) ln(5) \u2248 (1/2.4)*1.6094 \u2248 0.6706. Then multiply by 0.5 (from the earlier 0.5 factor):\n\n0.5 * 0.6706 \u2248 0.3353 mm. So about 0.335 mm. But let's check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait, the 0.5 comes from 100,000/(2e5) = 0.5. Then the integral is 0.5 * [ (1/2.4)(ln(1500) - ln(300)) ].\n\nSo 0.5 * (1/2.4) is 1/(4.8) \u2248 0.20833. Multiply by ln(5) \u22481.6094: 0.20833 *1.6094\u22480.3358. So yes, approximately 0.3358 mm. So the elongation is about 0.336 mm. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm the direction of the taper. The question says the bar tapers uniformly from 1.5 cm to 7.5 cm. So which end is which? If the bar is AB, then perhaps A is the narrow end (1.5 cm) and B is the wider end (7.5 cm). But when we applied the force axially, the area increases from A to B. The formula is correct as set up because we considered x from 0 (A) to 500 mm (B). \n\nBut in the original problem statement, it's a tensile force. Since the bar is being stretched, the elongation would depend on the varying cross-section. Our calculation seems right. \n\nWait, but sometimes in tapered bars, the formula for elongation is given as \u0394L = (P*L)/(E*(A1 - A2)) * ln(A1/A2), but let me check if that's applicable here. Let me recall. For a prismatic bar, \u0394L=PL/(AE). For a tapered bar with varying area, if the area varies as a function of x, then we need to integrate. But if the area varies linearly from A1 to A2 over length L, then the integral gives \u0394L = (P*L)/(E*(A2 - A1)) * ln(A2/A1). Wait, that might be the case here. Let me see. Because in our integral, the area is A(x) = A1 + (A2 - A1)x/L. Wait, in our case, we have A(x) = A1 + (A2 - A1) * (x/L). But in our problem, the width goes from 15 mm to 75 mm, so the area at any x is 20*(15 + (75-15)/500 *x) which is 20*(15 + 0.12x), which is 300 + 2.4x. So A1 (at x=0) is 300 mm\u00b2, A2 (at x=500) is 300 + 2.4*500 = 300 + 1200 = 1500 mm\u00b2. \n\nSo the formula for \u0394L would be (P*L)/(E*(A2 - A1)) * ln(A2/A1). Let's check that. Let me compute that. \n\n\u0394L = (P*L)/(E*(A2 - A1)) * ln(A2/A1)\n\nGiven P=1e5 N, L=500 mm, E=2e5 N/mm\u00b2, A1=300 mm\u00b2, A2=1500 mm\u00b2. Then:\n\nA2 - A1 = 1500 - 300 = 1200 mm\u00b2.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n\u0394L = (1e5 * 500) / (2e5 * 1200) ) * ln(1500/300)\n\nCompute numerator: 1e5 * 500 = 5e7.\n\nDenominator: 2e5 * 1200 = 2.4e8.\n\nSo 5e7 / 2.4e8 = 5/(24) \u2248 0.208333...\n\nMultiply by ln(5) \u22481.6094:\n\n0.208333 *1.6094 \u2248 0.3358 mm. Which matches the earlier result. So this confirms that the answer is approximately 0.336 mm. \n\nSo the answer should be about 0.336 mm. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, could the modulus E have been given in the wrong units? The problem states E = 2 \u00d710^5 N/mm\u00b2, which is correct. The force is 100 kN, converted to 1e5 N. The area is correctly calculated as width times thickness. \n\nAnother possible point of confusion: the bar is of uniform thickness. So the thickness is 2 cm, which is 20 mm. The width tapers, so the cross-sectional area is width (varying) multiplied by thickness (constant). That's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the calculation is correct, and the elongation is approximately 0.3358 mm, which rounds to 0.336 mm. But the problem says \"determine the elongation of plate; if an axial tensile force of 100 kN is applied on it.\" So probably, the answer is 0.336 mm. Depending on rounding, maybe 0.34 mm, but let's check the exact value. \n\nWait, let me compute more precisely. Let me use more exact numbers. \n\nln(5) is approximately 1.6094379124341003.\n\nSo (1/(2.4)) = 0.4166666666666667\n\nBut wait, the integral was (0.5) * (1/2.4) * ln(5). Wait, 0.5 * (1/2.4) = (1/4.8) \u2248 0.20833333333333334.\n\nMultiply by 1.60943791 \u2248 0.20833333 *1.60943791 \u2248 0.3358. So exactly 0.335799... mm. So about 0.3358 mm. Depending on significant figures, the given data in the problem: the force is 100 kN (two significant figures?), length 50 cm (2 sig figs?), E is 2e5 (one sig fig?), but I think in engineering problems, usually, E is given with more precision. Wait, the problem states E = 2 \u00d710^5 N/mm\u00b2. So that's one significant figure? But maybe they consider it as exact. But the original dimensions: thickness 2 cm (maybe 1 sig fig?), but probably, they assume the numbers are exact. So perhaps we can state the answer as 0.336 mm. \n\nBut in exams, sometimes they expect the answer to three decimal places, but here the answer is already in the order of 0.3 mm, which is 0.34 mm if rounded to two decimal places. But the problem says \"answer in mm\". So maybe 0.336 mm would be 0.336 mm, but they might expect rounding to three decimal places. However, maybe the exact answer is 0.336 mm. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with exact fractions. Let's compute:\n\n\u0394L = (1e5 * 500) / (2e5 * 1200) * ln(5)\n\n= (5e7) / (2.4e8) * ln(5)\n\n= (5 / 24) * ln(5)\n\nln(5) = 1.60943791...\n\nSo 5/24 is approximately 0.2083333333.\n\n0.2083333333 *1.60943791 \u2248 0.335799...\n\nSo \u0394L \u22480.3358 mm. So the answer is approximately 0.336 mm. Therefore, the elongation is 0.336 mm. \n\nNow, I need to check if this answer is the same as the standard formula for a tapered bar. Let me see. Yes, the formula \u0394L = (P*L)/(E*(A2 - A1)) * ln(A2/A1) is correct for a bar with linearly varying cross-sectional area. So using that formula gives the same result as the integral, which we did. So this confirms that the answer is correct. \n\nTherefore, the elongation is approximately 0.336 mm. So the answer should be 0.336 mm. But let me check if any step was miscalculated. For example, when converting cm to mm:\n\nOriginal dimensions:\n\nThickness: 2 cm = 20 mm.\n\nWidth at A: 1.5 cm = 15 mm.\n\nWidth at B:7.5 cm=75 mm.\n\nSo area at A: 15*20=300 mm\u00b2.\n\nArea at B:75*20=1500 mm\u00b2.\n\nYes. So that's correct. Then the length L is 50 cm=500 mm. Correct.\n\nThe integral gives us 0.3358 mm. So the answer is 0.336 mm. But in the options (if there were any), but since it's a numerical answer, we need to write it as is. Since the problem says \"determine the elongation of plate; if an axial tensile force of 100 kN is applied on it. [E = 2 \u00d710^5 N/mm\u00b2] Answer in mm\", the answer should be approximately 0.336 mm. But I need to check if there's a calculation mistake. \n\nWait, another way: Let's compute the integral again step by step.\n\n\u0394L = (100,000 N) * 500 mm / (2e5 N/mm\u00b2) * integral from 0 to 500 [1/(A(x))] dx * (1/500 mm) ?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated in the integral setup. Wait, the original formula is \u0394L = integral (from 0 to L) [ (P dx) / (A(x) E ) ]\n\nSo, P is 1e5 N, E is 2e5 N/mm\u00b2, dx is in mm. A(x) is in mm\u00b2.\n\nSo each term (P / (A E )) dx has units: (N) / (mm\u00b2 * N/mm\u00b2) ) * mm = (N / (N/mm)) * mm = mm\u00b2. Wait, wait, check units:\n\nE is N/mm\u00b2. A is mm\u00b2. So A*E is mm\u00b2 * N/mm\u00b2 = N. Then P/(A E) is (N)/(N) = dimensionless. Then dx is in mm. So the integral has units of mm. Correct.\n\nBut when calculating, let's redo the setup:\n\n\u0394L = \u222b0^500 [ (1e5) / (A(x) * 2e5) ] dx\n\nA(x) = 300 + 2.4x.\n\nSo:\n\n\u0394L = (1e5 / 2e5) \u222b0^500 [1/(300 + 2.4x)] dx\n\n= 0.5 \u222b0^500 [1/(300 + 2.4x)] dx\n\nLet\u2019s compute the integral:\n\nLet u = 300 + 2.4x \u2192 du = 2.4 dx \u2192 dx = du / 2.4\n\nWhen x=0, u=300.\n\nWhen x=500, u=300 + 2.4*500 = 300 + 1200 = 1500.\n\nThus, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b from u=300 to 1500 [1/u] * (du / 2.4) )\n\n= (1/2.4) [ln(u)] from 300 to 1500\n\n= (1/2.4) [ln(1500) - ln(300)] = (1/2.4) ln(1500/300) = (1/2.4) ln(5)\n\nMultiply by 0.5:\n\n\u0394L = 0.5 * (1/2.4) * ln(5) \u2248 0.5 * 0.416666... * 1.6094 \u2248 0.5 * 0.6708 \u2248 0.3354 mm\n\nSo yes, approximately 0.3354 mm. So rounding to three decimal places, 0.335 mm. But usually, engineering answers might go to three significant figures. Let's see: the given data:\n\n- Thickness: 2 cm (one significant figure? If it's 2.0 cm, then two. But as written, 2 cm is possibly one sig fig.)\n\n- Width at ends: 1.5 cm (two sig figs) and 7.5 cm (two sig figs).\n\n- Length: 50 cm (two sig figs).\n\n- Force: 100 kN (three sig figs).\n\n- E: 2e5 N/mm\u00b2 (one sig fig).\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, in such problems, usually, the given data's least number of significant figures determines the answer's sig figs. Here, E is given with one significant figure (2e5), which would suggest the answer should be given to one significant figure, i.e., 0.3 mm. However, sometimes in engineering contexts, even with one significant figure in E, other data may have more, and sometimes the answer is expected to two or three. But given that the calculation gives approximately 0.3358 mm, and the options (if any) might require more precision, but here the user just says to answer in mm. Since the calculation is about 0.336 mm, but in terms of the problem's given data, perhaps the answer should be 0.336 mm, or maybe 0.34 mm. However, I think exact calculation using the formula would give 0.3358 mm, which would be 0.336 mm when rounded to three decimal places, but since the question says \"answer in mm\", maybe they expect it to three decimal places, but perhaps to the nearest hundredth. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 0.336 mm, which is 0.336 mm. Let me check with exact fractions.\n\nWait, ln(5) is exactly ln(5). So 0.5*(1/2.4)*ln(5) = (1/4.8)*ln(5). Let me compute this exactly:\n\n1/4.8 = 5/24 \u22480.208333...\n\nMultiply by ln(5) \u22481.60943791:\n\n0.2083333333 *1.60943791 \u2248 0.335799...\n\nSo approximately 0.3358 mm. So 0.3358 mm is 0.336 mm when rounded to three decimal places, but if we're to present it as per the problem's requirement, maybe two decimal places. However, the problem doesn't specify, but just says \"answer in mm\". So the answer is approximately 0.336 mm. But 0.336 mm is 0.336 millimeters. So the answer is 0.336 mm. However, in the problem statement, all given data are in centimeters and converted correctly to millimeters. The calculation is precise, so the answer should be 0.336 mm. Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the area calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nAt x=0 (end A), width is 15 mm, thickness 20 mm, area 15*20=300 mm\u00b2. At x=500 mm (end B), width 75 mm, area 75*20=1500 mm\u00b2. The variation in width is linear, so the slope is (75-15)/500 = 60/500 = 0.12 mm/mm. Thus, width at x is 15 +0.12x, so area is 20*(15+0.12x) = 300 +2.4x. Correct. So the integral is correct. \n\nTherefore, the elongation is approximately 0.336 mm. So the answer is 0.336 mm.",
