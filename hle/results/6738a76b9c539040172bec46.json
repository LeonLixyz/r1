Note that $A$ is massive while $B$, $C$, and $D$ are massless. Thus the decay of the A into the other three is kinematically allowed. Compute, to the lowest non-vanishing order of perturbation theory, the total decay width of the A. What would the answer be if the interaction were instead $gAB^3$?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the decay width of a scalar particle A into three other scalars B, C, and D. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is gABCD. Then we also need to consider the case where the interaction is gAB\u00b3 instead. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the decay width is calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule or, more formally, using the formula from quantum field theory. For a decay process A \u2192 B + C + D (or A \u2192 three particles), the decay width \u0393 is given by the matrix element squared, integrated over the phase space of the final state particles.\n\nThe general formula is \u0393 = (1/(2m_A)) * \u222b |M|\u00b2 d\u03a6, where d\u03a6 is the phase space element. Since we're working at the lowest non-vanishing order in perturbation theory, we need to look at the Feynman diagram that contributes to this process. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is gABCD, so the vertex connecting A, B, C, D has a coupling constant g. Therefore, the leading-order diagram for A decaying into B, C, D is a tree-level diagram with one vertex. The matrix element M should just be g (times some factors from the Feynman rules), because it's a tree-level process with a single vertex.\n\nWait, scalar particles... So the Feynman rule for a quartic vertex like ABCD would be -ig (since the interaction term is +gABCD in the Lagrangian, and the vertex factor is -i times the coupling). But in the decay amplitude, we have to include this vertex factor. So the matrix element M is -i g. However, when calculating |M|\u00b2, the i's would square to -1 and give us |M|\u00b2 = g\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a symmetry factor here? Let's think. The interaction term is gABCD, meaning that all four fields are different. So when calculating the vertex, there's no symmetry factors to consider because all particles are distinct. So the amplitude is just -i g, leading to |M|\u00b2 = g\u00b2.\n\nNow, the decay width \u0393 is (1/(2m_A)) * (\u222b |M|\u00b2 d\u03a6). The phase space integral for a three-body decay in the rest frame of A is more complicated than for two-body. But perhaps, since all the outgoing particles are massless (B, C, D are massless), the calculation simplifies?\n\nWait, the problem states that A is massive (mass m), and B, C, D are massless. So the decay is A \u2192 B + C + D. The phase space integral for three massless particles might have some simplifications.\n\nBut three-body phase space integrals can be tricky. Let me recall the general formula for the decay width. In the center-of-mass frame of A, the total energy is m_A, and the three outgoing particles (massless) will each have energies E1, E2, E3 such that E1 + E2 + E3 = m_A. Also, their momenta vectors should add up to zero.\n\nBut the exact integral requires evaluating something like \u222b \u03b4^4(p_A - p1 - p2 - p3) [d^3 p1/(2E1)] [d^3 p2/(2E2)] [d^3 p3/(2E3)].\n\nBut this is complicated. However, maybe there is a standard result for the three-body phase space when all the outgoing particles are massless. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to approximate it or relate it to a dimensionless integral.\n\nAlternatively, since all outgoing particles are massless, maybe we can use dimensional analysis. The decay width \u0393 has dimensions of energy. The coupling g has dimensions. Let's check the dimensions. The Lagrangian term gABCD has to have dimensions of [mass]^4 (since the Lagrangian density has dimensions [mass]^4 in natural units where \u0127=c=1). Each scalar field has dimension [mass]^1 (since the kinetic term (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)^2 has [mass]^4, so \u03c6 must be [mass]^1). Therefore, g has dimension [mass]^0 (because [g][A][B][C][D] = [g][mass]^4 = [mass]^4 \u2192 [g] = [mass]^0, i.e., dimensionless). Wait, but that's in 4-dimensional spacetime? Wait, in 4 dimensions, the scalar fields have dimension [mass]^{(4-2)/2} = [mass]^1. So when you multiply four scalar fields, each of dimension 1, the product has dimension 4. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so g must be dimensionless. So yes, g is dimensionless. So \u0393, which has dimensions of mass, would be proportional to g\u00b2 m_A, since m_A is the only mass scale in the problem (since B, C, D are massless). But wait, \u0393 has to have units of mass. So \u0393 ~ g\u00b2 m_A. But with possible numerical factors from the phase space integral.\n\nIn the case of a three-body decay, the phase space integral for massless particles... I think there's a standard result. For example, in the decay of a muon into three electrons, but that's a different process. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the three-body phase space. For three massless particles, the integral simplifies. Let me recall that for a three-body decay of a particle of mass M into three massless particles, the total phase space volume (without considering the matrix element) is proportional to M\u00b2/(256 \u03c0\u00b3). Wait, perhaps? Let me check. The general formula for the three-body phase space (in 4 dimensions) is:\n\nd\u03a6 = (1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * (1/(32 M)) * \u222b ds dt,\n\nwhere s and t are Mandelstam variables, but this might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, in the case where all three particles are massless, the integral can be done in terms of the angles between the particles. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that the total three-body phase space for massless decay products is (M^2)/(256 \u03c0^3).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think differently. For a two-body decay into massless particles, the phase space is much simpler. For example, the decay width for a particle of mass M into two massless particles (assuming a matrix element that's constant) would be \u0393 = (g\u00b2)/(16 \u03c0 M), but that's for two-body. For three-body, the phase space integral would have more integrals. But perhaps when the matrix element is constant (as in our case, since M = g), the integral can be evaluated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula from particle physics. For a three-body decay with a constant matrix element, the decay width \u0393 is given by (g\u00b2)/(2 m_A) multiplied by the three-body phase space. And the three-body phase space for massless particles would be proportional to m_A\u00b2/(something). Let me recall that in the case where all three particles are massless, the phase space integral can be found using the formula:\n\n\u03a6_3 = (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3)}.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the three-body phase space integral for massless particles. The general formula for the differential phase space is:\n\nd\u03a6_3 = (1/(2\u03c0))^3 (d^3 p1/(2 E1)) (d^3 p2/(2 E2)) (d^3 p3/(2 E3)) \u03b4^4(p_A - p1 - p2 - p3)\n\nIn the rest frame of A, p_A = (m_A, 0, 0, 0). The three outgoing particles have energies E1, E2, E3, with E1 + E2 + E3 = m_A, and their momenta vectors sum to zero. Since they are massless, |p_i| = E_i.\n\nBut to compute this integral, one can first fix the momentum of particle 1, then particle 2, and particle 3 is determined by momentum conservation. However, this becomes complex. There's a method to compute the three-body phase space by using the invariant variables. Alternatively, using the formula for the total three-body phase space when the matrix element is constant.\n\nThe formula for the three-body decay phase space integral (without any matrix element dependence) can be found in textbooks. For example, in the PDG review or in Thomson's \"Modern Particle Physics\". According to Thomson, the three-body phase space for massless particles is:\n\n\u03a6_3 = (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3)}.\n\nBut I need to verify this. Let me try to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, let's parameterize the problem. For massless particles, each momentum vector has magnitude equal to their energy. Let me work in the center-of-mass frame. Let me use spherical coordinates for two of the particles and then relate the third. Alternatively, use the Dalitz plot approach. But maybe this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall that for the decay of a particle into three massless particles, the phase space integral is:\n\n\u03a6_3 = \u222b [d^3 p1/(2 E1 (2\u03c0)^3))] [d^3 p2/(2 E2 (2\u03c0)^3))] [d^3 p3/(2 E3 (2\u03c0)^3))] (2\u03c0)^4 \u03b4^4(p_A - p1 - p2 - p3)\n\nFactor out the (2\u03c0) factors: (1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * \u222b [d^3 p1 d^3 p2 d^3 p3)/(8 E1 E2 E3)] \u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - E3) \u03b4^3(p1 + p2 + p3)\n\nThis integral can be simplified by using the momentum delta function to fix p3 = -p1 -p2. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n(1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * \u222b [d^3 p1 d^3 p2)/(8 E1 E2 E3)] \u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - E3)\n\nBut E3 = |p3| = |p1 + p2|. For massless particles, E3 = |p1 + p2|. Let me switch to spherical coordinates for p1 and p2. But this still seems complicated. However, since all particles are massless, maybe there's a way to compute the integral by scaling variables. Let me consider variables x_i = E_i / m_A, so that x1 + x2 + x3 = 1. Then, the delta function becomes \u03b4(m_A (1 - x1 -x2 -x3)) ) / m_A.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider that for three massless particles, the integral over angles might factor out. Let me suppose that the matrix element is a constant (which it is in this case, since M = -i g, so |M|^2 = g^2). Then, the decay width \u0393 is (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * \u03a6_3, where \u03a6_3 is the three-body phase space integral.\n\nBut I need to find \u03a6_3. Let me recall that for three-body phase space with massless particles, the integral can be evaluated and the result is (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3). If that's the case, then \u0393 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3) ) = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0^3). But I'm not sure about the numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use dimensional analysis. Since \u0393 has units of mass, and the only parameters are g (dimensionless) and m_A (mass), then \u0393 must be proportional to g\u00b2 m_A. The numerical factor comes from the phase space integral. The answer would then be \u0393 = (g^2 m_A)/(something * (2\u03c0)^n), where something is a number from the phase space integration.\n\nAlternatively, I can check a standard decay process. For example, the decay rate for a Z boson into three massless neutrinos would be a similar process, but the matrix element would not be constant. However, in the case where the matrix element is a constant, the phase space would give the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up the formula for three-body phase space in the case of massless decay products and a constant matrix element. According to some references, the total decay width for a scalar decaying into three massless scalars with a coupling g is given by \u0393 = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0\u00b3)}. But I need to confirm the coefficient.\n\nWait, let's try to compute it. Let's start with the phase space integral:\n\n\u03a6_3 = \u222b [d^3 p1/(2 E1 (2\u03c0)^3))] [d^3 p2/(2 E2 (2\u03c0)^3))] [d^3 p3/(2 E3 (2\u03c0)^3))] (2\u03c0)^4 \u03b4^4(p_A - p1 - p2 - p3)\n\nFirst, notice that the integral is Lorentz invariant, so we can compute it in the rest frame of A. Then, p_A = (m_A, 0), and the three momenta p1, p2, p3 must satisfy p1 + p2 + p3 = 0 and E1 + E2 + E3 = m_A. For massless particles, E_i = |p_i|.\n\nWe can use the momentum-conservation delta function to eliminate p3. So set p3 = -p1 - p2. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n\u03a6_3 = (1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * \u222b [d^3 p1 d^3 p2)/(8 E1 E2 |p1 + p2|)] \u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - |p1 + p2|)\n\nThis is still complicated, but maybe we can use spherical coordinates. Let's express p1 and p2 in spherical coordinates. Let's first fix p1 in the z-direction, then p2 will have angles relative to p1. However, due to the symmetry, the integral should not depend on the direction of p1, so we can integrate over the angles of p2 relative to p1.\n\nLet me set p1 along the z-axis. Then, p1 = (0, 0, E1) (since E1 = |p1|). Then, p2 has spherical coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6), and its magnitude E2. Then, |p1 + p2| can be found using the cosine law: |p1 + p2|\u00b2 = E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between p1 and p2. Therefore, |p1 + p2| = sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 cos\u03b8) = E3.\n\nBut since we are dealing with massless particles, E3 must equal |p1 + p2|. The delta function becomes \u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 cos\u03b8)).\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can change variables. Let u = cos\u03b8. Then, the delta function is:\n\n\u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u))\n\nLet me denote the argument of the delta function as f(u) = m_A - E1 - E2 - sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u). The integral over u can be done using the delta function. The root is solved when:\n\nsqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u) = m_A - E1 - E2\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nE1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u = (m_A - E1 - E2)^2 = m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A(E1 + E2) + (E1 + E2)^2\n\nExpanding the RHS:\n\n= m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A E1 - 2 m_A E2 + E1\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2\u00b2\n\nSetting equal to LHS:\n\nE1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u = m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A(E1 + E2) + E1\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2\u00b2\n\nCancel E1\u00b2 and E2\u00b2:\n\n2 E1 E2 u = m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A(E1 + E2) + 2 E1 E2\n\nSolving for u:\n\nu = [m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A(E1 + E2) + 2 E1 E2]/(2 E1 E2)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A E1 - 2 m_A E2 + 2 E1 E2\n\nBut the delta function \u03b4(f(u)) can be written as \u03b4(u - u0)/|f'(u0)|}, where u0 is the solution above.\n\nFirst, compute f'(u):\n\nf(u) = m_A - E1 - E2 - sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u)\n\ndf/du = - (1/(2 sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u))) ) * 2 E1 E2\n\n= - (E1 E2)/sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u)\n\nAt u = u0, sqrt(...) = m_A - E1 - E2\n\nTherefore, |df/du| at u0 is (E1 E2)/(m_A - E1 - E2)\n\nSo the delta function integral over u gives:\n\n\u03a6_3 becomes:\n\n(1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * \u222b [E1\u00b2 dE1 d\u03a91/(2 E1))] [E2\u00b2 dE2 d\u03a92/(2 E2))] [1/(8 E1 E2 |p1 + p2|))] * [ (m_A - E1 - E2)/ (E1 E2) ) ]^{-1} * \u03b4(...)\n\nWait, this is getting too involved. Let me try to proceed step by step.\n\nAfter integrating over u using the delta function, the remaining variables are E1, E2, and the angles, but due to the delta function, we have constraints. Also, note that the angles for p1 and p2 are integrated over. However, since we've fixed p1 along the z-axis and p2 in the corresponding spherical coordinates, the integral over \u03c6 (azimuthal angle) for p2 would be from 0 to 2\u03c0, and \u03b8 (polar angle) is replaced by the delta function.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use the following approach: since the problem is symmetric, the total phase space integral can be written in terms of the variables x1 = E1/m_A, x2 = E2/m_A, and x3 = E3/m_A, with x1 + x2 + x3 = 1. But since the particles are massless, E3 = |p3| = |p1 + p2|. However, this might not directly translate to a simple relation between x1 and x2.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral over the energies E1 and E2. For massless particles, the energy is the magnitude of the momentum, so the integration variables for each particle are E and solid angles. But after integrating over angles and using momentum conservation, the integral reduces to integrals over E1, E2, and the angle between them.\n\nBut this seems too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. For three-body phase space with massless particles, the integral over phase space is known to be:\n\n\u03a6_3 = (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3)}\n\nSo then \u0393 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3) ) = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0^3}\n\nBut I need to check where the factors come from. Let me see:\n\nThe amplitude squared is |M|^2 = g\u00b2. Then, the decay width is:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * \u222b |M|^2 d\u03a6_3 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * \u03a6_3\n\nIf \u03a6_3 = (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3)}, then \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0^3)\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phase space is (m_A^2)/(128 \u03c0^3)}, leading to \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A/(256 \u03c0^3}\n\nBut I need to recall the exact expression. Let me think of an example: muon decay. However, muon decay has a matrix element that's not constant, so the phase space integral would be different. Alternatively, for a hypothetical scalar decaying into three massless scalars with a point interaction, the formula would have the phase space factor as (m_A^5)/(something). Wait, no, if the matrix element is constant, then \u0393 would be proportional to m_A.\n\nWait, actually, in scalar \u03c6\u2074 theory, the decay width of a particle into three others would have a certain dependence. But in this case, the problem is a \u03c6\u00b3 interaction? No, the interaction is ABCD, which is a four-scalar interaction. Wait, the interaction term is gABCD, which is a quartic term. Therefore, the vertex is four scalar particles. However, the decay is of A into B, C, D. So it's a three-body decay. Therefore, the vertex connects four particles, so one incoming (A) and three outgoing (B, C, D). Therefore, the matrix element is proportional to g, and the calculation proceeds as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a combinatorial factor. For example, in the case where the interaction term is gABCD, the number of ways to connect the fields in the vertex. But since all are distinct, there is no symmetry factor. The vertex factor is just -i g, and the Feynman rule gives that. Therefore, the amplitude is -i g, and |M|\u00b2 = g\u00b2.\n\nBut when calculating the decay width, one must also include the symmetry factor for identical particles in the final state. However, in this case, B, C, D are distinct fields. The problem states they are different (as they are labeled differently). Therefore, there's no symmetry factor. So the integral is as above.\n\nAssuming that \u03a6_3 = m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3)}, then the decay width \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A/(512 \u03c0^3}\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the numerical factor. Alternatively, maybe the phase space integral for three massless particles has a factor of 1/(256 \u03c0^3 m_A)}. Wait, no. Let me try to look up the formula for three-body phase space in 4 dimensions.\n\nAccording to some sources, the three-body phase space for massless particles can be written as:\n\n\u03a6_3 = \\frac{m_A^2}{256 \\pi^3}\n\nBut I need to confirm. Ok, let's proceed. So if \u03a6_3 = m_A^2/(256 \u03c0^3)}, then multiplying by |M|\u00b2/(2 m_A)}, which is g\u00b2/(2 m_A)}, gives \u0393 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * (m_A\u00b2)/(256 \u03c0^3)) = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0^3}\n\nSo that's the answer for the first part.\n\nNow, the second part asks about the interaction term being gAB\u00b3 instead. So the interaction is gAB\u00b3. Now, B is a real scalar field. So the term is gABBB. Therefore, the vertex would have one A and three B's. However, since B is a real scalar field, the interaction term is gAB\u00b3. So the Feynman rule for this vertex would have a coupling factor of -i g multiplied by the number of permutations for identical particles. But since all three B's are identical, the symmetry factor for the vertex is 3! = 6. Wait, no. The vertex factor for a term like gAB\u00b3 would be -i g multiplied by 3! because when you take the derivative of the interaction term with respect to the fields, you have 3! ways of contracting the three B's. Wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian is (g/3! ) AB\u00b3 to account for the permutations. But in the given problem, the interaction is written as gABCD in the first case and gAB\u00b3 in the second. So I need to check whether the coupling includes a combinatorial factor.\n\nWait, the given interaction term is gABCD, which is straightforward, but for gAB\u00b3, the term should really have a symmetry factor. When you have multiple identical fields in the interaction term, the coupling is usually divided by the number of permutations to avoid overcounting in Feynman diagrams. For example, a \u03c6\u00b3 interaction is written as (g/3!) \u03c6\u00b3, so that the vertex factor is -i g without extra factors. But in this problem, the interaction term is given as gAB\u00b3. Therefore, the vertex factor would be -i g multiplied by the number of permutations of the three B legs. Since each B is identical, each way of connecting the three B's in the Feynman diagram would be considered the same, so the vertex factor is -i g multiplied by 3! = 6? Or is it just -i g?\n\nWait, let's clarify. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is L_int = g AB\u00b3. The term AB\u00b3 has four fields: one A and three B's, which are identical. Therefore, when we compute the Feynman rules, the vertex factor is obtained by taking (i times) the coefficient from the Lagrangian, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the fields. For example, for a \u03c6\u2074 interaction term (\u03bb/4!) \u03c6\u2074, the vertex factor is -i \u03bb. Similarly, for the term g AB\u00b3, when you take the derivative of the interaction term with respect to A, B, B, B, the coefficient would be g * 3! because differentiating three times with respect to B gives a factor of 3!. So the vertex factor is -i g * 3!.\n\nAlternatively, if the interaction term is written as (g/3!) AB\u00b3, then the vertex factor is -i g. But the problem states the interaction is gAB\u00b3, so the term is written as g AB\u00b3. Therefore, the vertex factor should be -i g * 3! because when you compute the Feynman rule, for each permutation of the three B legs, you have to account for the combinatorial factor. For example, in \u03c6\u00b3 theory, the interaction term is (g/3!) \u03c6\u00b3, so the vertex factor is -i g. Here, since the term is not divided by 3!, the vertex factor would actually be -i g multiplied by 3!.\n\nBut this is a crucial point because it affects the matrix element. So if the interaction term is gAB\u00b3, then the vertex factor is -i g * 3! because when you have three identical B particles, each permutation in the legs contributes, hence the factor of 3!.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem doesn't include the factorial, so in the Lagrangian, it's written as gAB\u00b3, which would imply that the vertex factor is -i g, and when calculating the amplitude, you need to multiply by the number of identical particles in the final state. Wait, no. The vertex factor is determined by the term in the Lagrangian. The term gAB\u00b3 implies that the coefficient is g, and when you take the functional derivatives for the Feynman rules, you get a factor of 3! from the three B fields. So the vertex factor would be -i g * 3!.\n\nFor example, if you have a term like (1/3!) g AB\u00b3, then the vertex factor would be -i g. But if the term is written as g AB\u00b3, then it's as if you have three B's without the factorial, so the vertex factor would be -i g * 3!.\n\nThis is important because it changes the matrix element. Therefore, the amplitude M for the decay A \u2192 B + B + B would have a factor of 3! from the vertex, leading to |M|\u00b2 = (3! g)^2 = 36 g\u00b2.\n\nBut in addition, when calculating the decay width, if the final state has identical particles, you need to divide by the symmetry factor. For three identical B particles, the symmetry factor is 3! = 6. Therefore, the decay width would be:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * \u222b |M|\u00b2 d\u03a6_3 / 3!\n\nSo combining these factors, the |M|\u00b2 is (3! g)^2 = 36 g\u00b2, but the phase space integral is divided by 3! due to identical particles. Therefore, the net factor is 36 g\u00b2 / 6 = 6 g\u00b2.\n\nThen, the decay width would be:\n\n\u0393 = (6 g\u00b2)/(2 m_A) * \u03a6_3 = (3 g\u00b2/m_A) * \u03a6_3\n\nBut \u03a6_3 in this case is the three-body phase space for three identical particles. Wait, no. The \u03a6_3 is the same as before, but since the particles are identical, the integration region is reduced. However, in the standard phase space integral, the integral is over all possible momenta, but when particles are identical, we must divide by the symmetry factor to account for indistinguishable configurations. Therefore, the total decay width would be:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * |M|\u00b2 * (\u03a6_3 / 3!)\n\nWhich comes out to:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * ( (3! g)^2 ) * (\u03a6_3 / 3! )\n\n= (1/(2 m_A)) * ( 3! g\u00b2 ) * \u03a6_3\n\n= (6 g\u00b2)/(2 m_A) ) * \u03a6_3\n\n= (3 g\u00b2/m_A) ) * \u03a6_3\n\nNow, substituting \u03a6_3 from before as m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3}), we get:\n\n\u0393 = (3 g\u00b2/m_A) * (m_A\u00b2)/(256 \u03c0^3}) )= (3 g\u00b2 m_A)/(256 \u03c0^3})\n\nBut wait, this is different from the first case. In the first case, the answer was \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3). In this case, with the interaction gAB\u00b3, the decay width becomes \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3) = (3/512 * 2) ) g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3) \u2192 Simplifies to 3/(256 \u03c0\u00b3) g\u00b2 m_A.\n\nAlternatively, let me double-check. Wait, \u03a6_3 is the same as before, but with three identical particles, the phase space integral would have a factor of 1/3! if the particles are identical. However, when calculating \u03a6_3, the standard phase space integral counts all possible distinct momentum configurations, and if the particles are identical, those configurations that differ only by permutation of the identical particles are considered the same physical state, so the integral must be divided by the number of permutations (3! for three identical particles). Therefore, when the final state has three identical particles, the phase space integral is \u03a6_3 / 3!.\n\nBut in our case, the first scenario had B, C, D as distinct particles, so the phase space integral was \u03a6_3. The second scenario has three B particles, which are identical, so the phase space integral is \u03a6_3 / 3!.\n\nHowever, the matrix element squared must also account for the fact that the vertex has three B legs. If the interaction is gAB\u00b3, then the vertex factor is -i g * 3! as discussed earlier. So |M|\u00b2 = (3! g)^2 = 36 g\u00b2. Therefore, combining these factors:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * |M|\u00b2 * (\u03a6_3 / 3!) = (1/(2 m_A)) * 36 g\u00b2 * (\u03a6_3 / 6) ) = (1/(2 m_A)) * 6 g\u00b2 * \u03a6_3 = (3 g\u00b2/m_A) * \u03a6_3.\n\nNow, substituting \u03a6_3 = m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3}), we get:\n\n\u0393 = 3 g\u00b2/m_A * m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3) = 3 g\u00b2 m_A/(256 \u03c0^3)\n\nSo comparing to the first case where \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A/(512 \u03c0^3}, in the second case, the answer is 6 times larger (since 3/256 = 6/512).\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nFirst case: \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nSecond case: \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3) ) = 6 * (g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)) )\n\nSimplifying, the answer for the interaction gABCD is g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3), and for gAB\u00b3, it's 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3).\n\nBut I need to confirm the phase space factor again. Let's say \u03a6_3 is m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3). Then for the first case:\n\n\u0393 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * (m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0\u00b3)) = g\u00b2 m_A/(512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor the second case:\n\n\u0393 = ( (3! g)^2 / (2 m_A) ) * (1/3!) * (m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0\u00b3)) )\n\nWait, no. Let's re-express this. The matrix element is M = -i 3! g, so |M|\u00b2 = (3! g)^2 = 36 g\u00b2. The phase space integral for three identical particles is \u03a6_3 / 3! = (m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0\u00b3)) / 6.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * 36 g\u00b2 * (m_A\u00b2)/(256 \u03c0\u00b3 * 6)\n\n= (1/(2 m_A)) * 36/6 g\u00b2 m_A\u00b2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\n= (6 g\u00b2 m_A) / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\n= (3 g\u00b2 m_A) / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nWhich matches the previous result.\n\nSo for the second interaction term, the decay width is three times larger than if the particles were distinct. But wait, in the first case, the phase space was for three distinct particles, while in the second case, with three identical particles, the phase space is reduced by 3!, but the matrix element squared is increased by (3!)^2, leading to a net factor of 3!.\n\nSo the second answer is \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nFirst case: \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nSecond case: \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nBut let me check the numerical factors once more. For the first case:\n\n\u03a6_3 = m_A^2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\n\u0393 = (g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * (m_A^2 / 256 \u03c0\u00b3) = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor the second case:\n\nM = -i g * 3! \u2192 |M|\u00b2 = 36 g\u00b2\n\nBut the phase space is \u03a6_3 / 3! = m_A^2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3 * 6)\n\nSo \u0393 = (36 g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * (m_A^2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3 * 6)) ) = (36 g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * (m_A^2 / (1536 \u03c0\u00b3)) )\n\n= (36 g\u00b2 m_A ) / (3072 \u03c0\u00b3 )\n\n= (36 / 3072) * g\u00b2 m_A / \u03c0\u00b3\n\nSimplify 36/3072 = 3/256\n\nSo \u0393 = (3/256) g\u00b2 m_A / \u03c0\u00b3 )\n\nYes, this matches. So the decay width for the second interaction is (3 g\u00b2 m_A) / (256 \u03c0\u00b3).\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nFor interaction gABCD: \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor interaction gAB\u00b3: \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. Since the interaction term gAB\u00b3 could have a different vertex factor based on how the term is written. Suppose the interaction is written as g A B\u00b3, then when expanding in perturbation theory, the coefficient of the term would be g/3! due to the permutations of the three B fields. So the vertex factor would actually be -i g / 3! for each term. But the problem states that the interaction is gAB\u00b3, which suggests that the term is written without the 3!, so the vertex factor would be -i g multiplied by 3!.\n\nBut this depends on the convention used in the problem. If the Lagrangian term is written as gAB\u00b3, without the factorial, then the vertex factor would be -i g * 3!.\n\nHowever, in many textbooks, when writing interaction terms with multiple identical fields, the factorial is included to account for permutations. For example, \u03bb \u03c6\u2074 would be written as (\u03bb/4!) \u03c6\u2074, so that the vertex factor is -i \u03bb. If the problem does not include the factorial in the interaction term, then the vertex factor will include the factorial. This is a critical point because it directly affects the matrix element.\n\nAssuming that the problem follows the convention where the interaction term is written without the factorial (i.e., gAB\u00b3), then the vertex factor is indeed -i g * 3!.\n\nHowever, if the term had been written as g/6 AB\u00b3 (since 3! = 6), then the vertex factor would be -i g. But the problem states the interaction is gAB\u00b3, so the former applies.\n\nThus, the answer for the second part is \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3} )\n\nSumming up:\n\nFirst case: \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nSecond case: \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nNow, to type the answers properly:\n\nThe first answer is g\u00b2 m_A over 512 \u03c0\u00b3, and the second is 3 g\u00b2 m_A over 256 \u03c0\u00b3.\n\nBut let me double-check the factors once more. For the first case:\n\n\u03a6_3 = m_A\u00b2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\n\u0393 = (g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * \u03a6_3 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor the second case:\n\n\u0393 = [ (3! g)^2 / (2 m_A) ) ] * (\u03a6_3 / 3!) ) = (36 g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * (m_A\u00b2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3 * 6)) ) = (36 g\u00b2 m_A) / (3072 \u03c0\u00b3) ) = (3 g\u00b2 m_A) / (256 \u03c0\u00b3) )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nFirst interaction (gABCD): \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nSecond interaction (gAB\u00b3): \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nNow, to present these in the boxed notation as per the instructions.\n\nBut the question asks to compute the total decay width of A for both cases. So the user wants two answers.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Compute, to the lowest non-vanishing order of perturbation theory, the total decay width of the A. What would the answer be if the interaction were instead gAB^3?\"\n\nTherefore, the first answer is for gABCD, and the second for gAB\u00b3.\n\nSo the answers are:\n\nFor gABCD: \u0393 = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor gAB\u00b3: \u0393 = (3 g\u00b2 m_A)/(256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nAlternatively, simplifying the second case:\n\n3/256 is the same as 6/512, so \u0393 = 6(g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0\u00b3) = 6 times the first case. But perhaps the first case is written as (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0\u00b3), and the second as (3 g\u00b2 m_A)/(256 \u03c0\u00b3).\n\nYes, which is the same.\n\nNow, to check if there are any other factors. For example, in the amplitude squared, sometimes you have factors from polarization sums or spin-averaging, but since we're dealing with scalars, there are no such factors. The matrix element is simply g (times any symmetry factors), so the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I think the answers are as derived.\n</think>\n\nExplanation:  \nTo compute the decay width of particle \\( A \\) in both interaction cases, we start with the general formula for decay width \\( \\Gamma = \\frac{1}{2m_A} \\int |\\mathcal{M}|^2 d\\Phi \\), where \\( d\\Phi \\) is the phase space.  \n\n**Case 1: Interaction \\( gABCD \\)**  \n- The matrix element \\( |\\mathcal{M}|^2 = g^2 \\), as the vertex has distinct fields (no symmetry factors).  \n- The three-body phase space for massless final states is \\( \\Phi_3 = \\frac{m_A^2}{256\\pi^3} \\).  \n- Substituting: \\( \\Gamma = \\frac{g^2}{2m_A} \\cdot \\frac{m_A^2}{256\\pi^3} = \\frac{g^2 m_A}{512\\pi^3} \\).  \n\n**Case 2: Interaction \\( gAB^3 \\)**  \n- Here, \\( B \\) is identical in the final state.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the decay width of a scalar particle A into three other scalars B, C, and D. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is gABCD. Then we also need to consider the case where the interaction is gAB\u00b3 instead. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the decay width is calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule or, more formally, using the formula from quantum field theory. For a decay process A \u2192 B + C + D (or A \u2192 three particles), the decay width \u0393 is given by the matrix element squared, integrated over the phase space of the final state particles.\n\nThe general formula is \u0393 = (1/(2m_A)) * \u222b |M|\u00b2 d\u03a6, where d\u03a6 is the phase space element. Since we're working at the lowest non-vanishing order in perturbation theory, we need to look at the Feynman diagram that contributes to this process. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is gABCD, so the vertex connecting A, B, C, D has a coupling constant g. Therefore, the leading-order diagram for A decaying into B, C, D is a tree-level diagram with one vertex. The matrix element M should just be g (times some factors from the Feynman rules), because it's a tree-level process with a single vertex.\n\nWait, scalar particles... So the Feynman rule for a quartic vertex like ABCD would be -ig (since the interaction term is +gABCD in the Lagrangian, and the vertex factor is -i times the coupling). But in the decay amplitude, we have to include this vertex factor. So the matrix element M is -i g. However, when calculating |M|\u00b2, the i's would square to -1 and give us |M|\u00b2 = g\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a symmetry factor here? Let's think. The interaction term is gABCD, meaning that all four fields are different. So when calculating the vertex, there's no symmetry factors to consider because all particles are distinct. So the amplitude is just -i g, leading to |M|\u00b2 = g\u00b2.\n\nNow, the decay width \u0393 is (1/(2m_A)) * (\u222b |M|\u00b2 d\u03a6). The phase space integral for a three-body decay in the rest frame of A is more complicated than for two-body. But perhaps, since all the outgoing particles are massless (B, C, D are massless), the calculation simplifies?\n\nWait, the problem states that A is massive (mass m), and B, C, D are massless. So the decay is A \u2192 B + C + D. The phase space integral for three massless particles might have some simplifications.\n\nBut three-body phase space integrals can be tricky. Let me recall the general formula for the decay width. In the center-of-mass frame of A, the total energy is m_A, and the three outgoing particles (massless) will each have energies E1, E2, E3 such that E1 + E2 + E3 = m_A. Also, their momenta vectors should add up to zero.\n\nBut the exact integral requires evaluating something like \u222b \u03b4^4(p_A - p1 - p2 - p3) [d^3 p1/(2E1)] [d^3 p2/(2E2)] [d^3 p3/(2E3)].\n\nBut this is complicated. However, maybe there is a standard result for the three-body phase space when all the outgoing particles are massless. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to approximate it or relate it to a dimensionless integral.\n\nAlternatively, since all outgoing particles are massless, maybe we can use dimensional analysis. The decay width \u0393 has dimensions of energy. The coupling g has dimensions. Let's check the dimensions. The Lagrangian term gABCD has to have dimensions of [mass]^4 (since the Lagrangian density has dimensions [mass]^4 in natural units where \u0127=c=1). Each scalar field has dimension [mass]^1 (since the kinetic term (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)^2 has [mass]^4, so \u03c6 must be [mass]^1). Therefore, g has dimension [mass]^0 (because [g][A][B][C][D] = [g][mass]^4 = [mass]^4 \u2192 [g] = [mass]^0, i.e., dimensionless). Wait, but that's in 4-dimensional spacetime? Wait, in 4 dimensions, the scalar fields have dimension [mass]^{(4-2)/2} = [mass]^1. So when you multiply four scalar fields, each of dimension 1, the product has dimension 4. The Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so g must be dimensionless. So yes, g is dimensionless. So \u0393, which has dimensions of mass, would be proportional to g\u00b2 m_A, since m_A is the only mass scale in the problem (since B, C, D are massless). But wait, \u0393 has to have units of mass. So \u0393 ~ g\u00b2 m_A. But with possible numerical factors from the phase space integral.\n\nIn the case of a three-body decay, the phase space integral for massless particles... I think there's a standard result. For example, in the decay of a muon into three electrons, but that's a different process. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the three-body phase space. For three massless particles, the integral simplifies. Let me recall that for a three-body decay of a particle of mass M into three massless particles, the total phase space volume (without considering the matrix element) is proportional to M\u00b2/(256 \u03c0\u00b3). Wait, perhaps? Let me check. The general formula for the three-body phase space (in 4 dimensions) is:\n\nd\u03a6 = (1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * (1/(32 M)) * \u222b ds dt,\n\nwhere s and t are Mandelstam variables, but this might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, in the case where all three particles are massless, the integral can be done in terms of the angles between the particles. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that the total three-body phase space for massless decay products is (M^2)/(256 \u03c0^3).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think differently. For a two-body decay into massless particles, the phase space is much simpler. For example, the decay width for a particle of mass M into two massless particles (assuming a matrix element that's constant) would be \u0393 = (g\u00b2)/(16 \u03c0 M), but that's for two-body. For three-body, the phase space integral would have more integrals. But perhaps when the matrix element is constant (as in our case, since M = g), the integral can be evaluated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula from particle physics. For a three-body decay with a constant matrix element, the decay width \u0393 is given by (g\u00b2)/(2 m_A) multiplied by the three-body phase space. And the three-body phase space for massless particles would be proportional to m_A\u00b2/(something). Let me recall that in the case where all three particles are massless, the phase space integral can be found using the formula:\n\n\u03a6_3 = (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3)}.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the three-body phase space integral for massless particles. The general formula for the differential phase space is:\n\nd\u03a6_3 = (1/(2\u03c0))^3 (d^3 p1/(2 E1)) (d^3 p2/(2 E2)) (d^3 p3/(2 E3)) \u03b4^4(p_A - p1 - p2 - p3)\n\nIn the rest frame of A, p_A = (m_A, 0, 0, 0). The three outgoing particles have energies E1, E2, E3, with E1 + E2 + E3 = m_A, and their momenta vectors sum to zero. Since they are massless, |p_i| = E_i.\n\nBut to compute this integral, one can first fix the momentum of particle 1, then particle 2, and particle 3 is determined by momentum conservation. However, this becomes complex. There's a method to compute the three-body phase space by using the invariant variables. Alternatively, using the formula for the total three-body phase space when the matrix element is constant.\n\nThe formula for the three-body decay phase space integral (without any matrix element dependence) can be found in textbooks. For example, in the PDG review or in Thomson's \"Modern Particle Physics\". According to Thomson, the three-body phase space for massless particles is:\n\n\u03a6_3 = (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3)}.\n\nBut I need to verify this. Let me try to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, let's parameterize the problem. For massless particles, each momentum vector has magnitude equal to their energy. Let me work in the center-of-mass frame. Let me use spherical coordinates for two of the particles and then relate the third. Alternatively, use the Dalitz plot approach. But maybe this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall that for the decay of a particle into three massless particles, the phase space integral is:\n\n\u03a6_3 = \u222b [d^3 p1/(2 E1 (2\u03c0)^3))] [d^3 p2/(2 E2 (2\u03c0)^3))] [d^3 p3/(2 E3 (2\u03c0)^3))] (2\u03c0)^4 \u03b4^4(p_A - p1 - p2 - p3)\n\nFactor out the (2\u03c0) factors: (1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * \u222b [d^3 p1 d^3 p2 d^3 p3)/(8 E1 E2 E3)] \u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - E3) \u03b4^3(p1 + p2 + p3)\n\nThis integral can be simplified by using the momentum delta function to fix p3 = -p1 -p2. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n(1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * \u222b [d^3 p1 d^3 p2)/(8 E1 E2 E3)] \u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - E3)\n\nBut E3 = |p3| = |p1 + p2|. For massless particles, E3 = |p1 + p2|. Let me switch to spherical coordinates for p1 and p2. But this still seems complicated. However, since all particles are massless, maybe there's a way to compute the integral by scaling variables. Let me consider variables x_i = E_i / m_A, so that x1 + x2 + x3 = 1. Then, the delta function becomes \u03b4(m_A (1 - x1 -x2 -x3)) ) / m_A.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider that for three massless particles, the integral over angles might factor out. Let me suppose that the matrix element is a constant (which it is in this case, since M = -i g, so |M|^2 = g^2). Then, the decay width \u0393 is (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * \u03a6_3, where \u03a6_3 is the three-body phase space integral.\n\nBut I need to find \u03a6_3. Let me recall that for three-body phase space with massless particles, the integral can be evaluated and the result is (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3). If that's the case, then \u0393 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3) ) = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0^3). But I'm not sure about the numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use dimensional analysis. Since \u0393 has units of mass, and the only parameters are g (dimensionless) and m_A (mass), then \u0393 must be proportional to g\u00b2 m_A. The numerical factor comes from the phase space integral. The answer would then be \u0393 = (g^2 m_A)/(something * (2\u03c0)^n), where something is a number from the phase space integration.\n\nAlternatively, I can check a standard decay process. For example, the decay rate for a Z boson into three massless neutrinos would be a similar process, but the matrix element would not be constant. However, in the case where the matrix element is a constant, the phase space would give the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up the formula for three-body phase space in the case of massless decay products and a constant matrix element. According to some references, the total decay width for a scalar decaying into three massless scalars with a coupling g is given by \u0393 = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0\u00b3)}. But I need to confirm the coefficient.\n\nWait, let's try to compute it. Let's start with the phase space integral:\n\n\u03a6_3 = \u222b [d^3 p1/(2 E1 (2\u03c0)^3))] [d^3 p2/(2 E2 (2\u03c0)^3))] [d^3 p3/(2 E3 (2\u03c0)^3))] (2\u03c0)^4 \u03b4^4(p_A - p1 - p2 - p3)\n\nFirst, notice that the integral is Lorentz invariant, so we can compute it in the rest frame of A. Then, p_A = (m_A, 0), and the three momenta p1, p2, p3 must satisfy p1 + p2 + p3 = 0 and E1 + E2 + E3 = m_A. For massless particles, E_i = |p_i|.\n\nWe can use the momentum-conservation delta function to eliminate p3. So set p3 = -p1 - p2. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n\u03a6_3 = (1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * \u222b [d^3 p1 d^3 p2)/(8 E1 E2 |p1 + p2|)] \u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - |p1 + p2|)\n\nThis is still complicated, but maybe we can use spherical coordinates. Let's express p1 and p2 in spherical coordinates. Let's first fix p1 in the z-direction, then p2 will have angles relative to p1. However, due to the symmetry, the integral should not depend on the direction of p1, so we can integrate over the angles of p2 relative to p1.\n\nLet me set p1 along the z-axis. Then, p1 = (0, 0, E1) (since E1 = |p1|). Then, p2 has spherical coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6), and its magnitude E2. Then, |p1 + p2| can be found using the cosine law: |p1 + p2|\u00b2 = E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between p1 and p2. Therefore, |p1 + p2| = sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 cos\u03b8) = E3.\n\nBut since we are dealing with massless particles, E3 must equal |p1 + p2|. The delta function becomes \u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 cos\u03b8)).\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can change variables. Let u = cos\u03b8. Then, the delta function is:\n\n\u03b4(m_A - E1 - E2 - sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u))\n\nLet me denote the argument of the delta function as f(u) = m_A - E1 - E2 - sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u). The integral over u can be done using the delta function. The root is solved when:\n\nsqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u) = m_A - E1 - E2\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nE1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u = (m_A - E1 - E2)^2 = m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A(E1 + E2) + (E1 + E2)^2\n\nExpanding the RHS:\n\n= m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A E1 - 2 m_A E2 + E1\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2\u00b2\n\nSetting equal to LHS:\n\nE1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u = m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A(E1 + E2) + E1\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2\u00b2\n\nCancel E1\u00b2 and E2\u00b2:\n\n2 E1 E2 u = m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A(E1 + E2) + 2 E1 E2\n\nSolving for u:\n\nu = [m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A(E1 + E2) + 2 E1 E2]/(2 E1 E2)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= m_A\u00b2 - 2 m_A E1 - 2 m_A E2 + 2 E1 E2\n\nBut the delta function \u03b4(f(u)) can be written as \u03b4(u - u0)/|f'(u0)|}, where u0 is the solution above.\n\nFirst, compute f'(u):\n\nf(u) = m_A - E1 - E2 - sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u)\n\ndf/du = - (1/(2 sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u))) ) * 2 E1 E2\n\n= - (E1 E2)/sqrt(E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 + 2 E1 E2 u)\n\nAt u = u0, sqrt(...) = m_A - E1 - E2\n\nTherefore, |df/du| at u0 is (E1 E2)/(m_A - E1 - E2)\n\nSo the delta function integral over u gives:\n\n\u03a6_3 becomes:\n\n(1/(2\u03c0)^5)) * \u222b [E1\u00b2 dE1 d\u03a91/(2 E1))] [E2\u00b2 dE2 d\u03a92/(2 E2))] [1/(8 E1 E2 |p1 + p2|))] * [ (m_A - E1 - E2)/ (E1 E2) ) ]^{-1} * \u03b4(...)\n\nWait, this is getting too involved. Let me try to proceed step by step.\n\nAfter integrating over u using the delta function, the remaining variables are E1, E2, and the angles, but due to the delta function, we have constraints. Also, note that the angles for p1 and p2 are integrated over. However, since we've fixed p1 along the z-axis and p2 in the corresponding spherical coordinates, the integral over \u03c6 (azimuthal angle) for p2 would be from 0 to 2\u03c0, and \u03b8 (polar angle) is replaced by the delta function.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use the following approach: since the problem is symmetric, the total phase space integral can be written in terms of the variables x1 = E1/m_A, x2 = E2/m_A, and x3 = E3/m_A, with x1 + x2 + x3 = 1. But since the particles are massless, E3 = |p3| = |p1 + p2|. However, this might not directly translate to a simple relation between x1 and x2.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral over the energies E1 and E2. For massless particles, the energy is the magnitude of the momentum, so the integration variables for each particle are E and solid angles. But after integrating over angles and using momentum conservation, the integral reduces to integrals over E1, E2, and the angle between them.\n\nBut this seems too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. For three-body phase space with massless particles, the integral over phase space is known to be:\n\n\u03a6_3 = (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3)}\n\nSo then \u0393 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3) ) = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0^3}\n\nBut I need to check where the factors come from. Let me see:\n\nThe amplitude squared is |M|^2 = g\u00b2. Then, the decay width is:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * \u222b |M|^2 d\u03a6_3 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * \u03a6_3\n\nIf \u03a6_3 = (m_A^2)/(256 \u03c0^3)}, then \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0^3)\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phase space is (m_A^2)/(128 \u03c0^3)}, leading to \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A/(256 \u03c0^3}\n\nBut I need to recall the exact expression. Let me think of an example: muon decay. However, muon decay has a matrix element that's not constant, so the phase space integral would be different. Alternatively, for a hypothetical scalar decaying into three massless scalars with a point interaction, the formula would have the phase space factor as (m_A^5)/(something). Wait, no, if the matrix element is constant, then \u0393 would be proportional to m_A.\n\nWait, actually, in scalar \u03c6\u2074 theory, the decay width of a particle into three others would have a certain dependence. But in this case, the problem is a \u03c6\u00b3 interaction? No, the interaction is ABCD, which is a four-scalar interaction. Wait, the interaction term is gABCD, which is a quartic term. Therefore, the vertex is four scalar particles. However, the decay is of A into B, C, D. So it's a three-body decay. Therefore, the vertex connects four particles, so one incoming (A) and three outgoing (B, C, D). Therefore, the matrix element is proportional to g, and the calculation proceeds as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a combinatorial factor. For example, in the case where the interaction term is gABCD, the number of ways to connect the fields in the vertex. But since all are distinct, there is no symmetry factor. The vertex factor is just -i g, and the Feynman rule gives that. Therefore, the amplitude is -i g, and |M|\u00b2 = g\u00b2.\n\nBut when calculating the decay width, one must also include the symmetry factor for identical particles in the final state. However, in this case, B, C, D are distinct fields. The problem states they are different (as they are labeled differently). Therefore, there's no symmetry factor. So the integral is as above.\n\nAssuming that \u03a6_3 = m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3)}, then the decay width \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A/(512 \u03c0^3}\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the numerical factor. Alternatively, maybe the phase space integral for three massless particles has a factor of 1/(256 \u03c0^3 m_A)}. Wait, no. Let me try to look up the formula for three-body phase space in 4 dimensions.\n\nAccording to some sources, the three-body phase space for massless particles can be written as:\n\n\u03a6_3 = \\frac{m_A^2}{256 \\pi^3}\n\nBut I need to confirm. Ok, let's proceed. So if \u03a6_3 = m_A^2/(256 \u03c0^3)}, then multiplying by |M|\u00b2/(2 m_A)}, which is g\u00b2/(2 m_A)}, gives \u0393 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * (m_A\u00b2)/(256 \u03c0^3)) = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0^3}\n\nSo that's the answer for the first part.\n\nNow, the second part asks about the interaction term being gAB\u00b3 instead. So the interaction is gAB\u00b3. Now, B is a real scalar field. So the term is gABBB. Therefore, the vertex would have one A and three B's. However, since B is a real scalar field, the interaction term is gAB\u00b3. So the Feynman rule for this vertex would have a coupling factor of -i g multiplied by the number of permutations for identical particles. But since all three B's are identical, the symmetry factor for the vertex is 3! = 6. Wait, no. The vertex factor for a term like gAB\u00b3 would be -i g multiplied by 3! because when you take the derivative of the interaction term with respect to the fields, you have 3! ways of contracting the three B's. Wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian is (g/3! ) AB\u00b3 to account for the permutations. But in the given problem, the interaction is written as gABCD in the first case and gAB\u00b3 in the second. So I need to check whether the coupling includes a combinatorial factor.\n\nWait, the given interaction term is gABCD, which is straightforward, but for gAB\u00b3, the term should really have a symmetry factor. When you have multiple identical fields in the interaction term, the coupling is usually divided by the number of permutations to avoid overcounting in Feynman diagrams. For example, a \u03c6\u00b3 interaction is written as (g/3!) \u03c6\u00b3, so that the vertex factor is -i g without extra factors. But in this problem, the interaction term is given as gAB\u00b3. Therefore, the vertex factor would be -i g multiplied by the number of permutations of the three B legs. Since each B is identical, each way of connecting the three B's in the Feynman diagram would be considered the same, so the vertex factor is -i g multiplied by 3! = 6? Or is it just -i g?\n\nWait, let's clarify. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is L_int = g AB\u00b3. The term AB\u00b3 has four fields: one A and three B's, which are identical. Therefore, when we compute the Feynman rules, the vertex factor is obtained by taking (i times) the coefficient from the Lagrangian, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the fields. For example, for a \u03c6\u2074 interaction term (\u03bb/4!) \u03c6\u2074, the vertex factor is -i \u03bb. Similarly, for the term g AB\u00b3, when you take the derivative of the interaction term with respect to A, B, B, B, the coefficient would be g * 3! because differentiating three times with respect to B gives a factor of 3!. So the vertex factor is -i g * 3!.\n\nAlternatively, if the interaction term is written as (g/3!) AB\u00b3, then the vertex factor is -i g. But the problem states the interaction is gAB\u00b3, so the term is written as g AB\u00b3. Therefore, the vertex factor should be -i g * 3! because when you compute the Feynman rule, for each permutation of the three B legs, you have to account for the combinatorial factor. For example, in \u03c6\u00b3 theory, the interaction term is (g/3!) \u03c6\u00b3, so the vertex factor is -i g. Here, since the term is not divided by 3!, the vertex factor would actually be -i g multiplied by 3!.\n\nBut this is a crucial point because it affects the matrix element. So if the interaction term is gAB\u00b3, then the vertex factor is -i g * 3! because when you have three identical B particles, each permutation in the legs contributes, hence the factor of 3!.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem doesn't include the factorial, so in the Lagrangian, it's written as gAB\u00b3, which would imply that the vertex factor is -i g, and when calculating the amplitude, you need to multiply by the number of identical particles in the final state. Wait, no. The vertex factor is determined by the term in the Lagrangian. The term gAB\u00b3 implies that the coefficient is g, and when you take the functional derivatives for the Feynman rules, you get a factor of 3! from the three B fields. So the vertex factor would be -i g * 3!.\n\nFor example, if you have a term like (1/3!) g AB\u00b3, then the vertex factor would be -i g. But if the term is written as g AB\u00b3, then it's as if you have three B's without the factorial, so the vertex factor would be -i g * 3!.\n\nThis is important because it changes the matrix element. Therefore, the amplitude M for the decay A \u2192 B + B + B would have a factor of 3! from the vertex, leading to |M|\u00b2 = (3! g)^2 = 36 g\u00b2.\n\nBut in addition, when calculating the decay width, if the final state has identical particles, you need to divide by the symmetry factor. For three identical B particles, the symmetry factor is 3! = 6. Therefore, the decay width would be:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * \u222b |M|\u00b2 d\u03a6_3 / 3!\n\nSo combining these factors, the |M|\u00b2 is (3! g)^2 = 36 g\u00b2, but the phase space integral is divided by 3! due to identical particles. Therefore, the net factor is 36 g\u00b2 / 6 = 6 g\u00b2.\n\nThen, the decay width would be:\n\n\u0393 = (6 g\u00b2)/(2 m_A) * \u03a6_3 = (3 g\u00b2/m_A) * \u03a6_3\n\nBut \u03a6_3 in this case is the three-body phase space for three identical particles. Wait, no. The \u03a6_3 is the same as before, but since the particles are identical, the integration region is reduced. However, in the standard phase space integral, the integral is over all possible momenta, but when particles are identical, we must divide by the symmetry factor to account for indistinguishable configurations. Therefore, the total decay width would be:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * |M|\u00b2 * (\u03a6_3 / 3!)\n\nWhich comes out to:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * ( (3! g)^2 ) * (\u03a6_3 / 3! )\n\n= (1/(2 m_A)) * ( 3! g\u00b2 ) * \u03a6_3\n\n= (6 g\u00b2)/(2 m_A) ) * \u03a6_3\n\n= (3 g\u00b2/m_A) ) * \u03a6_3\n\nNow, substituting \u03a6_3 from before as m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3}), we get:\n\n\u0393 = (3 g\u00b2/m_A) * (m_A\u00b2)/(256 \u03c0^3}) )= (3 g\u00b2 m_A)/(256 \u03c0^3})\n\nBut wait, this is different from the first case. In the first case, the answer was \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3). In this case, with the interaction gAB\u00b3, the decay width becomes \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3) = (3/512 * 2) ) g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3) \u2192 Simplifies to 3/(256 \u03c0\u00b3) g\u00b2 m_A.\n\nAlternatively, let me double-check. Wait, \u03a6_3 is the same as before, but with three identical particles, the phase space integral would have a factor of 1/3! if the particles are identical. However, when calculating \u03a6_3, the standard phase space integral counts all possible distinct momentum configurations, and if the particles are identical, those configurations that differ only by permutation of the identical particles are considered the same physical state, so the integral must be divided by the number of permutations (3! for three identical particles). Therefore, when the final state has three identical particles, the phase space integral is \u03a6_3 / 3!.\n\nBut in our case, the first scenario had B, C, D as distinct particles, so the phase space integral was \u03a6_3. The second scenario has three B particles, which are identical, so the phase space integral is \u03a6_3 / 3!.\n\nHowever, the matrix element squared must also account for the fact that the vertex has three B legs. If the interaction is gAB\u00b3, then the vertex factor is -i g * 3! as discussed earlier. So |M|\u00b2 = (3! g)^2 = 36 g\u00b2. Therefore, combining these factors:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * |M|\u00b2 * (\u03a6_3 / 3!) = (1/(2 m_A)) * 36 g\u00b2 * (\u03a6_3 / 6) ) = (1/(2 m_A)) * 6 g\u00b2 * \u03a6_3 = (3 g\u00b2/m_A) * \u03a6_3.\n\nNow, substituting \u03a6_3 = m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3}), we get:\n\n\u0393 = 3 g\u00b2/m_A * m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3) = 3 g\u00b2 m_A/(256 \u03c0^3)\n\nSo comparing to the first case where \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A/(512 \u03c0^3}, in the second case, the answer is 6 times larger (since 3/256 = 6/512).\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nFirst case: \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nSecond case: \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3) ) = 6 * (g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)) )\n\nSimplifying, the answer for the interaction gABCD is g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3), and for gAB\u00b3, it's 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3).\n\nBut I need to confirm the phase space factor again. Let's say \u03a6_3 is m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0^3). Then for the first case:\n\n\u0393 = (g\u00b2/(2 m_A)) * (m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0\u00b3)) = g\u00b2 m_A/(512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor the second case:\n\n\u0393 = ( (3! g)^2 / (2 m_A) ) * (1/3!) * (m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0\u00b3)) )\n\nWait, no. Let's re-express this. The matrix element is M = -i 3! g, so |M|\u00b2 = (3! g)^2 = 36 g\u00b2. The phase space integral for three identical particles is \u03a6_3 / 3! = (m_A\u00b2/(256 \u03c0\u00b3)) / 6.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\u0393 = (1/(2 m_A)) * 36 g\u00b2 * (m_A\u00b2)/(256 \u03c0\u00b3 * 6)\n\n= (1/(2 m_A)) * 36/6 g\u00b2 m_A\u00b2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\n= (6 g\u00b2 m_A) / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\n= (3 g\u00b2 m_A) / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nWhich matches the previous result.\n\nSo for the second interaction term, the decay width is three times larger than if the particles were distinct. But wait, in the first case, the phase space was for three distinct particles, while in the second case, with three identical particles, the phase space is reduced by 3!, but the matrix element squared is increased by (3!)^2, leading to a net factor of 3!.\n\nSo the second answer is \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nFirst case: \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nSecond case: \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nBut let me check the numerical factors once more. For the first case:\n\n\u03a6_3 = m_A^2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\n\u0393 = (g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * (m_A^2 / 256 \u03c0\u00b3) = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor the second case:\n\nM = -i g * 3! \u2192 |M|\u00b2 = 36 g\u00b2\n\nBut the phase space is \u03a6_3 / 3! = m_A^2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3 * 6)\n\nSo \u0393 = (36 g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * (m_A^2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3 * 6)) ) = (36 g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * (m_A^2 / (1536 \u03c0\u00b3)) )\n\n= (36 g\u00b2 m_A ) / (3072 \u03c0\u00b3 )\n\n= (36 / 3072) * g\u00b2 m_A / \u03c0\u00b3\n\nSimplify 36/3072 = 3/256\n\nSo \u0393 = (3/256) g\u00b2 m_A / \u03c0\u00b3 )\n\nYes, this matches. So the decay width for the second interaction is (3 g\u00b2 m_A) / (256 \u03c0\u00b3).\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nFor interaction gABCD: \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor interaction gAB\u00b3: \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. Since the interaction term gAB\u00b3 could have a different vertex factor based on how the term is written. Suppose the interaction is written as g A B\u00b3, then when expanding in perturbation theory, the coefficient of the term would be g/3! due to the permutations of the three B fields. So the vertex factor would actually be -i g / 3! for each term. But the problem states that the interaction is gAB\u00b3, which suggests that the term is written without the 3!, so the vertex factor would be -i g multiplied by 3!.\n\nBut this depends on the convention used in the problem. If the Lagrangian term is written as gAB\u00b3, without the factorial, then the vertex factor would be -i g * 3!.\n\nHowever, in many textbooks, when writing interaction terms with multiple identical fields, the factorial is included to account for permutations. For example, \u03bb \u03c6\u2074 would be written as (\u03bb/4!) \u03c6\u2074, so that the vertex factor is -i \u03bb. If the problem does not include the factorial in the interaction term, then the vertex factor will include the factorial. This is a critical point because it directly affects the matrix element.\n\nAssuming that the problem follows the convention where the interaction term is written without the factorial (i.e., gAB\u00b3), then the vertex factor is indeed -i g * 3!.\n\nHowever, if the term had been written as g/6 AB\u00b3 (since 3! = 6), then the vertex factor would be -i g. But the problem states the interaction is gAB\u00b3, so the former applies.\n\nThus, the answer for the second part is \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3} )\n\nSumming up:\n\nFirst case: \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nSecond case: \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nNow, to type the answers properly:\n\nThe first answer is g\u00b2 m_A over 512 \u03c0\u00b3, and the second is 3 g\u00b2 m_A over 256 \u03c0\u00b3.\n\nBut let me double-check the factors once more. For the first case:\n\n\u03a6_3 = m_A\u00b2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\n\u0393 = (g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * \u03a6_3 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor the second case:\n\n\u0393 = [ (3! g)^2 / (2 m_A) ) ] * (\u03a6_3 / 3!) ) = (36 g\u00b2 / (2 m_A)) * (m_A\u00b2 / (256 \u03c0\u00b3 * 6)) ) = (36 g\u00b2 m_A) / (3072 \u03c0\u00b3) ) = (3 g\u00b2 m_A) / (256 \u03c0\u00b3) )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nFirst interaction (gABCD): \u0393 = g\u00b2 m_A / (512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nSecond interaction (gAB\u00b3): \u0393 = 3 g\u00b2 m_A / (256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nNow, to present these in the boxed notation as per the instructions.\n\nBut the question asks to compute the total decay width of A for both cases. So the user wants two answers.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Compute, to the lowest non-vanishing order of perturbation theory, the total decay width of the A. What would the answer be if the interaction were instead gAB^3?\"\n\nTherefore, the first answer is for gABCD, and the second for gAB\u00b3.\n\nSo the answers are:\n\nFor gABCD: \u0393 = (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nFor gAB\u00b3: \u0393 = (3 g\u00b2 m_A)/(256 \u03c0\u00b3)\n\nAlternatively, simplifying the second case:\n\n3/256 is the same as 6/512, so \u0393 = 6(g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0\u00b3) = 6 times the first case. But perhaps the first case is written as (g\u00b2 m_A)/(512 \u03c0\u00b3), and the second as (3 g\u00b2 m_A)/(256 \u03c0\u00b3).\n\nYes, which is the same.\n\nNow, to check if there are any other factors. For example, in the amplitude squared, sometimes you have factors from polarization sums or spin-averaging, but since we're dealing with scalars, there are no such factors. The matrix element is simply g (times any symmetry factors), so the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I think the answers are as derived.",
