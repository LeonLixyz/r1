  "question": "How many topologically distinct compact metric spaces $X$ are there with the property that $X,X^2,X^3, \\ldots$ are all homeomorphic?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The question is asking how many topologically distinct compact metric spaces X exist such that X, X\u00b2, X\u00b3, and so on are all homeomorphic. Hmm. So each power of X is homeomorphic to the original space. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a homeomorphism is. A homeomorphism is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse. So if X and X\u00b2 are homeomorphic, there's a bijection between them that preserves the topological structure. Similarly for higher powers.\n\nNow, I need to think of examples of spaces where this might hold. The first thing that comes to mind is a singleton space. If X is just a single point, then X\u00b2 is also a single point, and all powers are the same. So that works. Is that the only one?\n\nWait, what about the Cantor set? I remember something about the Cantor set being homeomorphic to its square. Let me check. The Cantor set C has the property that C \u00d7 C is homeomorphic to C. So if that's the case, then all finite products would be homeomorphic to C. So then X = Cantor set would satisfy X^n \u2248 X for all n, hence all powers are homeomorphic. So that's another example.\n\nAre there any others? Let's think. What about finite discrete spaces? Suppose X has two points. Then X\u00b2 is a four-point discrete space. These are not homeomorphic unless the number of points is the same, which would only happen if X is a singleton. So the only finite case is the singleton.\n\nBut the Cantor set is an infinite compact metric space. Are there other infinite spaces with this property?\n\nAnother thought: the Hilbert cube. The Hilbert cube is a product of countably many intervals [0,1], and it's known that the Hilbert cube is homeomorphic to its own square. But wait, is the Hilbert cube compact? Yes, it's compact by Tychonoff's theorem since it's a product of compact spaces. But does every power of the Hilbert cube stay homeomorphic to itself? If Q is the Hilbert cube, then Q\u00b2 is homeomorphic to Q, since Q \u00d7 Q is again a countably infinite product of intervals. So, in general, any infinite product that's \"stable\" under taking finite products. But wait, the problem here is about finite products. The question says X, X\u00b2, X\u00b3, etc. So each X^n is a finite product. For the Hilbert cube, X would be the Hilbert cube, but X\u00b2 is the product of two Hilbert cubes. Wait, but the Hilbert cube itself is already a product of infinitely many intervals. So Q \u00d7 Q would be a product of countably many intervals squared? Wait, no. The Hilbert cube is [0,1]^N, the product of countably many copies of [0,1]. Then Q \u00d7 Q would be [0,1]^N \u00d7 [0,1]^N, which is homeomorphic to [0,1]^{N + N} = [0,1]^N, since the union of countably many and countably many is still countably many. Therefore, Q \u00d7 Q is homeomorphic to Q. So the Hilbert cube does satisfy that X and X\u00b2 are homeomorphic. Similarly for higher powers. So that's another example.\n\nBut wait, the Hilbert cube is a compact metric space. So then, we have at least three examples: the singleton, the Cantor set, and the Hilbert cube. Wait, but maybe there are more?\n\nWait, but I need to check if there are any other spaces with this property. Let's think. What about the space being a finite set with the discrete topology? As I thought earlier, only the singleton works. For any finite discrete space with more than one point, the product would have more points, so not homeomorphic.\n\nWhat about the circle S\u00b9? Then S\u00b9 squared is the torus. The torus is not homeomorphic to the circle because their fundamental groups are different. So that's out.\n\nWhat about the unit interval [0,1]? Then [0,1]^2 is the square. These are not homeomorphic because removing a point can disconnect the interval but not the square. So that's not homeomorphic.\n\nHow about the Sierpinski space? Wait, not sure. Maybe not relevant here.\n\nAnother candidate: the pseudo-arc. Hmm, but I don't remember properties of the pseudo-arc regarding its products. Probably not necessary here.\n\nWait, so let's recap. So far, we have:\n\n1. The singleton space.\n\n2. The Cantor set.\n\n3. The Hilbert cube.\n\nEach of these has the property that their finite products are homeomorphic to themselves. Are there any others?\n\nI need to check if there are other known examples. Let me think. The Cantor set is a zero-dimensional compact metric space, and the Hilbert cube is a universal space for compact metric spaces, being infinite-dimensional.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe spaces that are infinite products of themselves. For instance, if X is homeomorphic to X \u00d7 X, then inductively, all X^n would be homeomorphic to X. But in the problem statement, the question is about X being compact metric. So such a space X must be compact metric and X \u2248 X \u00d7 X.\n\nSo the Cantor set and the Hilbert cube satisfy X \u2248 X \u00d7 X. The singleton also trivially does.\n\nAre there others? Let me think.\n\nWhat about the space being a finite product of such spaces? For example, if X is the product of the Cantor set and the Hilbert cube. Then X \u00d7 X would be the product of Cantor\u00b2 and Hilbert\u00b2, which are homeomorphic to Cantor and Hilbert respectively, so X \u00d7 X \u2248 X. But is X itself compact metric? Yes, as the product of compact metric spaces is compact metrizable (if countable). But in this case, the product of Cantor (which is compact metric) and Hilbert cube (compact metric) is also compact metrizable. But then X would be Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert cube. But does this space satisfy X \u2248 X \u00d7 X? Let's see: X \u00d7 X = (Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert) \u00d7 (Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert) = Cantor\u00b2 \u00d7 Hilbert\u00b2 \u2248 Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert. So yes, because Cantor\u00b2 \u2248 Cantor and Hilbert\u00b2 \u2248 Hilbert. Therefore, X \u00d7 X \u2248 X. So this product space would also satisfy the condition. But is this space homeomorphic to either Cantor, Hilbert cube, or the singleton? Probably not. The Cantor set is zero-dimensional, Hilbert cube is infinite-dimensional, and their product would be a space that is not zero-dimensional (since Hilbert cube is not) nor a Hilbert cube itself. Wait, but is the product of Cantor and Hilbert cube homeomorphic to Hilbert cube? Hmm. The Hilbert cube is universal for compact metric spaces, so any compact metric space embeds into it. But not sure if the product would be homeomorphic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product of Cantor and Hilbert cube is a new example. But if so, then this would imply there are infinitely many such spaces. But that contradicts the possibility that the answer is 3. Wait, but maybe such products are not distinct. For example, is Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert cube homeomorphic to either Cantor or Hilbert? Let's see. The Hilbert cube is infinite-dimensional, while Cantor is zero-dimensional. Their product would be a space that is not zero-dimensional (since Hilbert cube is a factor) and not purely infinite-dimensional in the same way as Hilbert cube. But I might need to check specific properties. For example, the Hilbert cube has the property that it is homeomorphic to its own square. But does Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert cube have the same property?\n\nLet me compute (Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert) \u00d7 (Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert) = Cantor\u00b2 \u00d7 Hilbert\u00b2 \u2248 Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert. So yes, because Cantor\u00b2 \u2248 Cantor and Hilbert\u00b2 \u2248 Hilbert. Therefore, the product space X = Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert would satisfy X^n \u2248 X for any n. But is X a distinct space from the Cantor set and the Hilbert cube? If X is not homeomorphic to either of them, then that would be another example. So perhaps there are infinitely many such spaces. But the problem states \"compact metric spaces\", so maybe there are infinitely many non-homeomorphic examples.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for \"how many topologically distinct\" such spaces. If there are infinitely many, the answer would be infinitely many, but maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but maybe the product examples I mentioned are actually homeomorphic to one of the known examples. For example, is Cantor \u00d7 Hilbert cube homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube? If the Hilbert cube is a factor, then the product of Hilbert cube with any compact metric space is homeomorphic to Hilbert cube. Wait, is that a theorem? Let me recall. There's a theorem called the \"factor theorem\" for the Hilbert cube, which states that if X is a compact metric space, then X \u00d7 Q \u2248 Q (where Q is the Hilbert cube). So if X is compact metric, then X \u00d7 Q is homeomorphic to Q. So in that case, if we take X = Q, then Q \u00d7 Q \u2248 Q. Similarly, if X is any compact metric space, then X \u00d7 Q \u2248 Q. So if we take X = Cantor \u00d7 Q, then X \u00d7 X \u2248 (Cantor \u00d7 Q) \u00d7 (Cantor \u00d7 Q) \u2248 Cantor\u00b2 \u00d7 Q\u00b2 \u2248 Cantor \u00d7 Q. So X \u00d7 X \u2248 X. Therefore, X is another example. But according to the factor theorem, X \u00d7 Q \u2248 Q, which would imply that X \u00d7 Q \u2248 Q \u2248 Q. But here, X itself is Cantor \u00d7 Q. But by the factor theorem, Cantor \u00d7 Q is homeomorphic to Q, because Q \u00d7 any compact metric space is homeomorphic to Q. Therefore, Cantor \u00d7 Q \u2248 Q. Therefore, X = Cantor \u00d7 Q \u2248 Q, which is the Hilbert cube. Therefore, in that case, the product is already homeomorphic to Q. Therefore, there are not new examples from taking products with Q. So perhaps X \u00d7 Q \u2248 Q for any compact metric X. Therefore, if we take X to be Q itself, then X \u00d7 X \u2248 Q. So Q is an example. If we take X to be the Cantor set, then X \u00d7 X \u2248 X. So the Cantor set is another example. The singleton is a third example.\n\nWait, but if X is the Cantor set, and Q is the Hilbert cube, then are there other examples? Let's think. Suppose X is any compact metric space that is homeomorphic to X \u00d7 X. Then the singleton, Cantor set, and Hilbert cube are examples. But are there others?\n\nWait, another example: the space {0} \u222a {1/n | n \u2208 N} with the subspace topology from R. Is this space homeomorphic to its square? Probably not. The square would have countably many isolated points and more complex structure. Probably not homeomorphic.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the countably infinite discrete space. But that's not compact. So it's not a candidate.\n\nWhat about the one-point compactification of the natural numbers? That's a compact metric space. Let's call it X = N \u222a {\u221e}. Then X is compact. But X \u00d7 X would have a more complicated topology. For example, neighborhoods around (\u221e, \u221e) would require both coordinates to be near \u221e. Not sure if this space is homeomorphic to X. Probably not, since the product would have a different structure.\n\nSo maybe we need to stick with the known examples. Singleton, Cantor set, and Hilbert cube.\n\nWait, but according to some theorems, these might be the only ones. Let me recall. There's a theorem that says that every compact, metrizable, zero-dimensional space without isolated points is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. So if a space is compact, metric, zero-dimensional, perfect (no isolated points), then it's the Cantor set. So the Cantor set is unique in that class.\n\nThe Hilbert cube is a compact metric space that is a continuum (connected compact metric space), and it's characterized by certain properties, like being infinite-dimensional and having the property that it's homeomorphic to its own square. Similarly, there might be a uniqueness theorem for the Hilbert cube.\n\nSo if that is the case, then the only three possibilities are:\n\n1. The single point space.\n\n2. The Cantor set.\n\n3. The Hilbert cube.\n\nBecause these are the only compact metric spaces that are homeomorphic to their own squares (and hence to all their higher powers). The singleton is trivial. The Cantor set and the Hilbert cube are non-trivial. Any other space would either not be compact metric, or not satisfy X \u2248 X \u00d7 X.\n\nTherefore, the number of topologically distinct such spaces is 3. Hence, the answer should be 3, with confidence high because these are the standard examples and I can't think of any others.\n",
