  "question": "In the double scaling limit of the quartic tensor model, at what critical exponent does the term in the 1/N series diverge?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out at what critical exponent the term in the 1/N series diverges for the quartic tensor model in the double scaling limit. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what I know about tensor models and the double scaling limit. \n\nTensor models are generalizations of matrix models, used in quantum gravity and statistical mechanics. The quartic tensor model would have interactions that are fourth-order in the tensor fields. The double scaling limit usually involves taking the large N limit (where N is the size of the tensor) while tuning a coupling constant to a critical value, such that certain terms in the perturbative expansion remain significant. This is similar to the double scaling limits in matrix models where you balance the matrix size and the coupling constant to get continuum limits.\n\nIn matrix models, the double scaling limit often leads to critical exponents related to the string susceptibility or other universal properties. For tensor models, especially the quartic ones, the critical exponents might differ. The 1/N expansion in tensor models is organized in terms of the inverse of the size parameter N. When taking the double scaling limit, certain terms in this expansion (like leading terms or specific diagrams) might diverge unless the coupling is adjusted appropriately.\n\nThe critical exponent would determine how the coupling constant is scaled with N. If the term in the 1/N series diverges, that suggests that the scaling of the coupling isn't properly adjusted to suppress those terms. The critical exponent would be the value where this divergence occurs, indicating the boundary between convergence and divergence.\n\nFrom what I remember, in the quartic tensor model, the double scaling limit involves a critical exponent that's linked to the melonic diagrams, which dominate in the large N limit. Melons are specific Feynman diagrams that contribute most significantly. The critical exponent for the coupling might relate to the scaling of these diagrams. \n\nIn some papers I've read, the critical exponent for the quartic tensor model in the double scaling limit is 3. For instance, when you have a coupling constant scaled as g ~ (1/N^\u03b1), the critical value \u03b1 would be where the perturbation series terms blow up. For melonic dominance, I think the scaling is such that each melonic diagram contributes a factor that depends on N. Maybe each vertex contributes a certain power, and the number of propagators or faces gives another. \n\nAlternatively, considering the canonical example of matrix models where the critical exponent is 1/2 for the double scaling limit (like in the case of the Painlev\u00e9 equation). But tensor models, having higher dimensionality, would have different exponents. For a quartic interaction in a tensor model of rank D, maybe the critical exponent is related to D. Wait, quartic tensor models often consider rank-3 tensors (since higher rank tensors can have different behaviors). If it's a rank-3 tensor model with quartic interactions, then the critical exponent might be 3/2 or similar. But I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, in the context of the 1/N expansion for tensor models, the scaling of the coupling constant g is adjusted such that each melonic insertion is of order 1. For a quartic interaction, each vertex comes with a coupling g, and each melon would contribute a certain number of vertices and propagators. The idea is that in the double scaling limit, g is scaled with N so that the contribution from the melonic diagrams remains finite. \n\nSuppose each melonic diagram contributes a factor proportional to (g N^\u03b4)^k, where \u03b4 is some exponent. To have a non-trivial limit when N goes to infinity and g approaches a critical value, you set \u03b4 such that the combination g N^\u03b4 remains finite. That would imply that the critical exponent for g is \u03b4. If the original coupling is scaled as g ~ N^{-\u03b4}, then near criticality, you would have g approaching g_c with g - g_c ~ N^{-\u03b4}. \n\nIn the case of quartic tensor models, I think the critical exponent \u03b4 is 3. For example, in some references, the double scaling limit for the quartic tensor model involves scaling the coupling constant as g = g_c (1 - \u03bc N^{-3/2}), leading to a critical exponent of 3/2. Wait, that might be a different exponent. Alternatively, when considering the leading-order contributions from the melonic diagrams, each melon might contribute a factor of g N^3, so that the effective coupling is g N^3. To keep this finite in the large N limit, you set g ~ 1/N^3. Then, in the double scaling limit, you approach the critical coupling where the perturbation series diverges. So the critical exponent here would be 3, meaning that the coupling is scaled with N^{-3}. \n\nTherefore, if the question is asking at what critical exponent does the term in the 1/N series diverge, that would be when the exponent is such that the scaling of the coupling is not sufficient to suppress the terms. If the critical exponent is 3, then any term that scales as N^3 would diverge unless the coupling scales as 1/N^3. Therefore, the critical exponent is 3.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: In the quartic tensor model, the double scaling limit balances the large \\( N \\) limit with a critical tuning of the coupling constant.
