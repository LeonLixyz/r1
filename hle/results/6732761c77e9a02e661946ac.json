  "question": "What is the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which province or territory is closest to the Waskaganish gathering place that's outside of Quebec. Let's start by locating Waskaganish. I remember that Waskaganish is a Cree community in northern Quebec. It's situated along the James Bay coast. Now, Quebec is bordered by several provinces and territories. To the west of Quebec is Ontario. North of Quebec is the territory of Nunavut, which was part of the Northwest Territories until 1999. Also, to the east are Newfoundland and Labrador, but that's probably further away.\n\nSince Waskaganish is in northern Quebec near James Bay, which is part of Hudson Bay, I should look at the neighboring regions around that area. James Bay is bordered by Ontario to the west and Quebec to the east. So, if Waskaganish is on the Quebec side of James Bay, the closest province outside Quebec would be Ontario. But wait, I should confirm the exact location. Let me visualize a map. James Bay is south of Hudson Bay, and the western shore of James Bay is part of Ontario. The community of Waskaganish is on the southern end of James Bay in Quebec. Therefore, the closest province would be Ontario. Alternatively, could it be Manitoba? But Manitoba is further west beyond Ontario. Nunavut is to the north, but that's across Hudson Bay, which is a large body of water. The distance across the bay might be farther than the land border with Ontario. So between Ontario and Nunavut, Ontario is likely closer. Let me check approximate distances. If Waskaganish is near the coast, the straight-line distance to Ontario's border might be shorter than to Nunavut. For example, Moosonee in Ontario is on the other side of James Bay from Waskaganish. The distance between Waskaganish and Moosonee is probably around 100-200 km across the bay. Alternatively, the land border between Quebec and Ontario in that region might be nearby. But since Waskaganish is on the coast, maybe the closest point is across the bay to Ontario. Nunavut is north, but the distance from Waskaganish to the southern tip of Nunavut (which is on Baffin Island?) would be much longer. Alternatively, maybe the border between Quebec and Ontario is inland, so the closest point in Ontario would be along the coast of James Bay. So the answer is Ontario. Therefore, the closest province or territory outside Quebec is Ontario.\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: Waskaganish is a Cree community located on the southern shore of James Bay in northern Quebec. The western shore of James Bay is part of Ontario. While Nunavut lies to the north across Hudson Bay, the closest land border to Waskaganish is with Ontario, situated directly across James Bay. The straight-line distance to Ontario's coast is shorter than the distance to Nunavut's southern regions. \n\nAnswer: Ontario  \nConfidence: 95%",
