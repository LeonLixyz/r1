  "question": "How many positive definite even lattices are there of dimension 17 and determinant 2?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many positive definite even lattices exist in dimension 17 with determinant 2. Hmm, where do I start? Let me recall some concepts. \n\nFirst, a lattice is a free abelian group equipped with a positive definite symmetric bilinear form. An even lattice means that the norm of every vector (x,x) is an even integer. The determinant of the lattice is the determinant of its Gram matrix, which is the square of the volume of the fundamental domain. \n\nNow, for even lattices, especially in higher dimensions, the classification can be related to root systems or modular forms. But wait, dimension 17 is kind of a tricky number. I remember that in even dimensions, the theory of unimodular lattices (determinant 1) is more developed, like the E8 lattice in 8 dimensions. But here the determinant is 2, not 1, and the dimension is 17, which is odd. That complicates things.\n\nFor even lattices, the determinant must be congruent modulo certain numbers. Let me think. Since the lattice is even, the determinant should be congruent to \u00b11 modulo some value depending on the dimension? Or maybe it's related to the signature? Wait, for even unimodular lattices, the signature has to be divisible by 8. But this isn't unimodular since determinant is 2. So that condition doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the discriminant form. The determinant relates to the discriminant group's order, which is the determinant. The discriminant form is a quadratic form on the discriminant group. For an even lattice, the discriminant form has certain properties. In particular, if the lattice is even, then the discriminant form is even in some sense. \n\nBut how does this help count the number of lattices? Maybe the genus of a lattice is determined by its signature, determinant, and discriminant form. Then, if two lattices are in the same genus, they can be compared using the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula, which gives the mass (a weighted count) of lattices in the genus. If the mass is computable and happens to be 1, then there's only one lattice in that genus. \n\nWait, the question is about positive definite lattices. So we need to consider the genus of positive definite even lattices with determinant 2 in dimension 17. If the genus consists of only one isomorphism class, then the answer would be 1. But how can I check that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a theorem that states that in certain conditions, the genus contains only one class. For instance, in lower dimensions, sometimes there's uniqueness. But in higher dimensions, like 17, maybe there's more. Or perhaps determinant 2 is small enough that only a few lattices exist.\n\nAnother angle: determinant 2 implies that the discriminant group has order 2. The discriminant group is isomorphic to the dual lattice modulo the original lattice, so its order is the determinant. So the discriminant group here would be of order 2, hence isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 2 or a direct sum of smaller cyclic groups, but since 2 is prime, it's cyclic. Therefore, the discriminant group is cyclic of order 2. \n\nFor an even lattice, the discriminant form must satisfy certain conditions. The quadratic form q on the discriminant group Z/2Z takes values in Q/2Z. Since the lattice is even, for any element x in the dual lattice, (x,x) must be an integer. Wait, for an even lattice, the norms are even integers. So for x in the lattice, (x,x) is even. For x in the dual lattice, (x,x) can be a half-integer or integer? Hmm, not sure. \n\nBut the discriminant form q is defined by q(v + L) = (v,v) mod 2Z, where v is in the dual lattice. Since the original lattice is even, then for any v in the dual lattice, 2v is in the original lattice, so (2v, 2v) is an even integer. Therefore, (v,v) must be in (1/4)Z? Not sure. Let's think: If L is even, then (x,x) \u2208 2Z for x \u2208 L. For v \u2208 L^*, (v, L) \u2282 Z. So (v, x) \u2208 Z for all x \u2208 L. Then (v, v) can be fractional. \n\nThe discriminant form q: L^*/L \u2192 Q/2Z is given by q(v + L) = (v, v) mod 2Z. For the discriminant group of order 2, the generator of L^*/L is an element of order 2, say g. Then q(g) must be an element of Q/2Z. Since the discriminant group is cyclic of order 2, then the generator g satisfies 2g = 0. Then q(g) must be a value in Q/2Z such that when multiplied by 2 (the order), it becomes 0 mod 2Z. That is, 2q(g) \u2261 0 mod 2Z, so q(g) \u2261 0 or 1 mod Z. Therefore, q(g) can be 0 mod 2Z or 1 mod 2Z. But since q takes values in Q/2Z, the possible values for q(g) are 0 or 1 mod 2Z. However, since the lattice is even, the discriminant form must be even. Wait, what does it mean for the discriminant form to be even? Maybe that q(v) is in Z mod 2Z for all v. If q(g) is 0 or 1 mod 2Z, then if the discriminant form is even, then q(g) must be 0 mod 2Z. But wait, if the discriminant form is even, then q(v) \u2208 Z mod 2Z for all v. So if q(g) \u2261 0 mod 1 (i.e., integer), then mod 2Z, it can be 0 or 1. Wait, no. If q(g) is an integer, then mod 2Z, it would be 0 or 1. But in the case of even lattices, I think the discriminant form must have q(v) \u2208 Z mod 2Z, but maybe with some parity condition.\n\nAlternatively, according to Nikulin's theorem on discriminant forms, the discriminant form must be a non-degenerate quadratic form on the discriminant group. For the discriminant group Z/2Z, there are two possible quadratic forms. One is q(1) = 0 mod 2Z, the other is q(1) = 1 mod 2Z. But for an even lattice, the discriminant form must satisfy q(v) \u2261 (v,v) mod 2Z, and since the lattice is even, (v,v) for v in the original lattice is even. But when extended to the dual lattice, the values can be different.\n\nWait, but in our case, the discriminant group is cyclic of order 2. So the possible discriminant forms are either the trivial one where q(g) = 0 mod 2Z, or the non-trivial one where q(g) = 1 mod 2Z. However, the evenness condition might restrict which forms are allowed. \n\nIf the lattice is even, then for any x in L, (x,x) is even. For the discriminant form q: L^*/L \u2192 Q/2Z, if we have v \u2208 L^*, then q(v + L) = (v, v) mod 2Z. Now, since L is even, what does that imply about q? If we take v \u2208 L^*, then (v, v) can be rational. But for the discriminant form to be compatible with the even lattice, perhaps certain conditions must hold. For example, if 2v \u2208 L, then (2v, 2v) = 4(v, v) must be even, so 4(v,v) \u2208 2Z \u21d2 (v,v) \u2208 (1/2)Z. Therefore, (v,v) must be a half-integer. Wait, so if 2v is in L, then (v,v) is in (1/2)Z. Then, the discriminant form q(v + L) = (v,v) mod 2Z. If (v,v) = k/2 for some integer k, then k/2 mod 2Z. So k can be even or odd. If k is even, then k/2 is an integer, which mod 2Z is 0. If k is odd, then k/2 is a half-integer, so mod 2Z, it's 1/2 mod 2Z. Wait, but Q/2Z allows fractions. So maybe in this case, the discriminant form could take 0 or 1/2 mod 2Z. But I need to check. \n\nAlternatively, Nikulin's classification might state that for an even lattice, the discriminant form must be a quadratic form such that q(x) \u2261 (x,x) mod 2Z. But since the original lattice is even, then (x,x) is even for x \u2208 L. For v \u2208 L^*, 2v \u2208 L, so (2v, 2v) is even \u21d2 4(v,v) is even \u21d2 (v,v) \u2208 (1/2)Z. So (v,v) is either integer or half-integer. If (v,v) is an integer, then q(v + L) = 0 mod 2Z. If it's half-integer, then q(v + L) = 1/2 mod 2Z. But since the discriminant group is of order 2, the generator g must satisfy q(g) in {0, 1} mod 2Z? Wait, no. If the discriminant group is Z/2Z, then the possible values of q(g) are in Q/2Z. So for instance, q(g) could be 0 mod 2Z or 1 mod 2Z. But considering (v,v) can be a half-integer, then (v,v) = k + 1/2, so mod 2Z, it's (k + 1/2) mod 2Z. But 1/2 mod 2Z is equivalent to 1 mod 2Z when multiplied by 2. Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me look for references. \n\nAlternatively, the genus of an even lattice is determined by its signature, determinant, and discriminant form. In our case, the lattice is positive definite, so the signature is (17,0). The determinant is 2, and the discriminant form is a quadratic form on the discriminant group Z/2Z. If there's only one possible quadratic form on Z/2Z that is compatible with the even lattice condition, then the genus would have only one class. If there are two possible forms, then maybe two genera, each possibly containing one lattice. \n\nWait, but the discriminant form for an even lattice must satisfy certain conditions. In particular, for each prime p, the p-component of the discriminant form must be a non-degenerate quadratic form on the p-component of the discriminant group. Here, the discriminant group is Z/2Z, so only the 2-component matters. For a quadratic form on Z/2Z, there are two possibilities: either q(1) = 0 mod 2Z or q(1) = 1 mod 2Z. However, for an even lattice, the quadratic form must satisfy q(x) \u2261 (x,x) mod 2Z. If our lattice is even, then for x in the original lattice, (x,x) is even. But for the dual lattice, when projected to the discriminant group, what does this imply? \n\nSuppose we have a generator g of the discriminant group Z/2Z. Then, 2g = 0. So, for the quadratic form, q(g) must be such that 2q(g) \u2261 0 mod 2Z. That is, 2q(g) is an integer. So q(g) can be 0 mod 2Z or 1 mod 2Z. Wait, 2q(g) mod 2Z is 0 in either case. If q(g) is 0 mod 2Z, then 2q(g) is 0 mod 2Z. If q(g) is 1 mod 2Z, then 2q(g) is 2 mod 2Z, which is also 0. So both possibilities are allowed. Therefore, there are two possible discriminant forms for the discriminant group Z/2Z. But does the evenness condition of the lattice restrict this? \n\nIf the lattice is even, then the discriminant form must be even in the sense that q(x) \u2208 Z mod 2Z for all x. Wait, but if q(g) is 1 mod 2Z, then q(g) = 1 mod 2Z, which is equivalent to 1/2 mod 1, which is not an integer. Wait, no. Wait, the discriminant form is a function from L^*/L to Q/2Z. So q(g) is in Q/2Z. If the original lattice is even, then for x \u2208 L, (x,x) is even. For the discriminant form, it's required that q(v + L) \u2261 (v,v) mod 2Z. So if we pick a representative v of the coset g, then (v,v) mod 2Z must equal q(g). Therefore, (v,v) must be equal to q(g) mod 2Z. But since v is in L^*, which is dual to L, (v, x) \u2208 Z for all x \u2208 L. In particular, 2v \u2208 L, so (2v, 2v) is even. Therefore, 4(v, v) is even \u21d2 (v, v) \u2208 (1/2)Z. So (v, v) is either integer or half-integer. \n\nIf (v, v) is an integer, then q(g) = (v,v) mod 2Z, which is either 0 or 1 mod 2Z. But (v, v) being integer and even would give 0 mod 2Z. If (v, v) is integer and odd, it's 1 mod 2Z. However, since L is even, if 2v is in L, then (2v, 2v) must be even. So if (v, v) is k, then (2v, 2v) = 4k must be even \u21d2 k is in (1/2)Z. So if 4k is even, then 4k is even regardless of whether k is integer or half-integer. Wait, 4k is even if k is integer (4*1=4 even) or half-integer (4*(1/2)=2 even). So that doesn't restrict k. So (v, v) can be integer or half-integer. Therefore, when we take q(g) = (v, v) mod 2Z, if (v, v) is an integer, then mod 2Z it's 0 or 1. If (v, v) is a half-integer (like 1/2), then mod 2Z, that's equivalent to 1/2. Wait, but 1/2 mod 2Z isn't 0 or 1. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait, Q/2Z means rational numbers modulo 2Z. So 1/2 mod 2Z is equivalent to 1/2, because 1/2 + 2Z is just the coset {1/2 + 2k | k \u2208 Z}. Similarly, 3/2 would be equivalent to 1/2 mod 2Z. So if (v, v) is 1/2, then q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. But 1/2 mod 2Z is not in Z mod 2Z. Therefore, if the discriminant form is supposed to take values in Z mod 2Z (i.e., integers modulo 2), then this would not be allowed. However, the discriminant form for even lattices is allowed to take values in Q/2Z. Wait, no. Wait, according to standard references, the discriminant form of an even lattice is a quadratic form q: L^*/L \u2192 Q/2Z such that q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y) \u2261 (x, y) mod 2Z. So it's allowed to have values in Q/2Z, not necessarily Z/2Z. Therefore, even lattices can have discriminant forms with values like 1/2 mod 2Z. \n\nBut how does this affect the possible quadratic forms on Z/2Z? Let's see. Let the discriminant group be cyclic of order 2. Let g generate it. Then, the quadratic form q is determined by q(g). The bilinear form associated with q is b(x, y) = q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y) mod 2Z. For x = y = g, this gives b(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) mod 2Z. But 2g = 0, so q(0) = 0 mod 2Z (since the quadratic form takes 0 to 0). Therefore, b(g, g) = 0 - 2q(g) mod 2Z. But the bilinear form must also be compatible with the original lattice's bilinear form. \n\nAlternatively, since the discriminant group is of order 2, the bilinear form b must satisfy b(g, g) \u2261 2q(g) mod 2Z. But since the discriminant group has exponent 2, the bilinear form b is a symmetric bilinear form on Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z \u2192 Q/Z. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. The bilinear form associated with the quadratic form q is b(x, y) = (q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y)) mod 1. But since the discriminant group is Z/2Z, then for x, y in Z/2Z, the possible values of b(x, y) would be in Q/Z. For x = y = g, we get b(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) mod 1. But 2g = 0, so q(2g) = q(0) = 0, so b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. However, the bilinear form must satisfy b(g, g) \u2261 2q(g) mod 1? Wait, maybe I'm mixing mod 1 and mod 2Z. Let's clarify.\n\nThe discriminant form q: L^*/L \u2192 Q/2Z. Then the associated bilinear form b: L^*/L \u00d7 L^*/L \u2192 Q/Z is given by b(x, y) = (q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y)) mod 1. Wait, no. Because Q/2Z divided by Z would not directly make sense. Alternatively, since the quadratic form q is defined modulo 2Z, then the bilinear form would be (x, y) mod Z. Wait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me check a reference.\n\nAccording to Nikulin's paper, the discriminant form of an even lattice is a quadratic form q: A \u2192 Q/2Z, where A is the discriminant group, and it satisfies q(ka) = k\u00b2 q(a) for k \u2208 Z, and the associated bilinear form b: A \u00d7 A \u2192 Q/Z is given by b(a, a') = (q(a + a') - q(a) - q(a')) mod 1. \n\nIn our case, A = Z/2Z. Let\u2019s denote the generator as g. Then, any element in A is either 0 or g. The quadratic form q must satisfy q(0) = 0 mod 2Z. For q(g), it can be any element of Q/2Z such that the bilinear form is well-defined. Let\u2019s compute b(g, g). \n\nb(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) mod 1. But 2g = 0 in A, so q(2g) = q(0) = 0 mod 2Z. Therefore, b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. However, since the bilinear form must take values in Q/Z, and we have that (g, g) must correspond to an element of Q/Z. Moreover, for the bilinear form to be compatible with the original lattice's bilinear form, which is integer-valued on L \u00d7 L. But since the original lattice is even, the bilinear form (x, y) is integer-valued, and even for the diagonal terms. \n\nBut given that the discriminant form must satisfy certain non-degeneracy conditions. In particular, the bilinear form b must be non-degenerate. For A = Z/2Z, the bilinear form b is determined by b(g, g). But since A has order 2, the only possible non-degenerate bilinear form would require b(g, g) \u2260 0 mod 1. But let's compute b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. \n\nSuppose q(g) = a/2 mod 2Z, where a is an integer. Then, -2q(g) mod 1 is -2*(a/2) mod 1 = -a mod 1. Since a is an integer, this is 0 mod 1. Wait, so regardless of q(g), b(g, g) is 0 mod 1. That would imply that the bilinear form is degenerate, which contradicts the non-degeneracy required for the discriminant form. \n\nHmm, that can't be right. There must be a mistake here. Let me re-examine. If A is Z/2Z, then the bilinear form b must be non-degenerate. But for a cyclic group of order 2, a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form must satisfy b(g, g) \u2260 0 mod 1. However, as above, we have b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. Let's take q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. Then, -2*(1/2) = -1 \u2261 0 mod 1. That's still 0. If q(g) = 0 mod 2Z, then b(g, g) = 0 mod 1. So regardless of q(g), b(g, g) is 0 mod 1. Therefore, the bilinear form is degenerate. \n\nThis suggests that there's no non-degenerate bilinear form on Z/2Z, which would imply that there's no even lattice with determinant 2 in dimension 17. But that can't be right, because determinant 2 is possible. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the discriminant form must be non-degenerate. If the bilinear form is zero, then the form is degenerate. But if b(g, g) = 0 mod 1, then the form is degenerate. Therefore, there's no non-degenerate bilinear form on Z/2Z? That can't be true. For example, on Z/2Z, define b(g, g) = 1/2 mod 1. Then this would be a non-degenerate form, since b(g, g) generates the entire group Q/Z. Wait, 1/2 mod 1 is non-zero. But earlier, we saw that for our case, b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. So if we want b(g, g) = 1/2 mod 1, then -2q(g) \u2261 1/2 mod 1 \u21d2 q(g) \u2261 -1/4 mod (1/2)Z. But q(g) is defined modulo 2Z. \n\nWait, maybe I need to reconcile these equations. Suppose we set q(g) = 1/4 mod 2Z. Then, -2*(1/4) = -1/2 \u2261 1/2 mod 1. Then the bilinear form would be 1/2 mod 1, which is non-degenerate. However, q(g) = 1/4 mod 2Z is allowed? Because Q/2Z includes fractions. So 1/4 mod 2Z is equivalent to 1/4 + 2k for integers k, but in Q/2Z, this would be 1/4, 9/4, etc., but all equivalent modulo 2Z. However, 1/4 is not an element of Z/2Z, but Q/2Z allows fractions. \n\nBut for an even lattice, the quadratic form must satisfy q(x) \u2261 (x,x) mod 2Z. If we have a generator g such that q(g) = 1/4 mod 2Z, then (v, v) = 1/4 mod 2Z for some v in the dual lattice. However, (v, v) must be in Q, and since the lattice is even, 2v is in L, so (2v, 2v) is even. Let's compute that: (2v, 2v) = 4(v, v). If (v, v) = 1/4 + 2k for some integer k, then 4(v, v) = 1 + 8k, which is 1 mod 8. But (2v, 2v) must be even, but 1 + 8k is odd. Contradiction. Therefore, such a q(g) = 1/4 mod 2Z is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that q(g) = 0 mod 2Z or 1/2 mod 2Z. Let\u2019s check those. If q(g) = 0 mod 2Z, then b(g, g) = 0 mod 1. So the bilinear form is degenerate. If q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z, then b(g, g) = -2*(1/2) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 \u2261 0 mod 1. Again, the bilinear form is degenerate. Therefore, there's no way to have a non-degenerate bilinear form on Z/2Z, implying that no such even lattice exists? But the question is asking how many exist, so maybe the answer is zero? But that doesn't make sense because determinant 2 should be possible. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the discriminant group is cyclic. If the determinant is 2, the discriminant group could be isomorphic to Z/2Z, but maybe it's a non-cyclic group? No, since 2 is prime, any group of order 2 is cyclic. So the discriminant group must be cyclic. \n\nTherefore, if the discriminant group is cyclic of order 2 and there's no non-degenerate bilinear form on it, then there are no even lattices with determinant 2 in any dimension. But that's not true, because for example, in dimension 1, a lattice of determinant 2 would be generated by a vector of squared length 2, which is even. But dimension 1 is possible. Wait, but dimension 1 even lattices exist. For example, the lattice generated by a vector with norm 2. So in dimension 1, determinant 2 is possible, and it's even. \n\nBut according to our previous reasoning, in dimension 1, the discriminant group would be Z/2Z. But then, we would face the same problem: the discriminant form must have a non-degenerate bilinear form, which would require the bilinear form to be non-degenerate on Z/2Z. But according to our previous calculation, this is impossible. However, in reality, such a lattice exists. Therefore, there's a flaw in the reasoning. \n\nWait, maybe in the case of odd dimensions, the discriminant form can be different. Or maybe the condition for the discriminant form being non-degenerate is different. Wait, no. The discriminant form must always be non-degenerate. So why does the one-dimensional lattice with determinant 2 exist? Let me check. \n\nIn dimension 1, let L be generated by a vector e with (e, e) = 2. Then, the dual lattice L^* is generated by e^*/2, where e^*(e) = 1. So L^*/L is generated by e^*/2 + L, which has order 2. The discriminant group is Z/2Z. The quadratic form q on the generator g = e^*/2 + L is q(g) = (e^*/2, e^*/2) mod 2Z. Compute that: (e^*/2, e^*/2) = (1/2)^2 * (e, e) = 1/4 * 2 = 1/2. So q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. Then the bilinear form b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1 = -2*(1/2) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 = 0 mod 1. So the bilinear form is zero, which is degenerate. But this contradicts the requirement that the discriminant form must be non-degenerate. \n\nBut the one-dimensional lattice with determinant 2 does exist, so there must be a mistake in the reasoning. Therefore, perhaps the requirement is different. Maybe for odd dimensions, the discriminant form can have a different property. Alternatively, maybe the discriminant form in odd dimensions can have a different type of quadratic form. \n\nWait, no, the non-degeneracy is a general requirement regardless of dimension. So there's a paradox here: the one-dimensional even lattice of determinant 2 exists, but according to the discriminant form analysis, it should have a degenerate bilinear form, which is impossible. Therefore, my analysis must be incorrect. \n\nLet me re-examine the discriminant form for the one-dimensional lattice. Let L be generated by e with (e, e) = 2. The dual lattice L^* is generated by e/2, since (e/2, e) = 1. Therefore, L^*/L is of order 2, generated by e/2 + L. The quadratic form q(g) = (e/2, e/2) mod 2Z. Compute that: (e/2, e/2) = (1/4)(e, e) = (1/4)*2 = 1/2. So q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. The associated bilinear form is b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1 = -2*(1/2) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 = 0 mod 1. So the bilinear form is zero. But this contradicts non-degeneracy. \n\nBut this lattice does exist. Therefore, either there's a mistake in the theory or in my understanding. Alternatively, maybe in odd dimensions, the discriminant form doesn't need to be non-degenerate? No, I think the discriminant form is always non-degenerate for even lattices. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that there are no such lattices in dimension 17, but there are in dimension 1. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the issue is with the genus. For the one-dimensional lattice, the genus is determined by the local conditions at all primes. But in higher dimensions, the local conditions might not be satisfiable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in odd dimensions, even lattices with determinant 2 do not exist, but in even dimensions they do. But even in dimension 1, which is odd, the lattice exists. So this must not be the case. Therefore, there must be a mistake in assuming that the discriminant form must be non-degenerate. But according to standard theory, the discriminant form is always non-degenerate. \n\nWait, let me check a reference. According to Nikulin's paper, \"Integral symmetric bilinear forms and some of their applications\", the discriminant form is always non-degenerate. Therefore, in the one-dimensional case, even though our calculation suggests the bilinear form is zero, there must be an error. \n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the formula for the bilinear form. Let me recall that the bilinear form is defined as b(x, y) = q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y) mod 1. In the one-dimensional case, the bilinear form on the discriminant group would be b(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) mod 1. But 2g = 0, so q(0) = 0 mod 2Z. Therefore, b(g, g) = 0 - 2*(1/2) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 = 0 mod 1. So indeed, the bilinear form is zero. But according to Nikulin, the discriminant form is non-degenerate. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in this whole approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the discriminant form isn't required to be non-degenerate in odd dimensions. But no, the non-degeneracy is part of the definition regardless of dimension. \n\nThis suggests that there is an inconsistency, but since the one-dimensional even lattice with determinant 2 exists, and yet the discriminant form analysis suggests it should not. Therefore, my understanding of the discriminant form calculation must be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the discriminant form in this case is considered non-degenerate in a different way. For example, if the bilinear form is non-zero, but in our case, it's zero. But it's not non-degenerate. So how come the lattice exists? This is a contradiction. \n\nPerhaps the error lies in the assumption that the discriminant group is cyclic. In the one-dimensional case, L^*/L is indeed cyclic of order 2. But if the bilinear form is zero, then the discriminant form is degenerate. Therefore, according to Nikulin, such a lattice should not exist. But it does. Therefore, my understanding must be flawed. \n\nWait, maybe in odd dimensions, the signature plays a role. The signature formula for the discriminant form: For an even lattice, the signature \u03c3 must satisfy \u03c3 \u2261 \u03c4 mod 8, where \u03c4 is the type of the discriminant form. Wait, the exact formula is given by \u03c3 \u2261 \u03c4 mod 8, where \u03c4 is the signature of the discriminant form. But this might not apply directly here. \n\nAlternatively, the existence of such a lattice might require that certain conditions on the discriminant form and the dimension and signature be satisfied. For example, in the case of the one-dimensional lattice, the dimension is 1 and the signature is 1. Perhaps there's a compatibility condition that allows the discriminant form to be degenerate in some cases. \n\nBut according to standard theory, the discriminant form is non-degenerate. So either my calculation is wrong or the theory has exceptions. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the confusion, maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the number of such lattices is zero because of some parity condition. For example, the determinant of an even lattice in odd dimensions must be congruent to something. But I don't recall such a condition. Alternatively, the number might be 1 or 2. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the mass formula. The Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula gives the sum over the genus of 1/|Aut(L)|. If we can compute this mass for the genus of even lattices with determinant 2 in dimension 17, and if the mass is less than 1, then there must be no such lattices. But computing this mass is very complicated, especially in higher dimensions. \n\nAlternatively, for determinant 2 in odd dimensions, maybe such lattices cannot exist. Because for even lattices in odd dimensions, there might be some restrictions. For example, in even dimensions, the determinant of an even unimodular lattice must be 1 and the signature divisible by 8. But in odd dimensions, even unimodular lattices don't exist. For determinant 2, maybe similar restrictions apply. \n\nLet me think about the existence conditions. Suppose we have an even lattice of odd dimension n and determinant d. Are there any congruence conditions on d? For example, in even dimensions, the determinant of an even unimodular lattice must be 1, and the signature divisible by 8. For non-unimodular even lattices, maybe there are other conditions. \n\nAlternatively, suppose we take an odd lattice and scale it. Wait, but the question is about even lattices. Let's see. For a lattice to be even, all norms are even. If in odd dimension, can such a lattice have determinant 2? \n\nFor example, in dimension 1, yes, as shown. In dimension 3, 5, etc. But maybe in higher dimensions, certain conditions must be met. \n\nAnother angle: The determinant of a lattice is the product of the squares of the lengths of the basis vectors divided by the square of the volume. Wait, no. The determinant is the square of the volume of the fundamental parallelotope. So determinant 2 implies the volume is sqrt(2). \n\nBut how does this relate to the structure of the lattice? Perhaps by taking orthogonal direct sums of smaller lattices. For example, a lattice in dimension 17 could be an orthogonal direct sum of a 1-dimensional lattice of determinant 2 and 16 copies of the 1-dimensional lattice of determinant 1 (which is odd). But since we need the entire lattice to be even, this approach wouldn't work because the odd lattices would introduce vectors with odd norms. \n\nAlternatively, construct the lattice as a direct sum of even lattices. For example, the E8 lattice is even and has determinant 1. If we take E8 \u2295 E8 \u2295 ... and add a suitable 1-dimensional lattice. But wait, E8 is 8-dimensional, so two copies give 16 dimensions. Adding a 1-dimensional even lattice (like the one generated by a vector of norm 2) would give dimension 17. The determinant would be (1)^2 * 2 = 2. So this would be an even lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2. Therefore, such lattices do exist. \n\nTherefore, the answer cannot be zero. So my previous reasoning about the discriminant form must be incorrect. \n\nGiven that example, this lattice would have a decomposition E8^2 \u2295 <2>, where <2> is the 1-dimensional lattice of determinant 2. The discriminant group of this lattice would be the product of the discriminant groups of each component. The E8 lattice has determinant 1, so their discriminant groups are trivial. The <2> lattice has discriminant group Z/2Z. Therefore, the total discriminant group is Z/2Z. The discriminant form is inherited from the <2> component, which as before, would be q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. But then the bilinear form would be b(g, g) = -1 mod 1 = 0, which seems degenerate. But this contradicts the existence of the lattice. \n\nBut since the lattice exists, maybe the discriminant form in this case is allowed to be degenerate? Or maybe the mistake is in the calculation of the bilinear form. Let me compute it again. \n\nFor the lattice L = E8^2 \u2295 <2>, the discriminant group is Z/2Z. Let g be the generator. Then, the quadratic form q(g) should be 1/2 mod 2Z, as before. The associated bilinear form b(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) = q(0) - 2*(1/2) = 0 - 1 \u2261 -1 mod 1. Which is 0 mod 1. So the bilinear form is zero. But this is degenerate, which contradicts the requirement. Therefore, this suggests that the lattice L cannot exist, but in reality, it does. \n\nThis indicates a serious flaw in my understanding. Perhaps the discriminant form for the orthogonal sum of lattices is not simply the product of the discriminant forms, but there's more to it. Wait, no. The discriminant group of an orthogonal direct sum is the direct sum of the discriminant groups. However, in our case, E8 has trivial discriminant group, and <2> has Z/2Z. So the total discriminant group is Z/2Z. The quadratic form is the sum of the quadratic forms on each component. Since the E8 components contribute zero, the total quadratic form is the same as that of <2>, which is 1/2 mod 2Z. Therefore, the same problem arises. \n\nThis suggests that such a lattice cannot exist, but clearly, we can construct it. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the theory as I'm applying it. Perhaps the conditions are different when the lattice is decomposable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bilinear form being degenerate is allowed in some cases. But according to standard references, the discriminant bilinear form is always non-degenerate. Therefore, this is a contradiction. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the answer is that there is exactly one such lattice. If we can construct one example, like E8^2 \u2295 <2>, and if the genus of such lattices is singleton, then the answer is 1. However, if there are multiple genera or multiple classes in the genus, the answer could be higher. \n\nAlternatively, since the discriminant group is Z/2Z and there's only one possible quadratic form (which might be forced by the dimension and the evenness), then there is only one genus, and by the mass formula, if the mass is 1, then there is only one lattice. But I don't know the mass formula for this case. \n\nAlternatively, in the book \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" by Conway and Sloane, certain enumeration results are given. For example, in even dimensions, the number of even unimodular lattices is known, but in odd dimensions, they don't exist. For determinant 2, maybe there's a similar uniqueness. For example, the lattice constructed as E8^2 \u2295 <2> is the only one. However, there might be others by choosing different gluings of the components. \n\nAlternatively, the number might be 2, corresponding to the two possible quadratic forms on the discriminant group Z/2Z. But earlier analysis suggested that one of them leads to a degenerate bilinear form. But if only one quadratic form is possible (the one with q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z), then there is only one lattice. However, the existence of the degenerate case might mean that no lattice can exist with that discriminant form, leaving only one possibility. \n\nBut given that we can construct a lattice, perhaps there's only one genus, and by classification theorems, the number is 1. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the conflicting thoughts, I'll hazard that there is exactly one such lattice, so the answer is 1, with a confidence of around 60% because I'm not entirely sure about the discriminant form analysis.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The problem involves determining the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 with determinant 2.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive definite even lattices exist in dimension 17 with determinant 2. Hmm, where do I start? Let me recall some concepts. \n\nFirst, a lattice is a free abelian group equipped with a positive definite symmetric bilinear form. An even lattice means that the norm of every vector (x,x) is an even integer. The determinant of the lattice is the determinant of its Gram matrix, which is the square of the volume of the fundamental domain. \n\nNow, for even lattices, especially in higher dimensions, the classification can be related to root systems or modular forms. But wait, dimension 17 is kind of a tricky number. I remember that in even dimensions, the theory of unimodular lattices (determinant 1) is more developed, like the E8 lattice in 8 dimensions. But here the determinant is 2, not 1, and the dimension is 17, which is odd. That complicates things.\n\nFor even lattices, the determinant must be congruent modulo certain numbers. Let me think. Since the lattice is even, the determinant should be congruent to \u00b11 modulo some value depending on the dimension? Or maybe it's related to the signature? Wait, for even unimodular lattices, the signature has to be divisible by 8. But this isn't unimodular since determinant is 2. So that condition doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the discriminant form. The determinant relates to the discriminant group's order, which is the determinant. The discriminant form is a quadratic form on the discriminant group. For an even lattice, the discriminant form has certain properties. In particular, if the lattice is even, then the discriminant form is even in some sense. \n\nBut how does this help count the number of lattices? Maybe the genus of a lattice is determined by its signature, determinant, and discriminant form. Then, if two lattices are in the same genus, they can be compared using the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula, which gives the mass (a weighted count) of lattices in the genus. If the mass is computable and happens to be 1, then there's only one lattice in that genus. \n\nWait, the question is about positive definite lattices. So we need to consider the genus of positive definite even lattices with determinant 2 in dimension 17. If the genus consists of only one isomorphism class, then the answer would be 1. But how can I check that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a theorem that states that in certain conditions, the genus contains only one class. For instance, in lower dimensions, sometimes there's uniqueness. But in higher dimensions, like 17, maybe there's more. Or perhaps determinant 2 is small enough that only a few lattices exist.\n\nAnother angle: determinant 2 implies that the discriminant group has order 2. The discriminant group is isomorphic to the dual lattice modulo the original lattice, so its order is the determinant. So the discriminant group here would be of order 2, hence isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 2 or a direct sum of smaller cyclic groups, but since 2 is prime, it's cyclic. Therefore, the discriminant group is cyclic of order 2. \n\nFor an even lattice, the discriminant form must satisfy certain conditions. The quadratic form q on the discriminant group Z/2Z takes values in Q/2Z. Since the lattice is even, for any element x in the dual lattice, (x,x) must be an integer. Wait, for an even lattice, the norms are even integers. So for x in the lattice, (x,x) is even. For x in the dual lattice, (x,x) can be a half-integer or integer? Hmm, not sure. \n\nBut the discriminant form q is defined by q(v + L) = (v,v) mod 2Z, where v is in the dual lattice. Since the original lattice is even, then for any v in the dual lattice, 2v is in the original lattice, so (2v, 2v) is an even integer. Therefore, (v,v) must be in (1/4)Z? Not sure. Let's think: If L is even, then (x,x) \u2208 2Z for x \u2208 L. For v \u2208 L^*, (v, L) \u2282 Z. So (v, x) \u2208 Z for all x \u2208 L. Then (v, v) can be fractional. \n\nThe discriminant form q: L^*/L \u2192 Q/2Z is given by q(v + L) = (v, v) mod 2Z. For the discriminant group of order 2, the generator of L^*/L is an element of order 2, say g. Then q(g) must be an element of Q/2Z. Since the discriminant group is cyclic of order 2, then the generator g satisfies 2g = 0. Then q(g) must be a value in Q/2Z such that when multiplied by 2 (the order), it becomes 0 mod 2Z. That is, 2q(g) \u2261 0 mod 2Z, so q(g) \u2261 0 or 1 mod Z. Therefore, q(g) can be 0 mod 2Z or 1 mod 2Z. But since q takes values in Q/2Z, the possible values for q(g) are 0 or 1 mod 2Z. However, since the lattice is even, the discriminant form must be even. Wait, what does it mean for the discriminant form to be even? Maybe that q(v) is in Z mod 2Z for all v. If q(g) is 0 or 1 mod 2Z, then if the discriminant form is even, then q(g) must be 0 mod 2Z. But wait, if the discriminant form is even, then q(v) \u2208 Z mod 2Z for all v. So if q(g) \u2261 0 mod 1 (i.e., integer), then mod 2Z, it can be 0 or 1. Wait, no. If q(g) is an integer, then mod 2Z, it would be 0 or 1. But in the case of even lattices, I think the discriminant form must have q(v) \u2208 Z mod 2Z, but maybe with some parity condition.\n\nAlternatively, according to Nikulin's theorem on discriminant forms, the discriminant form must be a non-degenerate quadratic form on the discriminant group. For the discriminant group Z/2Z, there are two possible quadratic forms. One is q(1) = 0 mod 2Z, the other is q(1) = 1 mod 2Z. But for an even lattice, the discriminant form must satisfy q(v) \u2261 (v,v) mod 2Z, and since the lattice is even, (v,v) for v in the original lattice is even. But when extended to the dual lattice, the values can be different.\n\nWait, but in our case, the discriminant group is cyclic of order 2. So the possible discriminant forms are either the trivial one where q(g) = 0 mod 2Z, or the non-trivial one where q(g) = 1 mod 2Z. However, the evenness condition might restrict which forms are allowed. \n\nIf the lattice is even, then for any x in L, (x,x) is even. For the discriminant form q: L^*/L \u2192 Q/2Z, if we have v \u2208 L^*, then q(v + L) = (v, v) mod 2Z. Now, since L is even, what does that imply about q? If we take v \u2208 L^*, then (v, v) can be rational. But for the discriminant form to be compatible with the even lattice, perhaps certain conditions must hold. For example, if 2v \u2208 L, then (2v, 2v) = 4(v, v) must be even, so 4(v,v) \u2208 2Z \u21d2 (v,v) \u2208 (1/2)Z. Therefore, (v,v) must be a half-integer. Wait, so if 2v is in L, then (v,v) is in (1/2)Z. Then, the discriminant form q(v + L) = (v,v) mod 2Z. If (v,v) = k/2 for some integer k, then k/2 mod 2Z. So k can be even or odd. If k is even, then k/2 is an integer, which mod 2Z is 0. If k is odd, then k/2 is a half-integer, so mod 2Z, it's 1/2 mod 2Z. Wait, but Q/2Z allows fractions. So maybe in this case, the discriminant form could take 0 or 1/2 mod 2Z. But I need to check. \n\nAlternatively, Nikulin's classification might state that for an even lattice, the discriminant form must be a quadratic form such that q(x) \u2261 (x,x) mod 2Z. But since the original lattice is even, then (x,x) is even for x \u2208 L. For v \u2208 L^*, 2v \u2208 L, so (2v, 2v) is even \u21d2 4(v,v) is even \u21d2 (v,v) \u2208 (1/2)Z. So (v,v) is either integer or half-integer. If (v,v) is an integer, then q(v + L) = 0 mod 2Z. If it's half-integer, then q(v + L) = 1/2 mod 2Z. But since the discriminant group is of order 2, the generator g must satisfy q(g) in {0, 1} mod 2Z? Wait, no. If the discriminant group is Z/2Z, then the possible values of q(g) are in Q/2Z. So for instance, q(g) could be 0 mod 2Z or 1 mod 2Z. But considering (v,v) can be a half-integer, then (v,v) = k + 1/2, so mod 2Z, it's (k + 1/2) mod 2Z. But 1/2 mod 2Z is equivalent to 1 mod 2Z when multiplied by 2. Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me look for references. \n\nAlternatively, the genus of an even lattice is determined by its signature, determinant, and discriminant form. In our case, the lattice is positive definite, so the signature is (17,0). The determinant is 2, and the discriminant form is a quadratic form on the discriminant group Z/2Z. If there's only one possible quadratic form on Z/2Z that is compatible with the even lattice condition, then the genus would have only one class. If there are two possible forms, then maybe two genera, each possibly containing one lattice. \n\nWait, but the discriminant form for an even lattice must satisfy certain conditions. In particular, for each prime p, the p-component of the discriminant form must be a non-degenerate quadratic form on the p-component of the discriminant group. Here, the discriminant group is Z/2Z, so only the 2-component matters. For a quadratic form on Z/2Z, there are two possibilities: either q(1) = 0 mod 2Z or q(1) = 1 mod 2Z. However, for an even lattice, the quadratic form must satisfy q(x) \u2261 (x,x) mod 2Z. If our lattice is even, then for x in the original lattice, (x,x) is even. But for the dual lattice, when projected to the discriminant group, what does this imply? \n\nSuppose we have a generator g of the discriminant group Z/2Z. Then, 2g = 0. So, for the quadratic form, q(g) must be such that 2q(g) \u2261 0 mod 2Z. That is, 2q(g) is an integer. So q(g) can be 0 mod 2Z or 1 mod 2Z. Wait, 2q(g) mod 2Z is 0 in either case. If q(g) is 0 mod 2Z, then 2q(g) is 0 mod 2Z. If q(g) is 1 mod 2Z, then 2q(g) is 2 mod 2Z, which is also 0. So both possibilities are allowed. Therefore, there are two possible discriminant forms for the discriminant group Z/2Z. But does the evenness condition of the lattice restrict this? \n\nIf the lattice is even, then the discriminant form must be even in the sense that q(x) \u2208 Z mod 2Z for all x. Wait, but if q(g) is 1 mod 2Z, then q(g) = 1 mod 2Z, which is equivalent to 1/2 mod 1, which is not an integer. Wait, no. Wait, the discriminant form is a function from L^*/L to Q/2Z. So q(g) is in Q/2Z. If the original lattice is even, then for x \u2208 L, (x,x) is even. For the discriminant form, it's required that q(v + L) \u2261 (v,v) mod 2Z. So if we pick a representative v of the coset g, then (v,v) mod 2Z must equal q(g). Therefore, (v,v) must be equal to q(g) mod 2Z. But since v is in L^*, which is dual to L, (v, x) \u2208 Z for all x \u2208 L. In particular, 2v \u2208 L, so (2v, 2v) is even. Therefore, 4(v, v) is even \u21d2 (v, v) \u2208 (1/2)Z. So (v, v) is either integer or half-integer. \n\nIf (v, v) is an integer, then q(g) = (v,v) mod 2Z, which is either 0 or 1 mod 2Z. But (v, v) being integer and even would give 0 mod 2Z. If (v, v) is integer and odd, it's 1 mod 2Z. However, since L is even, if 2v is in L, then (2v, 2v) must be even. So if (v, v) is k, then (2v, 2v) = 4k must be even \u21d2 k is in (1/2)Z. So if 4k is even, then 4k is even regardless of whether k is integer or half-integer. Wait, 4k is even if k is integer (4*1=4 even) or half-integer (4*(1/2)=2 even). So that doesn't restrict k. So (v, v) can be integer or half-integer. Therefore, when we take q(g) = (v, v) mod 2Z, if (v, v) is an integer, then mod 2Z it's 0 or 1. If (v, v) is a half-integer (like 1/2), then mod 2Z, that's equivalent to 1/2. Wait, but 1/2 mod 2Z isn't 0 or 1. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait, Q/2Z means rational numbers modulo 2Z. So 1/2 mod 2Z is equivalent to 1/2, because 1/2 + 2Z is just the coset {1/2 + 2k | k \u2208 Z}. Similarly, 3/2 would be equivalent to 1/2 mod 2Z. So if (v, v) is 1/2, then q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. But 1/2 mod 2Z is not in Z mod 2Z. Therefore, if the discriminant form is supposed to take values in Z mod 2Z (i.e., integers modulo 2), then this would not be allowed. However, the discriminant form for even lattices is allowed to take values in Q/2Z. Wait, no. Wait, according to standard references, the discriminant form of an even lattice is a quadratic form q: L^*/L \u2192 Q/2Z such that q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y) \u2261 (x, y) mod 2Z. So it's allowed to have values in Q/2Z, not necessarily Z/2Z. Therefore, even lattices can have discriminant forms with values like 1/2 mod 2Z. \n\nBut how does this affect the possible quadratic forms on Z/2Z? Let's see. Let the discriminant group be cyclic of order 2. Let g generate it. Then, the quadratic form q is determined by q(g). The bilinear form associated with q is b(x, y) = q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y) mod 2Z. For x = y = g, this gives b(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) mod 2Z. But 2g = 0, so q(0) = 0 mod 2Z (since the quadratic form takes 0 to 0). Therefore, b(g, g) = 0 - 2q(g) mod 2Z. But the bilinear form must also be compatible with the original lattice's bilinear form. \n\nAlternatively, since the discriminant group is of order 2, the bilinear form b must satisfy b(g, g) \u2261 2q(g) mod 2Z. But since the discriminant group has exponent 2, the bilinear form b is a symmetric bilinear form on Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z \u2192 Q/Z. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. The bilinear form associated with the quadratic form q is b(x, y) = (q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y)) mod 1. But since the discriminant group is Z/2Z, then for x, y in Z/2Z, the possible values of b(x, y) would be in Q/Z. For x = y = g, we get b(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) mod 1. But 2g = 0, so q(2g) = q(0) = 0, so b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. However, the bilinear form must satisfy b(g, g) \u2261 2q(g) mod 1? Wait, maybe I'm mixing mod 1 and mod 2Z. Let's clarify.\n\nThe discriminant form q: L^*/L \u2192 Q/2Z. Then the associated bilinear form b: L^*/L \u00d7 L^*/L \u2192 Q/Z is given by b(x, y) = (q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y)) mod 1. Wait, no. Because Q/2Z divided by Z would not directly make sense. Alternatively, since the quadratic form q is defined modulo 2Z, then the bilinear form would be (x, y) mod Z. Wait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me check a reference.\n\nAccording to Nikulin's paper, the discriminant form of an even lattice is a quadratic form q: A \u2192 Q/2Z, where A is the discriminant group, and it satisfies q(ka) = k\u00b2 q(a) for k \u2208 Z, and the associated bilinear form b: A \u00d7 A \u2192 Q/Z is given by b(a, a') = (q(a + a') - q(a) - q(a')) mod 1. \n\nIn our case, A = Z/2Z. Let\u2019s denote the generator as g. Then, any element in A is either 0 or g. The quadratic form q must satisfy q(0) = 0 mod 2Z. For q(g), it can be any element of Q/2Z such that the bilinear form is well-defined. Let\u2019s compute b(g, g). \n\nb(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) mod 1. But 2g = 0 in A, so q(2g) = q(0) = 0 mod 2Z. Therefore, b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. However, since the bilinear form must take values in Q/Z, and we have that (g, g) must correspond to an element of Q/Z. Moreover, for the bilinear form to be compatible with the original lattice's bilinear form, which is integer-valued on L \u00d7 L. But since the original lattice is even, the bilinear form (x, y) is integer-valued, and even for the diagonal terms. \n\nBut given that the discriminant form must satisfy certain non-degeneracy conditions. In particular, the bilinear form b must be non-degenerate. For A = Z/2Z, the bilinear form b is determined by b(g, g). But since A has order 2, the only possible non-degenerate bilinear form would require b(g, g) \u2260 0 mod 1. But let's compute b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. \n\nSuppose q(g) = a/2 mod 2Z, where a is an integer. Then, -2q(g) mod 1 is -2*(a/2) mod 1 = -a mod 1. Since a is an integer, this is 0 mod 1. Wait, so regardless of q(g), b(g, g) is 0 mod 1. That would imply that the bilinear form is degenerate, which contradicts the non-degeneracy required for the discriminant form. \n\nHmm, that can't be right. There must be a mistake here. Let me re-examine. If A is Z/2Z, then the bilinear form b must be non-degenerate. But for a cyclic group of order 2, a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form must satisfy b(g, g) \u2260 0 mod 1. However, as above, we have b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. Let's take q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. Then, -2*(1/2) = -1 \u2261 0 mod 1. That's still 0. If q(g) = 0 mod 2Z, then b(g, g) = 0 mod 1. So regardless of q(g), b(g, g) is 0 mod 1. Therefore, the bilinear form is degenerate. \n\nThis suggests that there's no non-degenerate bilinear form on Z/2Z, which would imply that there's no even lattice with determinant 2 in dimension 17. But that can't be right, because determinant 2 is possible. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the discriminant form must be non-degenerate. If the bilinear form is zero, then the form is degenerate. But if b(g, g) = 0 mod 1, then the form is degenerate. Therefore, there's no non-degenerate bilinear form on Z/2Z? That can't be true. For example, on Z/2Z, define b(g, g) = 1/2 mod 1. Then this would be a non-degenerate form, since b(g, g) generates the entire group Q/Z. Wait, 1/2 mod 1 is non-zero. But earlier, we saw that for our case, b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1. So if we want b(g, g) = 1/2 mod 1, then -2q(g) \u2261 1/2 mod 1 \u21d2 q(g) \u2261 -1/4 mod (1/2)Z. But q(g) is defined modulo 2Z. \n\nWait, maybe I need to reconcile these equations. Suppose we set q(g) = 1/4 mod 2Z. Then, -2*(1/4) = -1/2 \u2261 1/2 mod 1. Then the bilinear form would be 1/2 mod 1, which is non-degenerate. However, q(g) = 1/4 mod 2Z is allowed? Because Q/2Z includes fractions. So 1/4 mod 2Z is equivalent to 1/4 + 2k for integers k, but in Q/2Z, this would be 1/4, 9/4, etc., but all equivalent modulo 2Z. However, 1/4 is not an element of Z/2Z, but Q/2Z allows fractions. \n\nBut for an even lattice, the quadratic form must satisfy q(x) \u2261 (x,x) mod 2Z. If we have a generator g such that q(g) = 1/4 mod 2Z, then (v, v) = 1/4 mod 2Z for some v in the dual lattice. However, (v, v) must be in Q, and since the lattice is even, 2v is in L, so (2v, 2v) is even. Let's compute that: (2v, 2v) = 4(v, v). If (v, v) = 1/4 + 2k for some integer k, then 4(v, v) = 1 + 8k, which is 1 mod 8. But (2v, 2v) must be even, but 1 + 8k is odd. Contradiction. Therefore, such a q(g) = 1/4 mod 2Z is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that q(g) = 0 mod 2Z or 1/2 mod 2Z. Let\u2019s check those. If q(g) = 0 mod 2Z, then b(g, g) = 0 mod 1. So the bilinear form is degenerate. If q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z, then b(g, g) = -2*(1/2) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 \u2261 0 mod 1. Again, the bilinear form is degenerate. Therefore, there's no way to have a non-degenerate bilinear form on Z/2Z, implying that no such even lattice exists? But the question is asking how many exist, so maybe the answer is zero? But that doesn't make sense because determinant 2 should be possible. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the discriminant group is cyclic. If the determinant is 2, the discriminant group could be isomorphic to Z/2Z, but maybe it's a non-cyclic group? No, since 2 is prime, any group of order 2 is cyclic. So the discriminant group must be cyclic. \n\nTherefore, if the discriminant group is cyclic of order 2 and there's no non-degenerate bilinear form on it, then there are no even lattices with determinant 2 in any dimension. But that's not true, because for example, in dimension 1, a lattice of determinant 2 would be generated by a vector of squared length 2, which is even. But dimension 1 is possible. Wait, but dimension 1 even lattices exist. For example, the lattice generated by a vector with norm 2. So in dimension 1, determinant 2 is possible, and it's even. \n\nBut according to our previous reasoning, in dimension 1, the discriminant group would be Z/2Z. But then, we would face the same problem: the discriminant form must have a non-degenerate bilinear form, which would require the bilinear form to be non-degenerate on Z/2Z. But according to our previous calculation, this is impossible. However, in reality, such a lattice exists. Therefore, there's a flaw in the reasoning. \n\nWait, maybe in the case of odd dimensions, the discriminant form can be different. Or maybe the condition for the discriminant form being non-degenerate is different. Wait, no. The discriminant form must always be non-degenerate. So why does the one-dimensional lattice with determinant 2 exist? Let me check. \n\nIn dimension 1, let L be generated by a vector e with (e, e) = 2. Then, the dual lattice L^* is generated by e^*/2, where e^*(e) = 1. So L^*/L is generated by e^*/2 + L, which has order 2. The discriminant group is Z/2Z. The quadratic form q on the generator g = e^*/2 + L is q(g) = (e^*/2, e^*/2) mod 2Z. Compute that: (e^*/2, e^*/2) = (1/2)^2 * (e, e) = 1/4 * 2 = 1/2. So q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. Then the bilinear form b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1 = -2*(1/2) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 = 0 mod 1. So the bilinear form is zero, which is degenerate. But this contradicts the requirement that the discriminant form must be non-degenerate. \n\nBut the one-dimensional lattice with determinant 2 does exist, so there must be a mistake in the reasoning. Therefore, perhaps the requirement is different. Maybe for odd dimensions, the discriminant form can have a different property. Alternatively, maybe the discriminant form in odd dimensions can have a different type of quadratic form. \n\nWait, no, the non-degeneracy is a general requirement regardless of dimension. So there's a paradox here: the one-dimensional even lattice of determinant 2 exists, but according to the discriminant form analysis, it should have a degenerate bilinear form, which is impossible. Therefore, my analysis must be incorrect. \n\nLet me re-examine the discriminant form for the one-dimensional lattice. Let L be generated by e with (e, e) = 2. The dual lattice L^* is generated by e/2, since (e/2, e) = 1. Therefore, L^*/L is of order 2, generated by e/2 + L. The quadratic form q(g) = (e/2, e/2) mod 2Z. Compute that: (e/2, e/2) = (1/4)(e, e) = (1/4)*2 = 1/2. So q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. The associated bilinear form is b(g, g) = -2q(g) mod 1 = -2*(1/2) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 = 0 mod 1. So the bilinear form is zero. But this contradicts non-degeneracy. \n\nBut this lattice does exist. Therefore, either there's a mistake in the theory or in my understanding. Alternatively, maybe in odd dimensions, the discriminant form doesn't need to be non-degenerate? No, I think the discriminant form is always non-degenerate for even lattices. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that there are no such lattices in dimension 17, but there are in dimension 1. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the issue is with the genus. For the one-dimensional lattice, the genus is determined by the local conditions at all primes. But in higher dimensions, the local conditions might not be satisfiable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in odd dimensions, even lattices with determinant 2 do not exist, but in even dimensions they do. But even in dimension 1, which is odd, the lattice exists. So this must not be the case. Therefore, there must be a mistake in assuming that the discriminant form must be non-degenerate. But according to standard theory, the discriminant form is always non-degenerate. \n\nWait, let me check a reference. According to Nikulin's paper, \"Integral symmetric bilinear forms and some of their applications\", the discriminant form is always non-degenerate. Therefore, in the one-dimensional case, even though our calculation suggests the bilinear form is zero, there must be an error. \n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the formula for the bilinear form. Let me recall that the bilinear form is defined as b(x, y) = q(x + y) - q(x) - q(y) mod 1. In the one-dimensional case, the bilinear form on the discriminant group would be b(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) mod 1. But 2g = 0, so q(0) = 0 mod 2Z. Therefore, b(g, g) = 0 - 2*(1/2) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 = 0 mod 1. So indeed, the bilinear form is zero. But according to Nikulin, the discriminant form is non-degenerate. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in this whole approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the discriminant form isn't required to be non-degenerate in odd dimensions. But no, the non-degeneracy is part of the definition regardless of dimension. \n\nThis suggests that there is an inconsistency, but since the one-dimensional even lattice with determinant 2 exists, and yet the discriminant form analysis suggests it should not. Therefore, my understanding of the discriminant form calculation must be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the discriminant form in this case is considered non-degenerate in a different way. For example, if the bilinear form is non-zero, but in our case, it's zero. But it's not non-degenerate. So how come the lattice exists? This is a contradiction. \n\nPerhaps the error lies in the assumption that the discriminant group is cyclic. In the one-dimensional case, L^*/L is indeed cyclic of order 2. But if the bilinear form is zero, then the discriminant form is degenerate. Therefore, according to Nikulin, such a lattice should not exist. But it does. Therefore, my understanding must be flawed. \n\nWait, maybe in odd dimensions, the signature plays a role. The signature formula for the discriminant form: For an even lattice, the signature \u03c3 must satisfy \u03c3 \u2261 \u03c4 mod 8, where \u03c4 is the type of the discriminant form. Wait, the exact formula is given by \u03c3 \u2261 \u03c4 mod 8, where \u03c4 is the signature of the discriminant form. But this might not apply directly here. \n\nAlternatively, the existence of such a lattice might require that certain conditions on the discriminant form and the dimension and signature be satisfied. For example, in the case of the one-dimensional lattice, the dimension is 1 and the signature is 1. Perhaps there's a compatibility condition that allows the discriminant form to be degenerate in some cases. \n\nBut according to standard theory, the discriminant form is non-degenerate. So either my calculation is wrong or the theory has exceptions. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the confusion, maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the number of such lattices is zero because of some parity condition. For example, the determinant of an even lattice in odd dimensions must be congruent to something. But I don't recall such a condition. Alternatively, the number might be 1 or 2. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the mass formula. The Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula gives the sum over the genus of 1/|Aut(L)|. If we can compute this mass for the genus of even lattices with determinant 2 in dimension 17, and if the mass is less than 1, then there must be no such lattices. But computing this mass is very complicated, especially in higher dimensions. \n\nAlternatively, for determinant 2 in odd dimensions, maybe such lattices cannot exist. Because for even lattices in odd dimensions, there might be some restrictions. For example, in even dimensions, the determinant of an even unimodular lattice must be 1 and the signature divisible by 8. But in odd dimensions, even unimodular lattices don't exist. For determinant 2, maybe similar restrictions apply. \n\nLet me think about the existence conditions. Suppose we have an even lattice of odd dimension n and determinant d. Are there any congruence conditions on d? For example, in even dimensions, the determinant of an even unimodular lattice must be 1, and the signature divisible by 8. For non-unimodular even lattices, maybe there are other conditions. \n\nAlternatively, suppose we take an odd lattice and scale it. Wait, but the question is about even lattices. Let's see. For a lattice to be even, all norms are even. If in odd dimension, can such a lattice have determinant 2? \n\nFor example, in dimension 1, yes, as shown. In dimension 3, 5, etc. But maybe in higher dimensions, certain conditions must be met. \n\nAnother angle: The determinant of a lattice is the product of the squares of the lengths of the basis vectors divided by the square of the volume. Wait, no. The determinant is the square of the volume of the fundamental parallelotope. So determinant 2 implies the volume is sqrt(2). \n\nBut how does this relate to the structure of the lattice? Perhaps by taking orthogonal direct sums of smaller lattices. For example, a lattice in dimension 17 could be an orthogonal direct sum of a 1-dimensional lattice of determinant 2 and 16 copies of the 1-dimensional lattice of determinant 1 (which is odd). But since we need the entire lattice to be even, this approach wouldn't work because the odd lattices would introduce vectors with odd norms. \n\nAlternatively, construct the lattice as a direct sum of even lattices. For example, the E8 lattice is even and has determinant 1. If we take E8 \u2295 E8 \u2295 ... and add a suitable 1-dimensional lattice. But wait, E8 is 8-dimensional, so two copies give 16 dimensions. Adding a 1-dimensional even lattice (like the one generated by a vector of norm 2) would give dimension 17. The determinant would be (1)^2 * 2 = 2. So this would be an even lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2. Therefore, such lattices do exist. \n\nTherefore, the answer cannot be zero. So my previous reasoning about the discriminant form must be incorrect. \n\nGiven that example, this lattice would have a decomposition E8^2 \u2295 <2>, where <2> is the 1-dimensional lattice of determinant 2. The discriminant group of this lattice would be the product of the discriminant groups of each component. The E8 lattice has determinant 1, so their discriminant groups are trivial. The <2> lattice has discriminant group Z/2Z. Therefore, the total discriminant group is Z/2Z. The discriminant form is inherited from the <2> component, which as before, would be q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z. But then the bilinear form would be b(g, g) = -1 mod 1 = 0, which seems degenerate. But this contradicts the existence of the lattice. \n\nBut since the lattice exists, maybe the discriminant form in this case is allowed to be degenerate? Or maybe the mistake is in the calculation of the bilinear form. Let me compute it again. \n\nFor the lattice L = E8^2 \u2295 <2>, the discriminant group is Z/2Z. Let g be the generator. Then, the quadratic form q(g) should be 1/2 mod 2Z, as before. The associated bilinear form b(g, g) = q(2g) - 2q(g) = q(0) - 2*(1/2) = 0 - 1 \u2261 -1 mod 1. Which is 0 mod 1. So the bilinear form is zero. But this is degenerate, which contradicts the requirement. Therefore, this suggests that the lattice L cannot exist, but in reality, it does. \n\nThis indicates a serious flaw in my understanding. Perhaps the discriminant form for the orthogonal sum of lattices is not simply the product of the discriminant forms, but there's more to it. Wait, no. The discriminant group of an orthogonal direct sum is the direct sum of the discriminant groups. However, in our case, E8 has trivial discriminant group, and <2> has Z/2Z. So the total discriminant group is Z/2Z. The quadratic form is the sum of the quadratic forms on each component. Since the E8 components contribute zero, the total quadratic form is the same as that of <2>, which is 1/2 mod 2Z. Therefore, the same problem arises. \n\nThis suggests that such a lattice cannot exist, but clearly, we can construct it. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the theory as I'm applying it. Perhaps the conditions are different when the lattice is decomposable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bilinear form being degenerate is allowed in some cases. But according to standard references, the discriminant bilinear form is always non-degenerate. Therefore, this is a contradiction. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the answer is that there is exactly one such lattice. If we can construct one example, like E8^2 \u2295 <2>, and if the genus of such lattices is singleton, then the answer is 1. However, if there are multiple genera or multiple classes in the genus, the answer could be higher. \n\nAlternatively, since the discriminant group is Z/2Z and there's only one possible quadratic form (which might be forced by the dimension and the evenness), then there is only one genus, and by the mass formula, if the mass is 1, then there is only one lattice. But I don't know the mass formula for this case. \n\nAlternatively, in the book \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" by Conway and Sloane, certain enumeration results are given. For example, in even dimensions, the number of even unimodular lattices is known, but in odd dimensions, they don't exist. For determinant 2, maybe there's a similar uniqueness. For example, the lattice constructed as E8^2 \u2295 <2> is the only one. However, there might be others by choosing different gluings of the components. \n\nAlternatively, the number might be 2, corresponding to the two possible quadratic forms on the discriminant group Z/2Z. But earlier analysis suggested that one of them leads to a degenerate bilinear form. But if only one quadratic form is possible (the one with q(g) = 1/2 mod 2Z), then there is only one lattice. However, the existence of the degenerate case might mean that no lattice can exist with that discriminant form, leaving only one possibility. \n\nBut given that we can construct a lattice, perhaps there's only one genus, and by classification theorems, the number is 1. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the conflicting thoughts, I'll hazard that there is exactly one such lattice, so the answer is 1, with a confidence of around 60% because I'm not entirely sure about the discriminant form analysis.",
