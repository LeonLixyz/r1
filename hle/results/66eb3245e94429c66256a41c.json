  "question": "Let G = (V , E) be a monopolar graph on n vertices and m edges. Provide the O complexity of the number of maximal cliques of G.",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the maximal cliques in a monopolar graph. Hmm, first, I need to remember what a monopolar graph is. I think monopolar graphs are a type of graph that can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. So, the vertices can be split into two subsets: one where every pair is connected (a clique) and another where no edges exist between them (independent set). \n\nNow, the question is about the O complexity of the number of maximal cliques in such a graph. Maximal cliques are cliques that can't be made larger by adding any other vertex. So, in a graph structure like a monopolar graph, we need to figure out how many such cliques there can be.\n\nLet me break down the structure. Suppose the monopolar graph G is partitioned into a clique C and an independent set I. Any maximal clique in G must be a subset of the clique C, possibly including some vertices from I that are connected to all vertices in that subset. But wait, since I is an independent set, vertices in I can't be connected to each other. So, when considering a maximal clique, if we include a vertex from I, it must be connected to every vertex in the clique part it's added to. But since I is independent, adding more than one vertex from I into the clique isn't possible because they aren't connected. Therefore, any maximal clique can consist of some subset of C plus at most one vertex from I, provided that vertex is connected to all members of the subset.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because if a vertex in I is connected to all vertices in a subset S of C, then S plus that vertex forms a clique. But since S is part of the original clique C, maybe even C itself. But if the entire C is connected to a vertex in I, then C plus that vertex would form a larger clique. But wait, C is already a clique. If there's a vertex in I connected to all of C, then C union {v} would be a larger clique. But since I is an independent set, v can't connect to any other vertex in I, but it's connected to all in C. So, in that case, the maximal cliques would include the original C (if no vertices in I are connected to all of C) and any C' subset of C combined with a vertex from I connected to all of C'. But how does this affect the total number?\n\nWait, maybe let's think step by step. Let C be the clique and I the independent set. All edges within C are present. Any edges between C and I can exist, but no edges within I. \n\nA maximal clique can be either:\n\n1. A subset of C, possibly the entire C, that is maximal. But wait, since C itself is a clique, any subset of C that isn't part of a larger clique in C would be a maximal clique. But actually, no. If C is a clique, then the only maximal clique in C is C itself. But maybe not. Wait, suppose C has vertices {a, b, c}. Then the only maximal clique in C is {a, b, c}, since all are connected. So subsets like {a, b} are cliques but not maximal because you can add c. So the only maximal clique in C is C itself. But if a vertex in I is connected to all of C, then C plus that vertex would form a larger clique. But wait, since I is independent, that vertex can't connect to others in I. So if there's a vertex v in I connected to all of C, then C union {v} is a clique. Therefore, that would be a maximal clique, and then C itself would not be maximal if such a v exists. \n\nBut if there are multiple vertices in I that are connected to all of C, then each such vertex can form a larger clique with C. But since each of those vertices in I are not connected to each other (because I is independent), the cliques would be C union {v} for each such v. But C itself would only be a maximal clique if there are no vertices in I connected to all of C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some vertices in I are connected to subsets of C. For instance, a vertex v in I is connected to a subset S of C, but not all. Then, S union {v} could be a clique. But for that to be a maximal clique, there must be no other vertex in C \\ S that is connected to all of S and v. Hmm, this seems complicated. \n\nWait, but in a graph partitioned into a clique C and an independent set I, the maximal cliques could be:\n\n- The entire clique C, unless there exists a vertex in I connected to all of C. If such a vertex exists, then C is not maximal because adding the vertex would create a larger clique. \n\n- For each vertex v in I, if v is connected to a subset S of C such that S union {v} is a maximal clique. However, since C is a clique, any subset S of C would be a clique. But if there's a vertex v in I connected to all of S but not to some other vertices in C, then S union {v} could be a maximal clique. However, in that case, adding any other vertex from C that is connected to all of S and to v would create a larger clique.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the structure more carefully. Let's suppose that for each vertex v in I, the neighbors of v in C form a subset N(v). Then, the cliques involving v would be the cliques formed by subsets of N(v) union {v}. But since N(v) is a subset of C (which is a clique), any subset of N(v) is a clique. Adding v (which is connected to all in N(v)) makes it a clique. However, to be a maximal clique, there can't be a larger clique containing it. \n\nFor example, suppose v is connected to a subset S of C. Then S union {v} is a clique. But if there's a vertex u in C not in S that is connected to all of S and to v, then S union {v, u} would be a larger clique. Therefore, S union {v} can only be maximal if there's no u in C \\ S that is connected to all S and to v. But since C is a clique, any u in C \\ S is connected to all of S. Because in C, all vertices are connected. So if v is connected to some subset S of C, then any u in C \\ S is adjacent to all of S (since C is a clique) but not adjacent to v (since u is not in S). Wait, no. If u is in C \\ S, then u is in C, hence connected to all others in C, but whether u is connected to v depends on whether v is adjacent to u. But S was the neighbors of v in C. So if u is in C \\ S, then v is not adjacent to u. Therefore, in that case, u is not adjacent to v. So then, the clique S union {v} would not be extendable by u, because u is not adjacent to v. Therefore, S union {v} is a maximal clique if there is no vertex in C \\ S adjacent to v. But wait, since S is the set of neighbors of v in C, then C \\ S is exactly the vertices in C not adjacent to v. Therefore, in that case, S is the maximal subset of C adjacent to v. Then, S union {v} is a clique, and since no vertex in C \\ S is adjacent to v, they cannot be added. But any vertex in C \\ S is adjacent to all of S (since C is a clique), but not to v. So if we take S union {v} as a clique, and then take any vertex u in C \\ S, then adding u to S union {v} would not form a clique because u is not adjacent to v. Therefore, S union {v} is indeed a maximal clique. \n\nAdditionally, the entire clique C itself is a maximal clique only if there's no vertex in I adjacent to all of C. If there exists a vertex in I adjacent to all of C, then C union {v} is a larger clique, so C is not maximal. \n\nSo putting this together, the maximal cliques in G are:\n\n1. The clique C union any vertex in I that is adjacent to all of C. Each such vertex forms a maximal clique of size |C| +1. However, if there are multiple vertices in I adjacent to all of C, each combination of C and one such vertex is a maximal clique. But wait, since those vertices in I are not adjacent to each other (they form an independent set), adding more than one from I to C would not form a clique. So for each vertex v in I adjacent to all of C, we have a maximal clique C union {v}. Also, if there are such vertices, then the original C is not a maximal clique. \n\n2. For each vertex v in I that is adjacent to a subset S of C (but not all of C), then S union {v} is a maximal clique, provided that S is a maximal subset in C that can be paired with v. Wait, no. Because S is exactly the neighbors of v in C, so S is the set of vertices in C adjacent to v. Therefore, S could be any subset of C. For each v in I, the set S_v = N(v) (neighbors of v in C) union {v} is a clique. But whether it's maximal depends on whether there's a larger clique containing S_v. Since S_v is a clique, and any superset would have to include more vertices from C or another vertex from I. \n\nBut since C is a clique, if there exists a vertex u in C not in S_v (i.e., u is not adjacent to v), then S_v union {u} is not a clique because u is not adjacent to v. Therefore, S_v union {v} is a maximal clique. Wait, S_v is N(v) union {v}, and adding any other vertex from C \\ N(v) would not be adjacent to v, hence can't form a larger clique. Therefore, each such S_v union {v} is a maximal clique.\n\nAdditionally, if there are no vertices in I adjacent to all of C, then C itself is a maximal clique. Otherwise, C is not, because C union any such v is a larger clique.\n\nSo the total number of maximal cliques would be:\n\n- If there are k vertices in I adjacent to all of C, then k maximal cliques of size |C| +1. \n\n- For each vertex v in I not adjacent to all of C (i.e., adjacent to a proper subset S_v of C), we have a maximal clique S_v union {v}. \n\n- Plus, if there are no vertices in I adjacent to all of C, then C itself is a maximal clique.\n\nBut how does this sum up in terms of O complexity?\n\nLet\u2019s denote |C| = c and |I| = i, with c + i = n.\n\nFor vertices in I that are adjacent to all of C: Each such vertex contributes a maximal clique of size c+1. The number of such cliques is equal to the number of vertices in I adjacent to all of C. Let's call this number k. So k \u2264 i.\n\nFor the other vertices in I (i - k of them), each contributes a maximal clique S_v \u222a {v}, where S_v is a subset of C. The number of such cliques is (i - k), each corresponding to a different v. However, the size of S_v could vary. But regardless of the size, each of these contributes one maximal clique. \n\nAdditionally, if k = 0 (no vertices in I are adjacent to all of C), then C itself is a maximal clique. So in that case, total maximal cliques would be (i - k) + 1 (if k=0). Otherwise, if k >0, then C is not a maximal clique. \n\nSo total maximal cliques would be k + (i - k) + [1 if k=0] = i + [1 if k=0]. But since k can be 0 or more, the maximum possible number of maximal cliques would be when k=0, leading to i +1. Otherwise, if k>0, the total is i. Wait, no. Let's re-express:\n\nTotal = (number of vertices in I adjacent to all of C) + (number of vertices in I not adjacent to all of C) + (1 if there are no vertices in I adjacent to all of C).\n\nWhich is equal to k + (i -k) + (1 if k=0) = i + (1 if k=0). So maximum possible is i +1, minimum i. But i is the size of the independent set. Since i can be up to n -1 (if the clique C has 1 vertex), then the number of maximal cliques is O(i + 1). But since i is part of n (the total number of vertices), this would be O(n).\n\nWait, but perhaps this analysis is missing something. Because each vertex in I that is not adjacent to all of C contributes exactly one maximal clique (S_v \u222a {v}), and those adjacent to all of C each contribute one. The only question is whether the original C is a maximal clique. If any vertex in I is adjacent to all of C, then C is not maximal. Otherwise, C is. So total cliques are:\n\nIf k >0: k (from vertices adjacent to all C) + (i -k) (from others) \u2192 which sums to i.\n\nIf k=0: 1 (C) + (i) (each vertex in I contributes S_v \u222a {v}) \u2192 i +1.\n\nBut in either case, the total number of maximal cliques is O(i +1). But since i can be up to n-1 (if the clique C has size 1), then the maximum number is O(n). Therefore, the number of maximal cliques is linear in the number of vertices. So the O complexity is O(n).\n\nWait, but let me check if this is correct. For example, suppose the clique C has size c, and the independent set I has size i. Each vertex in I can contribute at most one maximal clique. Plus possibly the clique C itself if no vertices in I are adjacent to all of C. Therefore, the total number of maximal cliques is at most i +1. Since i can be up to n-1 (when c=1), the maximum number is n. So O(n).\n\nBut I need to confirm if this is correct. Let's take an example. Suppose C has 3 vertices, and I has 2 vertices. Suppose one vertex in I is connected to all of C. Then the maximal cliques would be C \u222a {v1} (if v1 is connected to all C), and for the other vertex v2 in I connected to some subset S of C, then S \u222a {v2} is a maximal clique. Wait, but if v2 is connected to two vertices in C, say, then the maximal clique would be those two plus v2. However, in this case, C itself is not a maximal clique because v1 is connected to all of C. So total cliques here would be 1 (from v1) plus 1 (from v2) \u2192 total 2. Which is equal to i=2. So in this case, it's i.\n\nAnother example: if no vertices in I are connected to all of C. Say, I has two vertices, each connected to a different subset of C. Then we have two maximal cliques from I's vertices, plus the clique C itself. So total cliques are 3, which is i +1 = 2 +1 =3. So O(i+1), which is O(n) since i \u2264n.\n\nTherefore, in the worst case, the number of maximal cliques in a monopolar graph is linear in the number of vertices. Hence, the O complexity is O(n).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where a vertex in I is connected to multiple subsets of C, leading to more maximal cliques. But no, each vertex in I can only contribute one maximal clique (its neighborhood in C plus itself). Even if a vertex in I is connected to multiple different subsets, it's only the maximal one. Wait, no, because the neighborhood in C is fixed for each vertex in I. For a given v in I, N(v) is a subset of C, and the maximal clique is N(v) \u222a {v}, which is unique for each v. So each v in I contributes at most one maximal clique. \n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal cliques is O(n). Hence, the answer should be O(n), and the complexity is linear.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: In a monopolar graph partitioned into a clique \\( C \\) and an independent set \\( I \\), maximal cliques arise from two sources: (1) cliques formed by \\( C \\cup \\{v\\} \\) for vertices \\( v \\in I \\) adjacent to all of \\( C \\), and (2) cliques formed by \\( S \\cup \\{v\\} \\) where \\( S \\subseteq C \\) is the neighborhood of \\( v \\in I \\).

I think monopolar graphs are a type of graph that can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set.

Maximal cliques are cliques that can't be made larger by adding any other vertex. So, in a graph structure like a monopolar graph, we need to figure out how many such cliques there can be.\n\nLet me break down the structure. Suppose the monopolar graph G is partitioned into a clique C and an independent set I. Any maximal clique in G must be a subset of the clique C, possibly including some vertices from I that are connected to all vertices in that subset. But wait, since I is an independent set, vertices in I can't be connected to each other. So, when considering a maximal clique, if we include a vertex from I, it must be connected to every vertex in the clique part it's added to. But since I is independent, adding more than one vertex from I into the clique isn't possible because they aren't connected. Therefore, any maximal clique can consist of some subset of C plus at most one vertex from I, provided that vertex is connected to all members of the subset.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because if a vertex in I is connected to all vertices in a subset S of C, then S plus that vertex forms a clique. But since S is part of the original clique C, maybe even C itself. But if the entire C is connected to a vertex in I, then C plus that vertex would form a larger clique. But wait, C is already a clique. If there's a vertex in I connected to all of C, then C union {v} would be a larger clique. But since I is an independent set, v can't connect to any other vertex in I, but it's connected to all in C. So, in that case, the maximal cliques would include the original C (if no vertices in I are connected to all of C) and any C' subset of C combined with a vertex from I connected to all of C'. But how does this affect the total number?\n\nWait, maybe let's think step by step. Let C be the clique and I the independent set. All edges within C are present. Any edges between C and I can exist, but no edges within I. \n\nA maximal clique can be either:\n\n1. A subset of C, possibly the entire C, that is maximal. But wait, since C itself is a clique, any subset of C that isn't part of a larger clique in C would be a maximal clique. But actually, no. If C is a clique, then the only maximal clique in C is C itself. But maybe not. Wait, suppose C has vertices {a, b, c}. Then the only maximal clique in C is {a, b, c}, since all are connected. So subsets like {a, b} are cliques but not maximal because you can add c. So the only maximal clique in C is C itself. But if a vertex in I is connected to all of C, then C plus that vertex would form a larger clique. But wait, since I is independent, that vertex can't connect to others in I. So if there's a vertex v in I connected to all of C, then C union {v} is a clique. Therefore, that would be a maximal clique, and then C itself would not be maximal if such a v exists. \n\nBut if there are multiple vertices in I that are connected to all of C, then each such vertex can form a larger clique with C. But since each of those vertices in I are not connected to each other (because I is independent), the cliques would be C union {v} for each such v. But C itself would only be a maximal clique if there are no vertices in I connected to all of C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe some vertices in I are connected to subsets of C. For instance, a vertex v in I is connected to a subset S of C, but not all. Then, S union {v} could be a clique. But for that to be a maximal clique, there must be no other vertex in C \\ S that is connected to all of S and v. Hmm, this seems complicated. \n\nWait, but in a graph partitioned into a clique C and an independent set I, the maximal cliques could be:\n\n- The entire clique C, unless there exists a vertex in I connected to all of C. If such a vertex exists, then C is not maximal because adding the vertex would create a larger clique. \n\n- For each vertex v in I, if v is connected to a subset S of C such that S union {v} is a maximal clique.

However, in that case, adding any other vertex from C that is connected to all of S and to v would create a larger clique.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the structure more carefully. Let's suppose that for each vertex v in I, the neighbors of v in C form a subset N(v). Then, the cliques involving v would be the cliques formed by subsets of N(v) union {v}. But since N(v) is a subset of C (which is a clique), any subset of N(v) is a clique. Adding v (which is connected to all in N(v)) makes it a clique. However, to be a maximal clique, there can't be a larger clique containing it. \n\nFor example, suppose v is connected to a subset S of C. Then S union {v} is a clique. But if there's a vertex u in C not in S that is connected to all of S and to v, then S union {v, u} would be a larger clique. Therefore, S union {v} can only be maximal if there's no u in C \\ S that is connected to all S and to v. But since C is a clique, any u in C \\ S is connected to all of S. Because in C, all vertices are connected. So if v is connected to some subset S of C, then any u in C \\ S is adjacent to all of S (since C is a clique) but not adjacent to v (since u is not in S). Wait, no. If u is in C \\ S, then u is in C, hence connected to all others in C, but whether u is connected to v depends on whether v is adjacent to u. But S was the neighbors of v in C. So if u is in C \\ S, then v is not adjacent to u. Therefore, in that case, u is not adjacent to v. So then, the clique S union {v} would not be extendable by u, because u is not adjacent to v. Therefore, S union {v} is a maximal clique if there is no vertex in C \\ S adjacent to v. But wait, since S is the set of neighbors of v in C, then C \\ S is exactly the vertices in C not adjacent to v. Therefore, in that case, S is the maximal subset of C adjacent to v.

Therefore, S union {v} is indeed a maximal clique. \n\nAdditionally, the entire clique C itself is a maximal clique only if there's no vertex in I adjacent to all of C. If there exists a vertex in I adjacent to all of C, then C union {v} is a larger clique, so C is not maximal. \n\nSo putting this together, the maximal cliques in G are:\n\n1. The clique C union any vertex in I that is adjacent to all of C. Each such vertex forms a maximal clique of size |C| +1. However, if there are multiple vertices in I adjacent to all of C, each combination of C and one such vertex is a maximal clique.

Because S is exactly the neighbors of v in C, so S is the set of vertices in C adjacent to v. Therefore, S could be any subset of C. For each v in I, the set S_v = N(v) (neighbors of v in C) union {v} is a clique. But whether it's maximal depends on whether there's a larger clique containing S_v.

But regardless of the size, each of these contributes one maximal clique. \n\nAdditionally, if k = 0 (no vertices in I are adjacent to all of C), then C itself is a maximal clique. So in that case, total maximal cliques would be (i - k) + 1 (if k=0). Otherwise, if k >0, then C is not a maximal clique. \n\nSo total maximal cliques would be k + (i - k) + [1 if k=0] = i + [1 if k=0]. But since k can be 0 or more, the maximum possible number of maximal cliques would be when k=0, leading to i +1. Otherwise, if k>0, the total is i. Wait, no. Let's re-express:\n\nTotal = (number of vertices in I adjacent to all of C) + (number of vertices in I not adjacent to all of C) + (1 if there are no vertices in I adjacent to all of C).\n\nWhich is equal to k + (i -k) + (1 if k=0) = i + (1 if k=0). So maximum possible is i +1, minimum i. But i is the size of the independent set. Since i can be up to n -1 (if the clique C has 1 vertex), then the number of maximal cliques is O(i + 1). But since i is part of n (the total number of vertices), this would be O(n).\n\nWait, but perhaps this analysis is missing something.

But since i can be up to n-1 (if the clique C has size 1), then the maximum number is O(n). Therefore, the number of maximal cliques is linear in the number of vertices. So the O complexity is O(n).\n\nWait, but let me check if this is correct. For example, suppose the clique C has size c, and the independent set I has size i. Each vertex in I can contribute at most one maximal clique. Plus possibly the clique C itself if no vertices in I are adjacent to all of C. Therefore, the total number of maximal cliques is at most i +1. Since i can be up to n-1 (when c=1), the maximum number is n. So O(n).\n\nBut I need to confirm if this is correct. Let's take an example. Suppose C has 3 vertices, and I has 2 vertices. Suppose one vertex in I is connected to all of C. Then the maximal cliques would be C \u222a {v1} (if v1 is connected to all C), and for the other vertex v2 in I connected to some subset S of C, then S \u222a {v2} is a maximal clique. Wait, but if v2 is connected to two vertices in C, say, then the maximal clique would be those two plus v2. However, in this case, C itself is not a maximal clique because v1 is connected to all of C. So total cliques here would be 1 (from v1) plus 1 (from v2) \u2192 total 2. Which is equal to i=2. So in this case, it's i.\n\nAnother example: if no vertices in I are connected to all of C. Say, I has two vertices, each connected to a different subset of C. Then we have two maximal cliques from I's vertices, plus the clique C itself. So total cliques are 3, which is i +1 = 2 +1 =3. So O(i+1), which is O(n) since i \u2264n.\n\nTherefore, in the worst case, the number of maximal cliques in a monopolar graph is linear in the number of vertices. Hence, the O complexity is O(n).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where a vertex in I is connected to multiple subsets of C, leading to more maximal cliques. But no, each vertex in I can only contribute one maximal clique (its neighborhood in C plus itself). Even if a vertex in I is connected to multiple different subsets, it's only the maximal one. Wait, no, because the neighborhood in C is fixed for each vertex in I. For a given v in I, N(v) is a subset of C, and the maximal clique is N(v) \u222a {v}, which is unique for each v. So each v in I contributes at most one maximal clique. \n\nTherefore, the total number of maximal cliques is O(n). Hence, the answer should be O(n), and the complexity is linear.",
