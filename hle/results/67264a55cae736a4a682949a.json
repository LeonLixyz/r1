  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to work through this question. So, the question is about an all-or-nothing vaccine and how the 1 minus incidence rate ratio (IRR) relates to per-exposure vaccine efficacy. Hmm. I need to recall what all-or-nothing vaccines are and how efficacy is calculated.\n\nAll-or-nothing vaccines, if I remember right, are vaccines where some individuals are completely protected (100% efficacy) and others get no protection. So, for example, maybe a certain percentage of vaccinated people are immune, and the rest are as susceptible as unvaccinated people. That's different from leaky vaccines, where everyone gets partial protection.\n\nNow, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) is the ratio of the incidence in the vaccinated group to the incidence in the unvaccinated group. So IRR = (cases in vaccinated / person-time vaccinated) / (cases in unvaccinated / person-time unvaccinated). Then vaccine efficacy (VE) is often calculated as 1 - IRR. But the question is whether this 1-IRR overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy in the case of an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\nPer-exposure efficacy, I think, refers to the vaccine's effectiveness each time a person is exposed to the pathogen. In an all-or-nothing model, those who are protected have 100% efficacy per exposure, and the others have 0%. So overall, the per-exposure efficacy would be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are protected. Let's say the vaccine protects a fraction 'f' of the population. Then, per-exposure VE is f*100% + (1-f)*0% = f. Wait, but how does this relate to the 1-IRR?\n\nSuppose in a population where everyone is exposed once. For the unvaccinated, incidence is, say, 'c'. For vaccinated, it's (1-f)*c, because only the non-protected fraction gets infected. So IRR would be [(1-f)c]/c = 1-f. Then 1-IRR would be f. Which matches the per-exposure efficacy (since f is the per-exposure efficacy here). But wait, maybe this is under a scenario where everyone is exposed the same number of times. But if exposure varies or the vaccine affects susceptibility over multiple exposures, does that change things?\n\nWait, the problem here is about per-exposure vaccine efficacy. So in the all-or-nothing model, each time a person is exposed, their probability of infection is either 0 (if protected) or the same as unvaccinated (if not protected). So per-exposure, the efficacy for the individual is either 100% or 0%. But the population-level per-exposure efficacy would be the average reduction in risk per exposure. So if in the vaccinated group, each exposure has a risk of (1-f)*risk_unvaccinated, then the per-exposure VE is 1 - (risk_vaccinated/risk_unvaccinated) = 1 - (1-f) = f. Which again matches the 1 - IRR. Because the IRR here would be (1-f) * (cases in vaccinated) / (cases in unvaccinated). So 1-IRR is f, which is exactly the per-exposure efficacy. Therefore, when using 1-IRR, it correctly estimates the per-exposure VE if the vaccine is all-or-nothing. So the answer should be C, correctly estimate. But wait, is this always the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a nuance here. Let's think about when the all-or-nothing vaccine's effectiveness is calculated over multiple exposures. For example, if a person is exposed multiple times, the protected individuals never get infected, but the others might get infected on the first exposure. So the overall incidence could be lower in the vaccinated group because some people are completely protected, but for those not protected, their infection occurs at the first exposure. However, when calculating the IRR, which is over person-time, maybe if infections happen quickly in the non-protected group, the person-time at risk decreases. But I'm not sure how that affects the ratio.\n\nWait, the incidence rate ratio uses person-time in the denominator. Suppose in the vaccinated group, the non-protected individuals get infected quickly, so they exit the at-risk population earlier. This would reduce their person-time, leading to a higher incidence rate compared to if they stayed at risk longer. But in the all-or-nothing model, once a person is infected, they're no longer contributing person-time. So if the non-protected vaccinated individuals get infected immediately, their person-time is shorter. Let's say in the unvaccinated group, people are exposed over time. Suppose the infection rate is constant over time. For the vaccinated, the f fraction never get infected, contributing full person-time, while the 1-f get infected immediately, contributing very little person-time. So the person-time in the vaccinated group would be approximately f * total person-time of unvaccinated. The number of cases in vaccinated would be 1-f (assuming each non-protected person gets infected once). The IRR would be [(1-f) / (f * T)] / [ (cases_unvaccinated) / (T) ] assuming cases_unvaccinated is, say, N * T where N is the incidence rate. Wait, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, an example. Suppose in the unvaccinated group, the incidence rate is 10 cases per 100 person-years. If the vaccine is all-or-nothing with 80% protected. So, f=0.8. So, vaccinated group: 20% are unprotected. If all are followed for 1 year, then expected cases in vaccinated would be 20% of 10, which is 2 cases per 100 person-years. So IRR is 2/10 = 0.2. So 1-IRR is 0.8, which is equal to f. So that correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy (which is 80% in this case). So here, 1-IRR correctly estimates it.\n\nWait, but if the person-time in the vaccinated group is different? Suppose in the vaccinated group, the unprotected people get infected quickly, say within the first month. So their person-time is 1 month, whereas the protected contribute 12 months. So for 100 people: 80 contribute 12 months (960 person-months), 20 contribute 1 month (20 person-months). Total person-time is 980 person-months \u2248 81.67 person-years. Number of cases is 20. So incidence rate is 20 / 81.67 \u2248 0.245 per person-year. Unvaccinated incidence is 10 per 100 person-years, which is 0.1 per person-year. So IRR = 0.245 / 0.1 = 2.45. Wait, that can't be right. Then 1-IRR would be negative? That doesn't make sense. So this suggests a problem with my previous reasoning.\n\nWait, no. If the vaccinated group's incidence rate is higher than the unvaccinated, then IRR is greater than 1, which would imply that the vaccine increases risk, which isn't the case here. But in the example, the vaccinated group's incidence rate is 20 cases over 81.67 person-years, which is 0.245 cases per person-year. The unvaccinated is 0.1 cases per person-year. So IRR is 2.45, which would mean 1-IRR is negative, implying negative efficacy, but that's not the case. So this suggests that using the simple 1-IRR would not correctly estimate the per-exposure VE in this scenario. Wait, but in reality, why would the incidence rate in the vaccinated be higher?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me check again. If 20% of the vaccinated are unprotected, they get infected immediately. Suppose in the unvaccinated group, the incidence is 0.1 per person-year. So over a year, 10% get infected. But in the vaccinated group, 20% get infected immediately. So if the study follows people for 1 year, the vaccinated group's cases are 20 (since 20% of 100), but their person-time is: 80 people * 1 year + 20 people * (time until infection). If infections happen immediately, then the 20 people are infected at time 0, contributing 0 person-years. So total person-time is 80*1 =80 person-years. So incidence rate is 20 cases / 80 person-years = 0.25 per person-year. Unvaccinated is 0.1 per person-year. So IRR is 0.25 /0.1 =2.5, so 1-IRR is -1.5. That's clearly wrong. But the per-exposure VE is 80%, so this approach gives a VE of -150%, which is impossible. But that can't be right.\n\nWait, so what's going on here? The problem must be in the way the person-time is calculated. If the 20% of vaccinated are infected immediately, then in the real world, the calculation would not use person-time at risk. Because once they are infected, they are no longer at risk. So the person-time for the vaccinated group would be for the 80% who are immune: 80 person-years, and the 20% who got infected contribute 0 person-years (since they got infected immediately). Thus, incidence rate is 20 cases /80 person-years. The unvaccinated have 10 cases per 100 person-years (0.1 per person-year). So the IRR is (20/80)/ (10/100) )= (0.25)/(0.1) = 2.5. So 1 - IRR is -1.5, which is clearly wrong. But the true per-exposure efficacy is 80%, so this suggests that using 1-IRR in this case would not be correct. But why?\n\nAh, because the all-or-nothing vaccine leads to differential depletion of susceptibles. The incidence rate ratio calculation is affected by the fact that the susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group are quickly infected and removed from the at-risk population, leading to a lower person-time in the denominator. This makes the incidence rate in the vaccinated group appear higher than it would be if the susceptibles remained in the population longer. Hence, the IRR is higher (i.e., closer to 1 or even above 1), leading 1-IRR to underestimate the true per-exposure VE. Wait, in the example, 1-IRR is -1.5, which is a massive underestimate. But the true VE is 80%. So in this case, the 1-IRR approach gives a VE estimate that's way lower than actual. But how does this apply generally?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard VE formula (1 - IRR) assumes that the vaccine is \"leaky\" (i.e., reduces per-exposure risk by a certain factor) rather than all-or-nothing. If the vaccine is all-or-nothing, then the standard formula might not capture the true per-exposure efficacy correctly. Let me check some references in my mind. From what I recall, in an all-or-nothing vaccine, the vaccine efficacy based on the risk ratio (not the incidence rate ratio) would correctly estimate the proportion protected. Because risk ratio (RR) is (1-f)/1, so 1-RR = f. But if using the incidence rate ratio, which is (1-f)/ (1 - s), where s is the fraction of susceptibles in the unvaccinated group? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe in the example I had before, if we use risk ratio (cumulative incidence) instead of incidence rate, then it works. Let's see. Cumulative incidence in vaccinated is 20%, in unvaccinated 10% (assuming over the same period). Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps in the unvaccinated, cumulative incidence over the study period is, say, 10%, and in vaccinated, it's 20% * 10% (since only the 20% unprotected are at risk, and their risk is same as unvaccinated). Wait, that would be 20% * 10% = 2% cumulative incidence. Then risk ratio is 2%/10% = 0.2, so 1-RR = 0.8, which matches f=0.8. So in that case, using 1 - risk ratio correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy. But incidence rate ratio might not, because of the person-time issue.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the incidence rate ratio (1 - IRR). So in the example where using IRR leads to 1-IRR = -1.5, which is way off, but using risk ratio gives correct 0.8. The confusion here is whether the question is about risk ratio or incidence rate ratio. The question states \"1-incidence rate ratio\".\n\nSo in the all-or-nothing model, using 1-IRR would actually underestimate the per-exposure vaccine efficacy, because the IRR is higher than the actual risk ratio. Because the susceptible vaccinated individuals get infected quickly, leading to a higher incidence rate (cases per person-time) compared to the unvaccinated, which makes the IRR closer to 1, thus 1-IRR is lower than the true efficacy. Wait, but in my previous example, the IRR was 2.5, leading to 1-IRR being negative. Which is an underestimate. So in that case, 1-IRR is way lower than the true per-exposure efficacy.\n\nBut why would the IRR be higher than the risk ratio in this scenario? Because the vaccinated group's person-time is lower due to the rapid infection of susceptibles. So the incidence rate is higher in the vaccinated group (even though cumulative incidence is lower). Wait, in my example, the cumulative incidence in vaccinated was 20% (20 out of 100) and in unvaccinated 10% (10 out of 100), which would imply the vaccine increases risk, which isn't the case. Wait, that can't be. There's a problem here.\n\nWait, maybe my example is flawed. Let's correct it. Let's say the unvaccinated have a certain risk over the study period. Suppose the unvaccinated have a 50% cumulative incidence (say, over 1 year). The vaccine is all-or-nothing with 80% efficacy (f=0.8). So, in vaccinated, 20% are unprotected. So their cumulative incidence would be 20% * 50% = 10% (since the unprotected have same risk as unvaccinated). So cumulative incidence in vaccinated is 10%, unvaccinated 50%. Risk ratio is 0.2, so 1 - RR = 0.8, which matches f. Now, let's compute the incidence rate ratio. Suppose in the unvaccinated group, 50 cases occur over 100 person-years (0.5 per person-year). For the vaccinated group, 10 cases. Now, the person-time in vaccinated: the 80% protected contribute 1 person-year each (80 person-years). The 20% unprotected: if they get infected halfway through the study period on average, their person-time is 0.5 years each. So total person-time for vaccinated is 80 + 20*0.5 = 90 person-years. Incidence rate is 10 /90 \u2248 0.111 per person-year. Unvaccinated is 50/100=0.5. IRR is 0.111/0.5 \u2248 0.222. 1 - IRR \u2248 0.778, which is close to 0.8. So here, 1-IRR is approximately correct. But if the unprotected get infected very quickly (like immediately), then person-time for them is almost 0. So vaccinated person-time is 80 person-years. Cases=10. Incidence rate =10/80=0.125. IRR=0.125/0.5=0.25. 1-IRR=0.75. True per-exposure efficacy is 0.8. So here, 1-IRR (0.75) underestimates the true efficacy (0.8). Thus, the answer would be A. Overestimate, B. Underestimate, or C. Correctly estimate. In this case, 0.75 is less than 0.8, so underestimates. So the correct answer would be B. Underestimate.\n\nBut wait, in this example, the 1-IRR gives a lower VE than the true per-exposure VE (75% vs 80%). So the answer would be B. Underestimate.\n\nBut why does this happen? Because in the all-or-nothing model, the susceptible individuals are infected more quickly, leading to a lower person-time denominator for the vaccinated group, which increases the incidence rate (cases/person-time), making the IRR smaller (since their incidence rate is higher than their cumulative incidence would suggest). Wait, no. Let's see: in the example where susceptibles are infected immediately, the person-time is 80 person-years. Cases are 20 (wait, previous example had 20% of 100 people, 20 people, but cumulative incidence would be 20% of 50% perhaps?). Wait, maybe my examples are conflicting each other. Let me re-express.\n\nLet's take a different example. Suppose in a study period, the unvaccinated have 50 infections over 100 person-years (IR=0.5 per person-year). Vaccine is all-or-nothing with 80% protected (f=0.8). So in vaccinated, 20% are unprotected. These 20% are at risk. Assuming they have the same per-exposure risk as the unvaccinated. But since the vaccine is all-or-nothing, once they are exposed, they get infected immediately. So if the unvaccinated have 50 infections over 100 person-years, their incidence rate is 0.5 per person-year. For the vaccinated, the 20% susceptible have the same per-person-year incidence rate (0.5). So the expected number of cases in vaccinated would be 0.2 * 0.5 * person-time. Wait, but in reality, once they get infected, they leave the at-risk pool. Hmm, this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, consider a dynamic where the force of infection is constant over time. For the unvaccinated, the hazard rate (instantaneous risk) is \u03bb. For the vaccinated, the hazard rate is 0 for the protected (80%), and \u03bb for the 20% unprotected. So the overall hazard rate in the vaccinated group is 0.2\u03bb. The expected number of infections in the vaccinated over time t would be 0.2\u03bb * t. The person-time contributed by the vaccinated group is (0.8 * t) + (0.2 * t) = t. Because even the unprotected contribute person-time until they are infected. Wait, but if they are infected at time \u03c4 < t, then their person-time is \u03c4. So if the hazard is \u03bb, the expected time until infection for an unprotected individual is 1/\u03bb. So the expected person-time from the unprotected is 0.2 * (1/\u03bb). The protected contribute 0.8 * t.\n\nSo total person-time in vaccinated group is 0.8t + 0.2*(1/\u03bb). The number of cases is 0.2 * (\u03bb * t'), where t' is the expected time until infection for the unprotected, which is 1/\u03bb. So the number of cases is 0.2 * (\u03bb * (1/\u03bb)) = 0.2. So incidence rate is 0.2 / (0.8t + 0.2*(1/\u03bb)).\n\nIn the unvaccinated group, the incidence rate is \u03bb. The IRR is [0.2 / (0.8t + 0.2*(1/\u03bb))] / \u03bb = 0.2 / [\u03bb*(0.8t + 0.2*(1/\u03bb))] ) = 0.2 / (0.8\u03bb t + 0.2). \n\nIf the study period t is large (t >> 1/\u03bb), then the term 0.8\u03bb t dominates, so IRR \u2248 0.2 / (0.8\u03bb t). As t increases, IRR approaches zero, so 1-IRR approaches 1. But the true per-exposure VE is 0.8. So in this case, for long study periods, the IRR approaches zero, and 1-IRR approaches 1, which overestimates the true VE of 0.8. Hmm, but this contradicts previous example. So maybe the direction depends on the study duration?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that it underestimates. But I'm getting conflicting results based on different scenarios. This is confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that the all-or-nothing vaccine's efficacy estimated by 1-IRR depends on the study design and follow-up time. However, in general, the formula 1-IRR is derived under the assumption of a leaky vaccine (constant hazard ratio). If the vaccine is all-or-nothing, then the IRR-based VE (1-IRR) will be biased. But in which direction?\n\nI recall that when the vaccine effect is all-or-nothing, the incidence rate ratio approach (1 - IRR) tends to underestimate the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy. The reason is that the susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group are quickly infected, leading to a lower person-time at risk compared to the leaky model. This causes the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to be higher than it would be under the leaky assumption, thus making the IRR larger (closer to 1) and 1-IRR smaller than the true per-exposure efficacy.\n\nFor example, imagine in a leaky vaccine with 80% efficacy, each exposure is reduced by 80%. So the incidence rate in the vaccinated is 0.2 times the unvaccinated. 1-IRR = 0.8, correctly reflecting per-exposure efficacy. But in the all-or-nothing model, if 80% are protected, the incidence rate is 0.2 times the unvaccinated only if the person-time isn't affected. But in reality, the 20% unprotected get infected quickly, reducing their person-time. So their incidence rate would be higher than 0.2. Let's say unvaccinated have 100 cases in 100 person-years (IR=1). Vaccinated: 20 cases (from 20% unprotected). Person-time for vaccinated: 80*1 + 20*(average time until infection). If the unvaccinated have IR=1, that's a hazard rate of 1 per person-year. For the unprotected vaccinated, time until infection would be exponentially distributed with \u03bb=1. Mean time is 1 year. So person-time for vaccinated is 80 + 20*1 = 100 person-years. Then IR is 20/100=0.2, same as unvaccinated IR=1. So IRR=0.2/1=0.2, 1-IRR=0.8. Matches per-exposure VE. But this is only if the unprotected have the same hazard rate as unvaccinated and are followed until infection. But in reality, if the study has a fixed follow-up period, say 1 year. Unvaccinated: 100 people contribute 100 person-years, with 100*1*(1 - e^{-1*1}) \u2248 63 cases. Vaccinated: 80 protected contribute 80 person-years, 20 unprotected contribute 20 person-years. Cases in vaccinated: 20*(1 - e^{-1*1}) \u2248 12.6 cases. So IRR is (12.6/(80+20)) / (63/100) = (12.6/100)/(0.63) = 0.126/0.63 =0.2. 1-IRR =0.8. So again, correct. But this is under continuous time with exponential distribution. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the assumption of exponential distribution is key here. If infection times are exponentially distributed, then the IRR-based VE (1-IRR) correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy even in all-or-nothing vaccines. But if the vaccine changes the time to infection in a non-exponential way, maybe there's a bias. But under the standard assumption of constant hazard (exponential distribution), then IRR-based VE would correctly estimate the per-exposure efficacy even for all-or-nothing vaccines. Hmmm.\n\nThis seems contradictory to earlier examples. Perhaps the key here is that when you use the incidence rate ratio under the assumption of proportional hazards (constant hazard ratio), the 1 - IRR gives the correct per-exposure efficacy even for all-or-nothing vaccines. Because in that case, the person-time is accounted for correctly. But if the hazard ratio is not constant (e.g., because susceptible vaccinated individuals get infected immediately), then the IRR would be affected. But in the all-or-nothing model, the hazard rate for the vaccinated is either 0 (protected) or same as unvaccinated (unprotected). So the overall hazard rate is 0.2\u03bb (if 20% are unprotected). Thus, the hazard ratio is 0.2. So IRR is 0.2, and 1 - IRR =0.8. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the earlier example where the unprotected get infected immediately, causing their person-time to be near zero, but that scenario would require a non-constant hazard. For example, if all susceptible vaccinated individuals are infected at time 0, their person-time is zero. Then IRR would be (number of cases in vaccinated)/(person-time vaccinated) / (cases in unvaccinated/person-time unvaccinated). If vaccinated have 20 cases, 80 person-years, unvaccinated have 100 cases over 100 person-years. Then IRR is (20/80)/(100/100) = 0.25 /1=0.25. 1 - IRR=0.75. Which is less than the true per-exposure VE of 0.8. So in this case, it underestimates. But why does this happen?\n\nBecause the distribution of infection times in the vaccinated is not exponential. In reality, if the vaccine causes susceptible individuals to be infected immediately, the hazard rate isn't constant. In the first moment, the hazard is very high, then drops to zero. This violates the proportional hazards assumption. Hence, the IRR is no longer a good estimate of the hazard ratio. \n\nIn standard epidemiological models, when the hazard ratio is constant (proportional hazards), IRR estimates the hazard ratio, and 1-IRR gives the per-exposure VE. But if the hazard ratio is not constant (as in all-or-nothing vaccines where susceptibles are infected immediately), the IRR may not correspond to the true per-exposure VE.\n\nTherefore, in the all-or-nothing model, if the vaccine's protection leads to a non-constant hazard ratio (i.e., susceptibles get infected instantly), the incidence rate ratio (IRR) will be higher than the true per-exposure efficacy would suggest. Hence, 1-IRR would be lower than the true per-exposure VE, leading to an underestimate.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's refer to some theoretical framework. Halloran et al. 1996 (reference in my mind) discuss different vaccine efficacy measures. They mention that when using hazard ratio-based measures (like IRR) for all-or-nothing vaccines, the measures may differ from the true biological efficacy.\n\nIn particular, the 'leaky' vaccine's efficacy over multiple exposures would align with the hazard ratio (VE = 1 - IRR). However, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, where a fraction f is completely protected, the true per-exposure efficacy is f. But the IRR would be (1 - f) * (\u03bb / \u03bb) =1 - f, because the susceptible vaccinated have the same \u03bb as unvaccinated. But the person-time for vaccinated is same as unvaccinated (assuming no depletion of susceptibles), then IRR is 1 - f, and 1 - IRR is f. So correct. But if the person-time is affected (depletion of susceptibles in vaccinated), then IRR becomes ( (1 - f) * \u03bb ) / \u03bb * ( S(t) vaccinated / S(t) unvaccinated )?), making it more complicated.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Given the time I have, perhaps the correct answer is C, correctly estimate. But in my earlier example where susceptibles are infected immediately, the answer would be B. Underestimate.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that in the all-or-nothing model, the per-exposure vaccine efficacy is the fraction protected (f), and the 1-IRR equals f, hence correctly estimates it. But this holds only if the person-time is not differentially affected, which would require that the study duration is such that the susceptible individuals in both groups contribute similarly to person-time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is A. Overestimate. Because the incidence rate ratio would be lower than expected, making 1-IRR higher. Wait, no. If the IRR is lower, 1-IRR would be higher. For example, if true VE is 80%, but IRR=0.1, then 1-IRR=0.9, which overestimates. But how does all-or-nothing affect this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is C. Correctly estimate. Because in expectation, under steady-state, the IRR would be 1 - f, thus 1-IRR is f, which matches the per-exposure VE. So the answer is C. But earlier examples contradicted this.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the correct answer is C. Correctly estimate. Because in the all-or-nothing model, the per-exposure VE is the proportion protected (f), and the 1-IRR equals f as well. For example, if f=0.8, then the IRR is 0.2 (since 20% get infected), so 1-IRR=0.8. Therefore, correctly estimates. Unless the person-time is affected, but in standard calculations where person-time is accounted for, IRR would correctly capture it. \n\nBut earlier example with immediate infection of susceptibles suggested otherwise. Maybe the key is whether the analysis is done in a cohort study with complete follow-up, where person-time is adjusted for time until event. In that case, the IRR would correctly reflect the hazard ratio, which is 1 - f. Hence, 1-IRR =f. So answer C. \n\nHowever, in practice, if the all-or-nothing vaccine leads to differential dropout of susceptibles, such as in a field study where vaccinated individuals leave the at-risk population faster, then the IRR calculation might be biased. But the question is theoretical, not based on real-world study designs. The question is about per-exposure VE and whether 1-IRR overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates it for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\nIn the theoretical model, per-exposure VE is f (probability that the vaccine protects per exposure), and the IRR is (1-f), so 1-IRR is f. Hence, correctly estimates. Therefore, answer C. \n\nBut why then in some examples does this not hold? Because those examples have non-exponential time-to-event, but in the standard model assuming constant hazards, it does hold. Hence, the answer is C. \n\nBut I'm still confused. Maybe I should conclude that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the 1-IRR correctly estimates the per-exposure VE, because the incidence rate ratio equals (1-f), so 1-IRR =f. Hence, the answer is C. Confidence maybe 70%. Because some of the examples suggested otherwise, but perhaps those examples had flawed assumptions.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: For an all-or-nothing vaccine, a fraction \\( f \\) of the vaccinated population is completely protected (100% efficacy), while the remaining \\( 1-f \\) have no protection.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. So, the question is about an all-or-nothing vaccine and how the 1 minus incidence rate ratio (IRR) relates to per-exposure vaccine efficacy. Hmm. I need to recall what all-or-nothing vaccines are and how efficacy is calculated.\n\nAll-or-nothing vaccines, if I remember right, are vaccines where some individuals are completely protected (100% efficacy) and others get no protection. So, for example, maybe a certain percentage of vaccinated people are immune, and the rest are as susceptible as unvaccinated people. That's different from leaky vaccines, where everyone gets partial protection.\n\nNow, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) is the ratio of the incidence in the vaccinated group to the incidence in the unvaccinated group. So IRR = (cases in vaccinated / person-time vaccinated) / (cases in unvaccinated / person-time unvaccinated). Then vaccine efficacy (VE) is often calculated as 1 - IRR. But the question is whether this 1-IRR overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy in the case of an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\nPer-exposure efficacy, I think, refers to the vaccine's effectiveness each time a person is exposed to the pathogen. In an all-or-nothing model, those who are protected have 100% efficacy per exposure, and the others have 0%. So overall, the per-exposure efficacy would be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are protected. Let's say the vaccine protects a fraction 'f' of the population. Then, per-exposure VE is f*100% + (1-f)*0% = f. Wait, but how does this relate to the 1-IRR?\n\nSuppose in a population where everyone is exposed once. For the unvaccinated, incidence is, say, 'c'. For vaccinated, it's (1-f)*c, because only the non-protected fraction gets infected. So IRR would be [(1-f)c]/c = 1-f. Then 1-IRR would be f. Which matches the per-exposure efficacy (since f is the per-exposure efficacy here). But wait, maybe this is under a scenario where everyone is exposed the same number of times. But if exposure varies or the vaccine affects susceptibility over multiple exposures, does that change things?\n\nWait, the problem here is about per-exposure vaccine efficacy. So in the all-or-nothing model, each time a person is exposed, their probability of infection is either 0 (if protected) or the same as unvaccinated (if not protected). So per-exposure, the efficacy for the individual is either 100% or 0%. But the population-level per-exposure efficacy would be the average reduction in risk per exposure. So if in the vaccinated group, each exposure has a risk of (1-f)*risk_unvaccinated, then the per-exposure VE is 1 - (risk_vaccinated/risk_unvaccinated) = 1 - (1-f) = f. Which again matches the 1 - IRR. Because the IRR here would be (1-f) * (cases in vaccinated) / (cases in unvaccinated). So 1-IRR is f, which is exactly the per-exposure efficacy. Therefore, when using 1-IRR, it correctly estimates the per-exposure VE if the vaccine is all-or-nothing. So the answer should be C, correctly estimate. But wait, is this always the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a nuance here. Let's think about when the all-or-nothing vaccine's effectiveness is calculated over multiple exposures. For example, if a person is exposed multiple times, the protected individuals never get infected, but the others might get infected on the first exposure. So the overall incidence could be lower in the vaccinated group because some people are completely protected, but for those not protected, their infection occurs at the first exposure. However, when calculating the IRR, which is over person-time, maybe if infections happen quickly in the non-protected group, the person-time at risk decreases. But I'm not sure how that affects the ratio.\n\nWait, the incidence rate ratio uses person-time in the denominator. Suppose in the vaccinated group, the non-protected individuals get infected quickly, so they exit the at-risk population earlier. This would reduce their person-time, leading to a higher incidence rate compared to if they stayed at risk longer. But in the all-or-nothing model, once a person is infected, they're no longer contributing person-time. So if the non-protected vaccinated individuals get infected immediately, their person-time is shorter. Let's say in the unvaccinated group, people are exposed over time. Suppose the infection rate is constant over time. For the vaccinated, the f fraction never get infected, contributing full person-time, while the 1-f get infected immediately, contributing very little person-time. So the person-time in the vaccinated group would be approximately f * total person-time of unvaccinated. The number of cases in vaccinated would be 1-f (assuming each non-protected person gets infected once). The IRR would be [(1-f) / (f * T)] / [ (cases_unvaccinated) / (T) ] assuming cases_unvaccinated is, say, N * T where N is the incidence rate. Wait, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, an example. Suppose in the unvaccinated group, the incidence rate is 10 cases per 100 person-years. If the vaccine is all-or-nothing with 80% protected. So, f=0.8. So, vaccinated group: 20% are unprotected. If all are followed for 1 year, then expected cases in vaccinated would be 20% of 10, which is 2 cases per 100 person-years. So IRR is 2/10 = 0.2. So 1-IRR is 0.8, which is equal to f. So that correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy (which is 80% in this case). So here, 1-IRR correctly estimates it.\n\nWait, but if the person-time in the vaccinated group is different? Suppose in the vaccinated group, the unprotected people get infected quickly, say within the first month. So their person-time is 1 month, whereas the protected contribute 12 months. So for 100 people: 80 contribute 12 months (960 person-months), 20 contribute 1 month (20 person-months). Total person-time is 980 person-months \u2248 81.67 person-years. Number of cases is 20. So incidence rate is 20 / 81.67 \u2248 0.245 per person-year. Unvaccinated incidence is 10 per 100 person-years, which is 0.1 per person-year. So IRR = 0.245 / 0.1 = 2.45. Wait, that can't be right. Then 1-IRR would be negative? That doesn't make sense. So this suggests a problem with my previous reasoning.\n\nWait, no. If the vaccinated group's incidence rate is higher than the unvaccinated, then IRR is greater than 1, which would imply that the vaccine increases risk, which isn't the case here. But in the example, the vaccinated group's incidence rate is 20 cases over 81.67 person-years, which is 0.245 cases per person-year. The unvaccinated is 0.1 cases per person-year. So IRR is 2.45, which would mean 1-IRR is negative, implying negative efficacy, but that's not the case. So this suggests that using the simple 1-IRR would not correctly estimate the per-exposure VE in this scenario. Wait, but in reality, why would the incidence rate in the vaccinated be higher?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me check again. If 20% of the vaccinated are unprotected, they get infected immediately. Suppose in the unvaccinated group, the incidence is 0.1 per person-year. So over a year, 10% get infected. But in the vaccinated group, 20% get infected immediately. So if the study follows people for 1 year, the vaccinated group's cases are 20 (since 20% of 100), but their person-time is: 80 people * 1 year + 20 people * (time until infection). If infections happen immediately, then the 20 people are infected at time 0, contributing 0 person-years. So total person-time is 80*1 =80 person-years. So incidence rate is 20 cases / 80 person-years = 0.25 per person-year. Unvaccinated is 0.1 per person-year. So IRR is 0.25 /0.1 =2.5, so 1-IRR is -1.5. That's clearly wrong. But the per-exposure VE is 80%, so this approach gives a VE of -150%, which is impossible. But that can't be right.\n\nWait, so what's going on here? The problem must be in the way the person-time is calculated. If the 20% of vaccinated are infected immediately, then in the real world, the calculation would not use person-time at risk. Because once they are infected, they are no longer at risk. So the person-time for the vaccinated group would be for the 80% who are immune: 80 person-years, and the 20% who got infected contribute 0 person-years (since they got infected immediately). Thus, incidence rate is 20 cases /80 person-years. The unvaccinated have 10 cases per 100 person-years (0.1 per person-year). So the IRR is (20/80)/ (10/100) )= (0.25)/(0.1) = 2.5. So 1 - IRR is -1.5, which is clearly wrong. But the true per-exposure efficacy is 80%, so this suggests that using 1-IRR in this case would not be correct. But why?\n\nAh, because the all-or-nothing vaccine leads to differential depletion of susceptibles. The incidence rate ratio calculation is affected by the fact that the susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group are quickly infected and removed from the at-risk population, leading to a lower person-time in the denominator. This makes the incidence rate in the vaccinated group appear higher than it would be if the susceptibles remained in the population longer. Hence, the IRR is higher (i.e., closer to 1 or even above 1), leading 1-IRR to underestimate the true per-exposure VE. Wait, in the example, 1-IRR is -1.5, which is a massive underestimate. But the true VE is 80%. So in this case, the 1-IRR approach gives a VE estimate that's way lower than actual. But how does this apply generally?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard VE formula (1 - IRR) assumes that the vaccine is \"leaky\" (i.e., reduces per-exposure risk by a certain factor) rather than all-or-nothing. If the vaccine is all-or-nothing, then the standard formula might not capture the true per-exposure efficacy correctly. Let me check some references in my mind. From what I recall, in an all-or-nothing vaccine, the vaccine efficacy based on the risk ratio (not the incidence rate ratio) would correctly estimate the proportion protected. Because risk ratio (RR) is (1-f)/1, so 1-RR = f. But if using the incidence rate ratio, which is (1-f)/ (1 - s), where s is the fraction of susceptibles in the unvaccinated group? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe in the example I had before, if we use risk ratio (cumulative incidence) instead of incidence rate, then it works. Let's see. Cumulative incidence in vaccinated is 20%, in unvaccinated 10% (assuming over the same period). Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps in the unvaccinated, cumulative incidence over the study period is, say, 10%, and in vaccinated, it's 20% * 10% (since only the 20% unprotected are at risk, and their risk is same as unvaccinated). Wait, that would be 20% * 10% = 2% cumulative incidence. Then risk ratio is 2%/10% = 0.2, so 1-RR = 0.8, which matches f=0.8. So in that case, using 1 - risk ratio correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy. But incidence rate ratio might not, because of the person-time issue.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the incidence rate ratio (1 - IRR). So in the example where using IRR leads to 1-IRR = -1.5, which is way off, but using risk ratio gives correct 0.8. The confusion here is whether the question is about risk ratio or incidence rate ratio. The question states \"1-incidence rate ratio\".\n\nSo in the all-or-nothing model, using 1-IRR would actually underestimate the per-exposure vaccine efficacy, because the IRR is higher than the actual risk ratio. Because the susceptible vaccinated individuals get infected quickly, leading to a higher incidence rate (cases per person-time) compared to the unvaccinated, which makes the IRR closer to 1, thus 1-IRR is lower than the true efficacy. Wait, but in my previous example, the IRR was 2.5, leading to 1-IRR being negative. Which is an underestimate. So in that case, 1-IRR is way lower than the true per-exposure efficacy.\n\nBut why would the IRR be higher than the risk ratio in this scenario? Because the vaccinated group's person-time is lower due to the rapid infection of susceptibles. So the incidence rate is higher in the vaccinated group (even though cumulative incidence is lower). Wait, in my example, the cumulative incidence in vaccinated was 20% (20 out of 100) and in unvaccinated 10% (10 out of 100), which would imply the vaccine increases risk, which isn't the case. Wait, that can't be. There's a problem here.\n\nWait, maybe my example is flawed. Let's correct it. Let's say the unvaccinated have a certain risk over the study period. Suppose the unvaccinated have a 50% cumulative incidence (say, over 1 year). The vaccine is all-or-nothing with 80% efficacy (f=0.8). So, in vaccinated, 20% are unprotected. So their cumulative incidence would be 20% * 50% = 10% (since the unprotected have same risk as unvaccinated). So cumulative incidence in vaccinated is 10%, unvaccinated 50%. Risk ratio is 0.2, so 1 - RR = 0.8, which matches f. Now, let's compute the incidence rate ratio. Suppose in the unvaccinated group, 50 cases occur over 100 person-years (0.5 per person-year). For the vaccinated group, 10 cases. Now, the person-time in vaccinated: the 80% protected contribute 1 person-year each (80 person-years). The 20% unprotected: if they get infected halfway through the study period on average, their person-time is 0.5 years each. So total person-time for vaccinated is 80 + 20*0.5 = 90 person-years. Incidence rate is 10 /90 \u2248 0.111 per person-year. Unvaccinated is 50/100=0.5. IRR is 0.111/0.5 \u2248 0.222. 1 - IRR \u2248 0.778, which is close to 0.8. So here, 1-IRR is approximately correct. But if the unprotected get infected very quickly (like immediately), then person-time for them is almost 0. So vaccinated person-time is 80 person-years. Cases=10. Incidence rate =10/80=0.125. IRR=0.125/0.5=0.25. 1-IRR=0.75. True per-exposure efficacy is 0.8. So here, 1-IRR (0.75) underestimates the true efficacy (0.8). Thus, the answer would be A. Overestimate, B. Underestimate, or C. Correctly estimate. In this case, 0.75 is less than 0.8, so underestimates. So the correct answer would be B. Underestimate.\n\nBut wait, in this example, the 1-IRR gives a lower VE than the true per-exposure VE (75% vs 80%). So the answer would be B. Underestimate.\n\nBut why does this happen? Because in the all-or-nothing model, the susceptible individuals are infected more quickly, leading to a lower person-time denominator for the vaccinated group, which increases the incidence rate (cases/person-time), making the IRR smaller (since their incidence rate is higher than their cumulative incidence would suggest). Wait, no. Let's see: in the example where susceptibles are infected immediately, the person-time is 80 person-years. Cases are 20 (wait, previous example had 20% of 100 people, 20 people, but cumulative incidence would be 20% of 50% perhaps?). Wait, maybe my examples are conflicting each other. Let me re-express.\n\nLet's take a different example. Suppose in a study period, the unvaccinated have 50 infections over 100 person-years (IR=0.5 per person-year). Vaccine is all-or-nothing with 80% protected (f=0.8). So in vaccinated, 20% are unprotected. These 20% are at risk. Assuming they have the same per-exposure risk as the unvaccinated. But since the vaccine is all-or-nothing, once they are exposed, they get infected immediately. So if the unvaccinated have 50 infections over 100 person-years, their incidence rate is 0.5 per person-year. For the vaccinated, the 20% susceptible have the same per-person-year incidence rate (0.5). So the expected number of cases in vaccinated would be 0.2 * 0.5 * person-time. Wait, but in reality, once they get infected, they leave the at-risk pool. Hmm, this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, consider a dynamic where the force of infection is constant over time. For the unvaccinated, the hazard rate (instantaneous risk) is \u03bb. For the vaccinated, the hazard rate is 0 for the protected (80%), and \u03bb for the 20% unprotected. So the overall hazard rate in the vaccinated group is 0.2\u03bb. The expected number of infections in the vaccinated over time t would be 0.2\u03bb * t. The person-time contributed by the vaccinated group is (0.8 * t) + (0.2 * t) = t. Because even the unprotected contribute person-time until they are infected. Wait, but if they are infected at time \u03c4 < t, then their person-time is \u03c4. So if the hazard is \u03bb, the expected time until infection for an unprotected individual is 1/\u03bb. So the expected person-time from the unprotected is 0.2 * (1/\u03bb). The protected contribute 0.8 * t.\n\nSo total person-time in vaccinated group is 0.8t + 0.2*(1/\u03bb). The number of cases is 0.2 * (\u03bb * t'), where t' is the expected time until infection for the unprotected, which is 1/\u03bb. So the number of cases is 0.2 * (\u03bb * (1/\u03bb)) = 0.2. So incidence rate is 0.2 / (0.8t + 0.2*(1/\u03bb)).\n\nIn the unvaccinated group, the incidence rate is \u03bb. The IRR is [0.2 / (0.8t + 0.2*(1/\u03bb))] / \u03bb = 0.2 / [\u03bb*(0.8t + 0.2*(1/\u03bb))] ) = 0.2 / (0.8\u03bb t + 0.2). \n\nIf the study period t is large (t >> 1/\u03bb), then the term 0.8\u03bb t dominates, so IRR \u2248 0.2 / (0.8\u03bb t). As t increases, IRR approaches zero, so 1-IRR approaches 1. But the true per-exposure VE is 0.8. So in this case, for long study periods, the IRR approaches zero, and 1-IRR approaches 1, which overestimates the true VE of 0.8. Hmm, but this contradicts previous example. So maybe the direction depends on the study duration?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that it underestimates. But I'm getting conflicting results based on different scenarios. This is confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that the all-or-nothing vaccine's efficacy estimated by 1-IRR depends on the study design and follow-up time. However, in general, the formula 1-IRR is derived under the assumption of a leaky vaccine (constant hazard ratio). If the vaccine is all-or-nothing, then the IRR-based VE (1-IRR) will be biased. But in which direction?\n\nI recall that when the vaccine effect is all-or-nothing, the incidence rate ratio approach (1 - IRR) tends to underestimate the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy. The reason is that the susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group are quickly infected, leading to a lower person-time at risk compared to the leaky model. This causes the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to be higher than it would be under the leaky assumption, thus making the IRR larger (closer to 1) and 1-IRR smaller than the true per-exposure efficacy.\n\nFor example, imagine in a leaky vaccine with 80% efficacy, each exposure is reduced by 80%. So the incidence rate in the vaccinated is 0.2 times the unvaccinated. 1-IRR = 0.8, correctly reflecting per-exposure efficacy. But in the all-or-nothing model, if 80% are protected, the incidence rate is 0.2 times the unvaccinated only if the person-time isn't affected. But in reality, the 20% unprotected get infected quickly, reducing their person-time. So their incidence rate would be higher than 0.2. Let's say unvaccinated have 100 cases in 100 person-years (IR=1). Vaccinated: 20 cases (from 20% unprotected). Person-time for vaccinated: 80*1 + 20*(average time until infection). If the unvaccinated have IR=1, that's a hazard rate of 1 per person-year. For the unprotected vaccinated, time until infection would be exponentially distributed with \u03bb=1. Mean time is 1 year. So person-time for vaccinated is 80 + 20*1 = 100 person-years. Then IR is 20/100=0.2, same as unvaccinated IR=1. So IRR=0.2/1=0.2, 1-IRR=0.8. Matches per-exposure VE. But this is only if the unprotected have the same hazard rate as unvaccinated and are followed until infection. But in reality, if the study has a fixed follow-up period, say 1 year. Unvaccinated: 100 people contribute 100 person-years, with 100*1*(1 - e^{-1*1}) \u2248 63 cases. Vaccinated: 80 protected contribute 80 person-years, 20 unprotected contribute 20 person-years. Cases in vaccinated: 20*(1 - e^{-1*1}) \u2248 12.6 cases. So IRR is (12.6/(80+20)) / (63/100) = (12.6/100)/(0.63) = 0.126/0.63 =0.2. 1-IRR =0.8. So again, correct. But this is under continuous time with exponential distribution. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the assumption of exponential distribution is key here. If infection times are exponentially distributed, then the IRR-based VE (1-IRR) correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy even in all-or-nothing vaccines. But if the vaccine changes the time to infection in a non-exponential way, maybe there's a bias. But under the standard assumption of constant hazard (exponential distribution), then IRR-based VE would correctly estimate the per-exposure efficacy even for all-or-nothing vaccines. Hmmm.\n\nThis seems contradictory to earlier examples. Perhaps the key here is that when you use the incidence rate ratio under the assumption of proportional hazards (constant hazard ratio), the 1 - IRR gives the correct per-exposure efficacy even for all-or-nothing vaccines. Because in that case, the person-time is accounted for correctly. But if the hazard ratio is not constant (e.g., because susceptible vaccinated individuals get infected immediately), then the IRR would be affected. But in the all-or-nothing model, the hazard rate for the vaccinated is either 0 (protected) or same as unvaccinated (unprotected). So the overall hazard rate is 0.2\u03bb (if 20% are unprotected). Thus, the hazard ratio is 0.2. So IRR is 0.2, and 1 - IRR =0.8. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the earlier example where the unprotected get infected immediately, causing their person-time to be near zero, but that scenario would require a non-constant hazard. For example, if all susceptible vaccinated individuals are infected at time 0, their person-time is zero. Then IRR would be (number of cases in vaccinated)/(person-time vaccinated) / (cases in unvaccinated/person-time unvaccinated). If vaccinated have 20 cases, 80 person-years, unvaccinated have 100 cases over 100 person-years. Then IRR is (20/80)/(100/100) = 0.25 /1=0.25. 1 - IRR=0.75. Which is less than the true per-exposure VE of 0.8. So in this case, it underestimates. But why does this happen?\n\nBecause the distribution of infection times in the vaccinated is not exponential. In reality, if the vaccine causes susceptible individuals to be infected immediately, the hazard rate isn't constant. In the first moment, the hazard is very high, then drops to zero. This violates the proportional hazards assumption. Hence, the IRR is no longer a good estimate of the hazard ratio. \n\nIn standard epidemiological models, when the hazard ratio is constant (proportional hazards), IRR estimates the hazard ratio, and 1-IRR gives the per-exposure VE. But if the hazard ratio is not constant (as in all-or-nothing vaccines where susceptibles are infected immediately), the IRR may not correspond to the true per-exposure VE.\n\nTherefore, in the all-or-nothing model, if the vaccine's protection leads to a non-constant hazard ratio (i.e., susceptibles get infected instantly), the incidence rate ratio (IRR) will be higher than the true per-exposure efficacy would suggest. Hence, 1-IRR would be lower than the true per-exposure VE, leading to an underestimate.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's refer to some theoretical framework. Halloran et al. 1996 (reference in my mind) discuss different vaccine efficacy measures. They mention that when using hazard ratio-based measures (like IRR) for all-or-nothing vaccines, the measures may differ from the true biological efficacy.\n\nIn particular, the 'leaky' vaccine's efficacy over multiple exposures would align with the hazard ratio (VE = 1 - IRR). However, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, where a fraction f is completely protected, the true per-exposure efficacy is f. But the IRR would be (1 - f) * (\u03bb / \u03bb) =1 - f, because the susceptible vaccinated have the same \u03bb as unvaccinated. But the person-time for vaccinated is same as unvaccinated (assuming no depletion of susceptibles), then IRR is 1 - f, and 1 - IRR is f. So correct. But if the person-time is affected (depletion of susceptibles in vaccinated), then IRR becomes ( (1 - f) * \u03bb ) / \u03bb * ( S(t) vaccinated / S(t) unvaccinated )?), making it more complicated.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Given the time I have, perhaps the correct answer is C, correctly estimate. But in my earlier example where susceptibles are infected immediately, the answer would be B. Underestimate.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that in the all-or-nothing model, the per-exposure vaccine efficacy is the fraction protected (f), and the 1-IRR equals f, hence correctly estimates it. But this holds only if the person-time is not differentially affected, which would require that the study duration is such that the susceptible individuals in both groups contribute similarly to person-time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is A. Overestimate. Because the incidence rate ratio would be lower than expected, making 1-IRR higher. Wait, no. If the IRR is lower, 1-IRR would be higher. For example, if true VE is 80%, but IRR=0.1, then 1-IRR=0.9, which overestimates. But how does all-or-nothing affect this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is C. Correctly estimate. Because in expectation, under steady-state, the IRR would be 1 - f, thus 1-IRR is f, which matches the per-exposure VE. So the answer is C. But earlier examples contradicted this.\n\nAfter struggling, I think the correct answer is C. Correctly estimate. Because in the all-or-nothing model, the per-exposure VE is the proportion protected (f), and the 1-IRR equals f as well. For example, if f=0.8, then the IRR is 0.2 (since 20% get infected), so 1-IRR=0.8. Therefore, correctly estimates. Unless the person-time is affected, but in standard calculations where person-time is accounted for, IRR would correctly capture it. \n\nBut earlier example with immediate infection of susceptibles suggested otherwise. Maybe the key is whether the analysis is done in a cohort study with complete follow-up, where person-time is adjusted for time until event. In that case, the IRR would correctly reflect the hazard ratio, which is 1 - f. Hence, 1-IRR =f. So answer C. \n\nHowever, in practice, if the all-or-nothing vaccine leads to differential dropout of susceptibles, such as in a field study where vaccinated individuals leave the at-risk population faster, then the IRR calculation might be biased. But the question is theoretical, not based on real-world study designs. The question is about per-exposure VE and whether 1-IRR overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates it for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\nIn the theoretical model, per-exposure VE is f (probability that the vaccine protects per exposure), and the IRR is (1-f), so 1-IRR is f. Hence, correctly estimates. Therefore, answer C. \n\nBut why then in some examples does this not hold? Because those examples have non-exponential time-to-event, but in the standard model assuming constant hazards, it does hold. Hence, the answer is C. \n\nBut I'm still confused. Maybe I should conclude that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the 1-IRR correctly estimates the per-exposure VE, because the incidence rate ratio equals (1-f), so 1-IRR =f. Hence, the answer is C. Confidence maybe 70%. Because some of the examples suggested otherwise, but perhaps those examples had flawed assumptions.",
