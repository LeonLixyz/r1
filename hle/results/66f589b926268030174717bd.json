  "question": "The curve is given in parametric form $x=\\cos t$, $y=b\\sin t$, where $b=1$ if $t\\in[0,\\pi]$ and $b=5$ if $t\\in(\\pi, 2\\pi)$. What is the area of the smallest square that outcircles the figure made by this curve?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have a parametric curve defined by x = cos t and y = b sin t. The parameter b is 1 when t is between 0 and \u03c0, and it's 5 when t is between \u03c0 and 2\u03c0. The question is asking for the area of the smallest square that can outcircle this figure. Hmm, so the square needs to completely contain the curve, right?\n\nFirst, I need to visualize what this curve looks like. Normally, if x = cos t and y = sin t, that's a circle with radius 1. But here, the y-component is scaled by b, which changes depending on the interval of t. So from t=0 to \u03c0 (which is the first half of the parameter interval), the curve is an ellipse with semi-major axis 1 in the x-direction and semi-minor axis 1 in the y-direction. Wait, that would just be a circle. But when t is between \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, the b becomes 5, so the y-component is scaled by 5. So in the lower half (since t from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0 would correspond to angles in the lower half of the unit circle), the y-coordinate becomes 5 sin t. But sin t is negative there, but since it's multiplied by 5, the magnitude is 5 times larger.\n\nWait, but parametric equations: when t is from 0 to \u03c0, x = cos t, y = sin t (since b=1). So that's a semicircle in the upper half (since sin t from 0 to \u03c0 is non-negative). Then from t=\u03c0 to 2\u03c0, x = cos t, y = 5 sin t. But here, sin t is between 0 and -1, so y is between 0 and -5. So the lower half of the curve is stretched vertically by a factor of 5. So overall, the figure is like a semicircle on top and a semi-ellipse on the bottom, stretched down to y = -5. But also, the x-component is always cos t, which ranges from 1 to -1 and back to 1 as t goes from 0 to 2\u03c0. Wait, but since the parameter t is split into two intervals, maybe the entire curve is a combination of two parts: upper semicircle and lower semi-ellipse.\n\nWait, but when t is in [0, \u03c0], x = cos t, y = sin t. That's the upper semicircle, radius 1, centered at the origin, from (1,0) up to (-1,0). Then when t is in (\u03c0, 2\u03c0], x = cos t, y = 5 sin t. But sin t here would be negative, so y ranges from 0 down to -5 and back to 0. So the lower part is a semi-ellipse with horizontal axis length 2 (since x goes from -1 to 1) and vertical axis from 0 to -5. So the entire shape is like a circle on top and a vertically stretched ellipse on the bottom.\n\nTo find the smallest square that can contain this figure, I need to determine the maximum and minimum x and y values the curve attains. Because the square needs to contain all points of the curve, so the square's sides must be at least as large as the maximum horizontal and vertical extents.\n\nLet's check the x-component. For all t, x = cos t. So x ranges from -1 to 1. So the horizontal extent is from x = -1 to x = 1, so total width is 2. So the square must have at least a width of 2. However, the vertical component is more variable. The upper part (t in [0, \u03c0]) has y from 0 to 1 (since sin t is between 0 and 1 here). The lower part (t in (\u03c0, 2\u03c0]) has y from 0 down to -5 (since sin t goes from 0 to -1, multiplied by 5 gives y down to -5). So the vertical extent is from y = 1 (maximum) to y = -5 (minimum). The total vertical distance is 6 units. But wait, the square must contain all these points, so the side length of the square must be determined by the larger of the horizontal and vertical extents.\n\nThe horizontal extent is 2 (from -1 to 1) and the vertical extent is 6 (from -5 to 1). Therefore, the square needs to have sides of at least 6 units to cover the vertical range. But wait, a square needs to have equal sides. If the vertical range is 6, then the square's side must be 6, but also check if the horizontal range can fit within that. Since the horizontal range is only 2 units, but if the square is of side length 6, then the horizontal side would be from -3 to 3, which is more than enough to contain the horizontal range of -1 to 1. Alternatively, maybe the square is axis-aligned? But the problem says the smallest square that outcircles the figure. Wait, outcircle usually means the square circumscribed around the figure, but maybe it's the minimal square (not necessarily axis-aligned) that can contain the figure. However, the problem might be expecting an axis-aligned square because it's simpler.\n\nWait, but the standard way to find the minimal square area would consider both axis-aligned and rotated squares. However, this is more complicated. But given the parametric equations, maybe the figure is symmetric about the y-axis but not the x-axis. So perhaps the maximal horizontal extent is from -1 to 1, and vertical from -5 to 1. So the total height is 6, and width 2. If the square is axis-aligned, then the side length must be 6, since the vertical dimension is larger. Thus, the area would be 6^2 = 36. But maybe there's a way to rotate the square so that a smaller square can contain the figure. But rotating the square might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the figure's diagonal is longer, so a rotated square can have a smaller side length. But that's more complex. Let me think. The figure's highest point is (0,1) and the lowest is (0,-5). The leftmost and rightmost points are (-1,0) and (1,0). So the figure's bounding box is from x=-1 to 1 (width 2) and y=-5 to 1 (height 6). If we use an axis-aligned square, the side length must be 6, area 36. But can a rotated square have a smaller area? Let's compute the maximal distance in any direction.\n\nThe figure's extreme points are (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-5). The furthest points from each other are (0,-5) and (0,1), distance 6. Then (1,0) and (-1,0), distance 2. The diagonal of the minimal axis-aligned square would be 6 units, but if we rotate the square such that its sides align along the diagonals, maybe the side length can be minimized. However, calculating the minimal enclosing square for an arbitrary shape is non-trivial. But perhaps in this case, the minimal square is axis-aligned because the vertical extent is much larger. Alternatively, maybe the diagonal of the bounding box is sqrt( (2)^2 + (6)^2 ) = sqrt(40) \u2248 6.324. If the square is rotated, the side length would be the maximum of the projections. But this might not yield a smaller area.\n\nWait, the area of a square enclosing the figure would depend on the side length. If the axis-aligned square has side length 6, area 36. If we can find a rotated square with a smaller side length, its area would be less. For example, if the minimal square is determined by the maximum distance between two points along a direction. But I think in this case, since the vertical extent is so much larger than the horizontal, the minimal square is axis-aligned. Let me check.\n\nSuppose we have a square that's rotated. The maximal horizontal and vertical distances would need to fit within the square's projections. But since the vertical distance is 6, which is larger than the horizontal 2, even if we rotate the square, the vertical component would require the square's side to be at least 6 / cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the square's side and the vertical axis. If theta is 0 (axis-aligned), then side length is 6. If theta increases, cos(theta) decreases, requiring a larger side length, so the area would be (6/cos(theta))\u00b2, which is larger. Therefore, the minimal area occurs when theta=0, i.e., axis-aligned. Therefore, the axis-aligned square with side length 6, area 36, is the minimal.\n\nBut wait, maybe another orientation allows the square to cover both the horizontal and vertical extents with a smaller side. For instance, if the square is placed such that its sides are not aligned with the axes but instead cover the figure's diagonal. Let's calculate the diagonal distance between (1,0) and (0,-5). The distance is sqrt(1^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(26) \u2248 5.1. Similarly, the distance between (-1,0) and (0,-5) is the same. The maximum distance across the figure might be between (0,1) and (0,-5), which is 6 units. But a square that contains the figure must have sides that can accommodate the furthest points. If we align the square such that one side is aligned with the line connecting (0,1) and (0,-5), then the side length would need to be 6. Alternatively, if we rotate the square to fit the diagonal, but that might not help here.\n\nWait, the maximum distance between any two points on the figure is 6 (from (0,1) to (0,-5)). The minimal square that can contain two points 6 units apart would have a side length of 6 (if aligned along the same line), so the area is 36. If the points are at some angle, then the side length might be 6 divided by cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the points and the square sides, leading to a larger area. Therefore, the minimal area is indeed 36 with an axis-aligned square.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 36, with confidence high. But let me double-check. The figure's highest point is (0,1), lowest (0,-5), leftmost (-1,0), rightmost (1,0). So the vertical span is from 1 to -5, which is 6 units. The horizontal span is from -1 to 1, which is 2 units. So the minimal axis-aligned square must have a side length equal to the maximum of these spans, which is 6. Hence, the area is 6\u00b2=36.\n",
