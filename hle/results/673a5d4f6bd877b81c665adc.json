  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x\u2074 +8x +14. Hmm, I remember that the Galois group's order is equal to the degree of the splitting field over the base field, which is usually the rationals here. So, first, maybe I should check if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a. Because if it factors, the Galois group might be smaller or have a different structure.\n\nLet me apply the Eisenstein's criterion. The polynomial is x\u2074 +8x +14. For Eisenstein, we need a prime number that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and the constant term isn't divisible by the square of that prime. Let's check primes. The constant term is 14, which factors into 2 and 7. Let's try p=2. Coefficients are 1 (x\u2074), 0 (x\u00b3), 0 (x\u00b2), 8 (x), 14. 2 divides 8 and 14, but the leading coefficient is 1, which 2 doesn't divide. Then, check if 2\u00b2 divides the constant term 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5, so no. So Eisenstein applies with p=2. Wait, but the coefficient of x is 8, which is divisible by 2, but the x\u2074 term's coefficient is 1, which isn't divisible by 2. So yes, Eisenstein works here. Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a. That means the Galois group is transitive, and the order is divisible by 4.\n\nSince the polynomial is quartic, the Galois group is a subgroup of S4. The possible orders for transitive subgroups of S4 are 4, 8, 12, 24. The groups are C4, V4, D4, A4, S4. Wait, but maybe I should check the discriminant to see if the group is a subgroup of A4. The discriminant of the polynomial can help determine if the Galois group is contained in A4 (if the discriminant is a square) or not.\n\nCalculating the discriminant of a quartic polynomial might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that if the polynomial is irreducible with exactly two real roots, then the Galois group contains a transposition, which combined with irreducibility (hence having a 4-cycle) would generate S4. But how do I check how many real roots this polynomial has?\n\nLet's consider f(x) = x\u2074 +8x +14. Compute its derivative: f\u2019(x) = 4x\u00b3 +8. Setting derivative to zero: 4x\u00b3 +8 =0 => x\u00b3 = -2 => x = -\u221b2 \u2248 -1.26. So the function has a critical point at x \u2248 -1.26. Let's evaluate f at this point. The real root of the derivative is x = -\u221b2. Plugging into f: (-\u221b2)^4 +8*(-\u221b2) +14. Let's compute each term:\n\n(-\u221b2)^4 = (\u221b2)^4 = (\u221b2)^3 * \u221b2 = 2 * \u221b2 \u2248 2.5198.\n\n8*(-\u221b2) \u2248 -8*1.26 \u2248 -10.08.\n\nSo total f(-\u221b2) \u2248 2.5198 -10.08 +14 \u2248 6.4398. So the function has a minimum at x=-\u221b2 of approximately 6.44, which is positive. Therefore, the function is always increasing except at the critical point where it has a local minimum. Since the minimum is positive, the function doesn't cross the x-axis here. Wait, but x\u2074 tends to infinity as x approaches \u00b1\u221e. So when x approaches +infty, x\u2074 dominates, so f(x) goes to +infty. When x approaches -infty, x\u2074 is positive and large, while 8x becomes very negative. Let's check f(-2): (-2)^4 +8*(-2) +14 = 16 -16 +14 =14. f(-3): 81 +8*(-3) +14=81-24+14=71. So for x negative, the function is positive. At x=0, f(0)=14. So all real roots? Wait, hold on. Wait, if the minimum value is positive, then the function never crosses the x-axis. So that would mean the polynomial has no real roots. But quartic with positive leading coefficient and tending to infinity on both ends, but with a positive minimum. So maybe it has no real roots? Wait, but x\u2074 +8x +14 at x approaching negative infinity: x\u2074 is positive, 8x is negative, but for very large negative x, x\u2074 dominates. So maybe f(-10^6) is a huge positive number. So the minimum at x=-\u221b2 is approximately 6.44, so the function is always above zero. Therefore, the polynomial has no real roots. So all roots are complex and come in conjugate pairs. So the splitting field has complex roots, which would require adjoining complex roots. So the Galois group must act on the four complex roots, which are two pairs of complex conjugates. \n\nSince the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a, the Galois group is transitive. The possible transitive subgroups of S4 for a quartic with no real roots... Hmm. Let's think. If there are two pairs of complex conjugate roots, say a, a', b, b', then the Galois group would have elements that permute these roots. The Galois group must have order divisible by 4 because it's irreducible. So possible groups could be the dihedral group D4 of order 8, or C4, or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe the Galois group is S4, but if all roots are complex, perhaps the Galois group is a dihedral group. Wait, but S4 has order 24. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute the resolvent cubic. For a quartic polynomial, the resolvent cubic can help determine the Galois group. Let me recall that for a quartic x\u2074 + a x\u00b3 + b x\u00b2 + c x + d, the resolvent cubic is x\u00b3 - b x\u00b2 + (ac -4d)x -a\u00b2 d +4b d -c\u00b2. Wait, but maybe I need to check the exact formula. Alternatively, for a quartic polynomial f(x) = x\u2074 + px\u00b3 + qx\u00b2 + rx + s, the resolvent cubic is x\u00b3 - qx\u00b2 + (pr -4s)x + (4qs -p\u00b2 s - r\u00b2). Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the resolvent cubic is derived from the roots. Let me see. If the quartic is x\u2074 + a x\u00b3 + b x\u00b2 + c x + d, then the resolvent cubic is generated by (y - (\u03b11 \u03b12 + \u03b13 \u03b14))(y - (\u03b11 \u03b13 + \u03b12 \u03b14))(y - (\u03b11 \u03b14 + \u03b12 \u03b13)). Let me compute that. But maybe it's easier to look up the formula for the resolvent cubic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that for the quartic x\u2074 +8x +14, the resolvent cubic can be computed, and then check if it's irreducible. If the resolvent cubic is irreducible, then the Galois group is S4 or A4. If it factors, then it's a different group. Wait, but since the original quartic is irreducible, the Galois group is transitive. Let me try to compute the resolvent cubic.\n\nThe general formula for the resolvent cubic of x\u2074 + px\u00b3 + qx\u00b2 + rx + s is x\u00b3 - qx\u00b2 + (pr -4s)x + (4qs -p\u00b2 s - r\u00b2). In our case, the quartic is x\u2074 +0x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +8x +14. So p=0, q=0, r=8, s=14. Plugging into the formula:\n\nResolvent cubic is x\u00b3 -0x\u00b2 + (0*8 -4*14)x + (4*0*14 -0\u00b2*14 -8\u00b2) = x\u00b3 + (-56)x + (-64). So resolvent cubic is x\u00b3 -56x -64.\n\nNow, check if this cubic is irreducible over \u211a. Let's apply the rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 64 over factors of 1: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b18, \u00b116, \u00b132, \u00b164. Testing x=4: 64 -56*4 -64 = 64 -224 -64 = -224 \u22600. x=2: 8 -112 -64 = -168 \u22600. x=1: 1 -56 -64 = -119 \u22600. x= -4: (-64) -56*(-4) -64 = -64 +224 -64=96\u22600. Similarly, x=8: 512 -56*8 -64=512 -448 -64=0. Wait, x=8: 8\u00b3 -56*8 -64 = 512 -448 -64=0. So x=8 is a root. Therefore, the resolvent cubic factors as (x -8)(x\u00b2 +8x +8). Let me check the quadratic factor: x\u00b2 +8x +8. Discriminant is 64 -32=32, which is not a square. So quadratic is irreducible. Therefore, the resolvent cubic factors as (x -8)(x\u00b2 +8x +8). So the resolvent cubic has one rational root and two irrational roots. Therefore, the Galois group of the resolvent cubic is of order 2 (since it's reducible with a linear and quadratic factor), so the Galois group is S3 if the quadratic splits further, but since the quadratic is irreducible, the Galois group is C2. Hmm, but maybe I should think about how this affects the original quartic's Galois group.\n\nThe fact that the resolvent cubic has a root in \u211a means that the Galois group of the quartic is a subgroup of D4 (the dihedral group of order 8) or C4. But I need to recall the exact relation. If the resolvent cubic has a rational root, then the Galois group of the quartic is a subgroup of D4. If the resolvent cubic is irreducible, then the Galois group is S4 or A4. But in our case, since the resolvent cubic factors into a linear and quadratic, the Galois group is a subgroup of D4. Since our original polynomial is irreducible, the Galois group must be transitive of degree 4. So possible groups are D4 (order 8), C4 (order 4), or V4 (order 4). Wait, but V4 is Klein four-group, but that is only transitive if it's acting as product of two transpositions. Wait, but for quartic polynomials, the transitive subgroups of S4 are: S4, A4, D4 (dihedral of order 8), C4 (cyclic of order 4), and V4 (Klein 4, which is transitive as it's generated by double transpositions). But for the Galois group to be V4, the polynomial must split into two quadratics over \u211a, but our polynomial is irreducible, so maybe not. Wait, but if the resolvent cubic has a rational root, then the Galois group is a subgroup of D4. Moreover, since the original polynomial is irreducible, the Galois group must have order divisible by 4. So possible orders: 4, 8.\n\nNow, if the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, then the Galois group is D4. If the resolvent cubic has all three roots rational, then it's V4. But here, the resolvent cubic has one rational root and two irrational roots. So according to some references, if the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, the Galois group is D4. Thus, the order is 8. Alternatively, let me check more carefully.\n\nIn the context of quartic polynomials, the resolvent cubic having a rational root implies that the Galois group is contained in D4. Then, to determine whether it is D4 or C4, we can check if the discriminant of the quartic is a square. The discriminant of the quartic x\u2074 + a x\u00b3 + b x\u00b2 + c x + d is given by 256 d\u00b3 - 192 a c d\u00b2 - 128 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 + ... Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, the discriminant of the quartic can also be related to the discriminant of its resolvent cubic. If the discriminant of the quartic is a square, then the Galois group is a subgroup of A4. But since our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group is D4 or C4. Alternatively, let's compute the discriminant of the quartic.\n\nAlternatively, since the resolvent cubic has Galois group of order 2 (since it factors into a linear and an irreducible quadratic), then the splitting field of the resolvent cubic is a quadratic extension. Then, the Galois group of the quartic is determined by how the roots relate. But this might be getting too abstract. Alternatively, according to some sources, if the quartic is irreducible, the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, and the discriminant of the quartic is not a square, then the Galois group is D4. If the discriminant is a square, then the Galois group is C4. \n\nSo let's compute the discriminant of the quartic. The discriminant D of the quartic x\u2074 +8x +14. There is a formula for the discriminant of a quartic which is D = 256d\u00b3 - 192a\u00b2d\u00b2 - 128b\u00b2d\u00b2 + ... wait, maybe it's easier to use the discriminant of the resolvent cubic. Wait, the discriminant of the quartic and the resolvent cubic are related. Specifically, the discriminant of the quartic is equal to the discriminant of the resolvent cubic. Wait, is that true? Let me check. For a quartic polynomial f with resolvent cubic g, the discriminant of f is equal to the discriminant of g. If that's the case, then compute the discriminant of the resolvent cubic g(x) = x\u00b3 -56x -64. The discriminant of a cubic x\u00b3 + ax + b is -4a\u00b3 -27b\u00b2. So here, a = -56, b = -64. Discriminant is -4*(-56)\u00b3 -27*(-64)\u00b2. Compute:\n\nFirst term: -4*(-56)^3 = -4*(-175616) = 702464.\n\nSecond term: -27*(-64)^2 = -27*(4096) = -110592.\n\nSum: 702464 -110592 = 591872. Is this a square? Let's see sqrt(591872) \u2248 769.4. Let me check 768\u00b2 = 589,824. 769\u00b2=591,361. 770\u00b2=592,900. So 591,872 is between 769\u00b2 and 770\u00b2. Not a perfect square. So discriminant D of the quartic is 591,872, which is not a square. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of A4 (since discriminant is not square), but since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, the Galois group is D4. Therefore, the order is 8.\n\nWait, but the resolvent cubic has discriminant 591,872, which is not a square, which implies that the Galois group of the resolvent cubic is S3, but since the resolvent cubic factors into a linear and quadratic, its Galois group is actually C2, right? Because the splitting field is Q(sqrt(32)) from the quadratic x\u00b2 +8x +8, which has discriminant 64 - 32 = 32. So sqrt(32) = 4*sqrt(2), so the splitting field of the resolvent cubic is Q(sqrt(2)). Therefore, the Galois group of the resolvent cubic is C2. This might complicate things. Wait, maybe the fact that the resolvent cubic splits into linear and quadratic with the quadratic having a non-square discriminant, then the Galois group of the resolvent cubic is order 2. Then, how does this affect the Galois group of the quartic?\n\nIn the classification, when the quartic is irreducible and the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, then the Galois group of the quartic is D4. But I need to confirm this. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the possible automorphisms. Since the quartic has no real roots, complex conjugation will swap the roots in pairs. So the Galois group contains a double transposition. Also, since the polynomial is irreducible, there's a 4-cycle in the Galois group. Wait, but if the Galois group is D4, which has order 8, it contains a 4-cycle and a transposition. But in our case, complex conjugation acts as a double transposition. So maybe D4 does contain such elements. Alternatively, maybe the Galois group is C4, but C4 doesn't contain a double transposition. Hmm. \n\nWait, the Galois group must contain a double transposition (from complex conjugation) and must be transitive. D4 contains elements of order 4 and double transpositions, so maybe that's the case. If the discriminant is not a square, then the group is not in A4, so S4 or D4. But the resolvent cubic having a rational root implies it's D4 or C4. If the discriminant is not a square, then D4. So putting it all together, the order of the Galois group is 8.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The polynomial \\(x^4 + 8x + 14\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) by Eisenstein's criterion with \\(p=2\\).

So, first, maybe I should check if the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a. Because if it factors, the Galois group might be smaller or have a different structure.\n\nLet me apply the Eisenstein's criterion. The polynomial is x\u2074 +8x +14. For Eisenstein, we need a prime number that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and the constant term isn't divisible by the square of that prime. Let's check primes. The constant term is 14, which factors into 2 and 7. Let's try p=2. Coefficients are 1 (x\u2074), 0 (x\u00b3), 0 (x\u00b2), 8 (x), 14. 2 divides 8 and 14, but the leading coefficient is 1, which 2 doesn't divide. Then, check if 2\u00b2 divides the constant term 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5, so no. So Eisenstein applies with p=2. Wait, but the coefficient of x is 8, which is divisible by 2, but the x\u2074 term's coefficient is 1, which isn't divisible by 2. So yes, Eisenstein works here. Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a. That means the Galois group is transitive, and the order is divisible by 4.\n\nSince the polynomial is quartic, the Galois group is a subgroup of S4. The possible orders for transitive subgroups of S4 are 4, 8, 12, 24. The groups are C4, V4, D4, A4, S4. Wait, but maybe I should check the discriminant to see if the group is a subgroup of A4. The discriminant of the polynomial can help determine if the Galois group is contained in A4 (if the discriminant is a square) or not.\n\nCalculating the discriminant of a quartic polynomial might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that if the polynomial is irreducible with exactly two real roots, then the Galois group contains a transposition, which combined with irreducibility (hence having a 4-cycle) would generate S4. But how do I check how many real roots this polynomial has?\n\nLet's consider f(x) = x\u2074 +8x +14. Compute its derivative: f\u2019(x) = 4x\u00b3 +8. Setting derivative to zero: 4x\u00b3 +8 =0 => x\u00b3 = -2 => x = -\u221b2 \u2248 -1.26. So the function has a critical point at x \u2248 -1.26. Let's evaluate f at this point. The real root of the derivative is x = -\u221b2. Plugging into f: (-\u221b2)^4 +8*(-\u221b2) +14. Let's compute each term:\n\n(-\u221b2)^4 = (\u221b2)^4 = (\u221b2)^3 * \u221b2 = 2 * \u221b2 \u2248 2.5198.\n\n8*(-\u221b2) \u2248 -8*1.26 \u2248 -10.08.\n\nSo total f(-\u221b2) \u2248 2.5198 -10.08 +14 \u2248 6.4398. So the function has a minimum at x=-\u221b2 of approximately 6.44, which is positive. Therefore, the function is always increasing except at the critical point where it has a local minimum. Since the minimum is positive, the function doesn't cross the x-axis here. Wait, but x\u2074 tends to infinity as x approaches \u00b1\u221e. So when x approaches +infty, x\u2074 dominates, so f(x) goes to +infty. When x approaches -infty, x\u2074 is positive and large, while 8x becomes very negative. Let's check f(-2): (-2)^4 +8*(-2) +14 = 16 -16 +14 =14. f(-3): 81 +8*(-3) +14=81-24+14=71. So for x negative, the function is positive. At x=0, f(0)=14. So all real roots? Wait, hold on. Wait, if the minimum value is positive, then the function never crosses the x-axis. So that would mean the polynomial has no real roots. But quartic with positive leading coefficient and tending to infinity on both ends, but with a positive minimum. So maybe it has no real roots? Wait, but x\u2074 +8x +14 at x approaching negative infinity: x\u2074 is positive, 8x is negative, but for very large negative x, x\u2074 dominates. So maybe f(-10^6) is a huge positive number. So the minimum at x=-\u221b2 is approximately 6.44, so the function is always above zero. Therefore, the polynomial has no real roots. So all roots are complex and come in conjugate pairs. So the splitting field has complex roots, which would require adjoining complex roots. So the Galois group must act on the four complex roots, which are two pairs of complex conjugates. \n\nSince the polynomial is irreducible over \u211a, the Galois group is transitive.

If there are two pairs of complex conjugate roots, say a, a', b, b', then the Galois group would have elements that permute these roots. The Galois group must have order divisible by 4 because it's irreducible. So possible groups could be the dihedral group D4 of order 8, or C4, or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe the Galois group is S4, but if all roots are complex, perhaps the Galois group is a dihedral group. Wait, but S4 has order 24. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute the resolvent cubic. For a quartic polynomial, the resolvent cubic can help determine the Galois group. Let me recall that for a quartic x\u2074 + a x\u00b3 + b x\u00b2 + c x + d, the resolvent cubic is x\u00b3 - b x\u00b2 + (ac -4d)x -a\u00b2 d +4b d -c\u00b2. Wait, but maybe I need to check the exact formula. Alternatively, for a quartic polynomial f(x) = x\u2074 + px\u00b3 + qx\u00b2 + rx + s, the resolvent cubic is x\u00b3 - qx\u00b2 + (pr -4s)x + (4qs -p\u00b2 s - r\u00b2). Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the resolvent cubic is derived from the roots. Let me see. If the quartic is x\u2074 + a x\u00b3 + b x\u00b2 + c x + d, then the resolvent cubic is generated by (y - (\u03b11 \u03b12 + \u03b13 \u03b14))(y - (\u03b11 \u03b13 + \u03b12 \u03b14))(y - (\u03b11 \u03b14 + \u03b12 \u03b13)). Let me compute that. But maybe it's easier to look up the formula for the resolvent cubic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that for the quartic x\u2074 +8x +14, the resolvent cubic can be computed, and then check if it's irreducible. If the resolvent cubic is irreducible, then the Galois group is S4 or A4. If it factors, then it's a different group. Wait, but since the original quartic is irreducible, the Galois group is transitive. Let me try to compute the resolvent cubic.\n\nThe general formula for the resolvent cubic of x\u2074 + px\u00b3 + qx\u00b2 + rx + s is x\u00b3 - qx\u00b2 + (pr -4s)x + (4qs -p\u00b2 s - r\u00b2). In our case, the quartic is x\u2074 +0x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +8x +14. So p=0, q=0, r=8, s=14. Plugging into the formula:\n\nResolvent cubic is x\u00b3 -0x\u00b2 + (0*8 -4*14)x + (4*0*14 -0\u00b2*14 -8\u00b2) = x\u00b3 + (-56)x + (-64). So resolvent cubic is x\u00b3 -56x -64.\n\nNow, check if this cubic is irreducible over \u211a. Let's apply the rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 64 over factors of 1: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b18, \u00b116, \u00b132, \u00b164. Testing x=4: 64 -56*4 -64 = 64 -224 -64 = -224 \u22600. x=2: 8 -112 -64 = -168 \u22600. x=1: 1 -56 -64 = -119 \u22600. x= -4: (-64) -56*(-4) -64 = -64 +224 -64=96\u22600. Similarly, x=8: 512 -56*8 -64=512 -448 -64=0. Wait, x=8: 8\u00b3 -56*8 -64 = 512 -448 -64=0. So x=8 is a root. Therefore, the resolvent cubic factors as (x -8)(x\u00b2 +8x +8). Let me check the quadratic factor: x\u00b2 +8x +8. Discriminant is 64 -32=32, which is not a square. So quadratic is irreducible. Therefore, the resolvent cubic factors as (x -8)(x\u00b2 +8x +8). So the resolvent cubic has one rational root and two irrational roots. Therefore, the Galois group of the resolvent cubic is of order 2 (since it's reducible with a linear and quadratic factor), so the Galois group is S3 if the quadratic splits further, but since the quadratic is irreducible, the Galois group is C2. Hmm, but maybe I should think about how this affects the original quartic's Galois group.\n\nThe fact that the resolvent cubic has a root in \u211a means that the Galois group of the quartic is a subgroup of D4 (the dihedral group of order 8) or C4. But I need to recall the exact relation. If the resolvent cubic has a rational root, then the Galois group of the quartic is a subgroup of D4. If the resolvent cubic is irreducible, then the Galois group is S4 or A4. But in our case, since the resolvent cubic factors into a linear and quadratic, the Galois group is a subgroup of D4. Since our original polynomial is irreducible, the Galois group must be transitive of degree 4. So possible groups are D4 (order 8), C4 (order 4), or V4 (order 4). Wait, but V4 is Klein four-group, but that is only transitive if it's acting as product of two transpositions. Wait, but for quartic polynomials, the transitive subgroups of S4 are: S4, A4, D4 (dihedral of order 8), C4 (cyclic of order 4), and V4 (Klein 4, which is transitive as it's generated by double transpositions). But for the Galois group to be V4, the polynomial must split into two quadratics over \u211a, but our polynomial is irreducible, so maybe not. Wait, but if the resolvent cubic has a rational root, then the Galois group is a subgroup of D4. Moreover, since the original polynomial is irreducible, the Galois group must have order divisible by 4. So possible orders: 4, 8.\n\nNow, if the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, then the Galois group is D4. If the resolvent cubic has all three roots rational, then it's V4. But here, the resolvent cubic has one rational root and two irrational roots. So according to some references, if the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, the Galois group is D4. Thus, the order is 8. Alternatively, let me check more carefully.\n\nIn the context of quartic polynomials, the resolvent cubic having a rational root implies that the Galois group is contained in D4. Then, to determine whether it is D4 or C4, we can check if the discriminant of the quartic is a square. The discriminant of the quartic x\u2074 + a x\u00b3 + b x\u00b2 + c x + d is given by 256 d\u00b3 - 192 a c d\u00b2 - 128 b\u00b2 d\u00b2 + ... Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, the discriminant of the quartic can also be related to the discriminant of its resolvent cubic. If the discriminant of the quartic is a square, then the Galois group is a subgroup of A4. But since our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group is D4 or C4. Alternatively, let's compute the discriminant of the quartic.\n\nAlternatively, since the resolvent cubic has Galois group of order 2 (since it factors into a linear and an irreducible quadratic), then the splitting field of the resolvent cubic is a quadratic extension. Then, the Galois group of the quartic is determined by how the roots relate. But this might be getting too abstract. Alternatively, according to some sources, if the quartic is irreducible, the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, and the discriminant of the quartic is not a square, then the Galois group is D4. If the discriminant is a square, then the Galois group is C4. \n\nSo let's compute the discriminant of the quartic. The discriminant D of the quartic x\u2074 +8x +14. There is a formula for the discriminant of a quartic which is D = 256d\u00b3 - 192a\u00b2d\u00b2 - 128b\u00b2d\u00b2 + ... wait, maybe it's easier to use the discriminant of the resolvent cubic. Wait, the discriminant of the quartic and the resolvent cubic are related. Specifically, the discriminant of the quartic is equal to the discriminant of the resolvent cubic. Wait, is that true? Let me check. For a quartic polynomial f with resolvent cubic g, the discriminant of f is equal to the discriminant of g. If that's the case, then compute the discriminant of the resolvent cubic g(x) = x\u00b3 -56x -64. The discriminant of a cubic x\u00b3 + ax + b is -4a\u00b3 -27b\u00b2. So here, a = -56, b = -64. Discriminant is -4*(-56)\u00b3 -27*(-64)\u00b2. Compute:\n\nFirst term: -4*(-56)^3 = -4*(-175616) = 702464.\n\nSecond term: -27*(-64)^2 = -27*(4096) = -110592.\n\nSum: 702464 -110592 = 591872. Is this a square? Let's see sqrt(591872) \u2248 769.4. Let me check 768\u00b2 = 589,824. 769\u00b2=591,361. 770\u00b2=592,900. So 591,872 is between 769\u00b2 and 770\u00b2. Not a perfect square. So discriminant D of the quartic is 591,872, which is not a square. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of A4 (since discriminant is not square), but since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, the Galois group is D4. Therefore, the order is 8.\n\nWait, but the resolvent cubic has discriminant 591,872, which is not a square, which implies that the Galois group of the resolvent cubic is S3, but since the resolvent cubic factors into a linear and quadratic, its Galois group is actually C2, right? Because the splitting field is Q(sqrt(32)) from the quadratic x\u00b2 +8x +8, which has discriminant 64 - 32 = 32. So sqrt(32) = 4*sqrt(2), so the splitting field of the resolvent cubic is Q(sqrt(2)). Therefore, the Galois group of the resolvent cubic is C2. This might complicate things. Wait, maybe the fact that the resolvent cubic splits into linear and quadratic with the quadratic having a non-square discriminant, then the Galois group of the resolvent cubic is order 2. Then, how does this affect the Galois group of the quartic?\n\nIn the classification, when the quartic is irreducible and the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, then the Galois group of the quartic is D4. But I need to confirm this. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the possible automorphisms. Since the quartic has no real roots, complex conjugation will swap the roots in pairs. So the Galois group contains a double transposition. Also, since the polynomial is irreducible, there's a 4-cycle in the Galois group. Wait, but if the Galois group is D4, which has order 8, it contains a 4-cycle and a transposition. But in our case, complex conjugation acts as a double transposition. So maybe D4 does contain such elements. Alternatively, maybe the Galois group is C4, but C4 doesn't contain a double transposition. Hmm. \n\nWait, the Galois group must contain a double transposition (from complex conjugation) and must be transitive. D4 contains elements of order 4 and double transpositions, so maybe that's the case. If the discriminant is not a square, then the group is not in A4, so S4 or D4. But the resolvent cubic having a rational root implies it's D4 or C4. If the discriminant is not a square, then D4. So putting it all together, the order of the Galois group is 8.",
