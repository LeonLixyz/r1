  "question": "Calculate the electrostatic energy of a charge \\( Q \\) distributed uniformly throughout a sphere of radius \\( R \\).\n",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the electrostatic energy of a charge Q uniformly distributed throughout a sphere of radius R. Hmm, right. Electrostatic energy, also known as the potential energy stored in the charge distribution. I remember that for a sphere, there are different formulas depending on whether the charge is on the surface or distributed throughout the volume. But here it's uniformly throughout the sphere, so it's a volume charge distribution.\n\nWait, how do you calculate the energy for that? I think the general formula for electrostatic energy is U = (1/2) \u03b5\u2080 \u222b E\u00b2 dV over all space. Or alternatively, using the potential, U = (1/2) \u222b \u03c1 \u03c6 dV, where \u03c1 is the charge density and \u03c6 is the electric potential. Since the charge is distributed in the sphere, maybe using the second formula would be easier here because I can integrate over the volume where \u03c1 is non-zero.\n\nFirst, let me recall the electric field inside and outside a uniformly charged sphere. Inside the sphere (r \u2264 R), the electric field E is given by E = (k Q r)/R\u00b3, right? Because for a uniformly charged sphere, the enclosed charge increases with r\u00b3, so E inside is proportional to r. Wait, k is 1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080), so maybe better to write E as (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * (Q r)/R\u00b3. And outside (r > R), it's like a point charge: E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * Q / r\u00b2.\n\nBut if I use the energy formula U = (\u03b5\u2080/2) \u222b E\u00b2 dV over all space, then I need to split the integral into two parts: from 0 to R (inside the sphere) and from R to infinity (outside). Since the charge is only inside, but the electric field exists both inside and outside. Let's try this approach.\n\nSo first, compute the integral inside the sphere. The electric field E1 inside (r \u2264 R) is (k Q r)/R\u00b3, where k = 1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080). So E1 = (Q r)/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080 R\u00b3). Then E1 squared is (Q\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6). The volume element dV in spherical coordinates is 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr. Wait, no, dV for a spherical shell is 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr. So integrating over r from 0 to R.\n\nSo the integral inside becomes (\u03b5\u2080/2) * \u222b (E1)\u00b2 * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R. Let's substitute E1 squared:\n\n= (\u03b5\u2080/2) * \u222b [(Q\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6)] * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe 4\u03c0 in the numerator cancels with the 16\u03c0\u00b2 in the denominator, leaving 1/(4\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2). So:\n\n= (\u03b5\u2080/2) * (Q\u00b2 / (16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6)) * 4\u03c0 \u222b r^4 dr from 0 to R\n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the constants:\n\n(\u03b5\u2080/2) * [ (Q\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6) ) ] * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr\n\n= (\u03b5\u2080 / 2) * (Q\u00b2 r\u00b2) / (16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6) ) * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n(\u03b5\u2080 / 2) * 4\u03c0 / (16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080^2) ) * Q\u00b2 r^4 / R^6 dr\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(4\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 ) / (32 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2) ) = (1) / (8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )\n\nSo the integral inside becomes (Q\u00b2 / R^6) * (1/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )) ) \u222b r^4 dr from 0 to R.\n\nCompute the integral of r^4 dr from 0 to R: [r^5 /5] from 0 to R is R^5/5.\n\nSo the inside part becomes (Q\u00b2 R^5) / (5 * 8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R^6) ) = Q\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nWait, simplifying further:\n\nInside integral part: (Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R^6)) * (R^5/5) ) = Q\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nThen, now the integral outside the sphere (r >= R). Here, the electric field E2 is (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * Q / r\u00b2. So E2 squared is (Q\u00b2)/(16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 r^4). The volume element is again 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr. So the integral for outside:\n\n(\u03b5\u2080 /2) * \u222b [Q\u00b2/(16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 r^4)] * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from R to infinity.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (\u03b5\u2080/2) * (Q\u00b2 *4\u03c0)/(16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2) ) \u222b dr / r\u00b2 from R to infinity.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n(4\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 ) / (32 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2) ) = 1/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )\n\nSo this becomes (Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )) \u222b (1/r\u00b2) dr from R to \u221e\n\nThe integral of 1/r\u00b2 dr from R to \u221e is [ -1/r ] from R to \u221e = 0 - (-1/R) = 1/R.\n\nSo the outside integral contributes (Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )) * (1/R )\n\nSo total energy U is the sum of inside and outside contributions:\n\nInside: Q\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nOutside: Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nSo adding them together: \n\nQ\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) + Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) = Q\u00b2/(\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) [ 1/40 + 1/8 ]\n\nConvert 1/8 to 5/40, so total 6/40 = 3/20\n\nSo U = (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait inside part: Q\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nOutside part: Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nLet me factor out Q\u00b2/(\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ):\n\n[1/40 + 1/8 ] = (1 +5)/40 = 6/40 = 3/20. Yes.\n\nSo total U = (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the standard formula I remember for the energy of a uniformly charged sphere is (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R), which is the same as (3/5) * (Q\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R * 2), but let me check units. Alternatively, considering that the answer might be written in terms of k instead of 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080). For example, k = 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080), so substituting:\n\nU = (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) = (3 Q\u00b2) * (4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080) / (20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) * k. Wait, perhaps better to express it in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, since k = 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080), then 1/(\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080) = 4 k. So:\n\nU = 3 Q\u00b2 * 4 k / (20 R) ) = (12 k Q\u00b2)/(20 R) ) = (3 k Q\u00b2)/(5 R )\n\nWhich is also written as (3/5) * (k Q\u00b2)/R. But the standard formula I think is (3/5) (Q\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R) * (1/2), wait no. Let's go back.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the two methods. Another approach is using the potential method. For a uniform charge distribution, the potential at a point inside the sphere is given by \u03c6(r) = (k Q)/(2 R) (3 - (r\u00b2/R\u00b2)). Wait, I need to confirm that.\n\nThe potential inside the sphere (r \u2264 R) is the sum of the potential due to charge inside r and outside r. Wait, the potential \u03c6(r) for a uniformly charged sphere is \u03c6(r) = (3kQ)/(2R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3R\u00b2)] for r \u2264 R. Wait, maybe I should rederive it.\n\nTo compute the potential inside the sphere, integrate the electric field from infinity to r. But wait, the electric field inside (r < R) is E = (k Q r)/R\u00b3, and outside is E = k Q / r\u00b2. So the potential at a point r inside is the integral from infinity to R of E_outside dr plus integral from R to r of E_inside dr.\n\nSo \u03c6(r) = \u222b_{\u221e}^R E_out dr + \u222b_R^r E_in dr\n\nE_out = k Q / r'^2, so integral from \u221e to R: \u222b E dr' = k Q [ -1/r' ] from \u221e to R = k Q (1/R - 0) = k Q/R.\n\nThen, integral from R to r of (k Q r')/R\u00b3 dr' = (k Q)/(R\u00b3) * \u222b from R to r r' dr' = (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3) [ r'^2 ] from R to r = (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2) \n\nSo total \u03c6(r) = k Q/R + (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2) = k Q/R + (k Q)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b3) \n\nSimplify:\n\n= k Q [ 1/R + (r\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b3) ) ]\n\n= k Q [ (2 R\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - R\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3) ) ]\n\n= k Q [ (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3) ) ]\n\n= (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3) (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2) \n\n= (k Q)/(2 R) [ 1 + (r\u00b2/R\u00b2) ]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's recompute:\n\nWait, the integral from R to r of E_in dr'. Let me recheck that. The integral of (k Q r')/R\u00b3 dr' from R to r would be (k Q)/(R\u00b3) * [ (r'^2)/2 ] from R to r.\n\nSo that's (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2). Then \u03c6(r) = k Q/R (from the outer integral) plus (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2). So simplifying:\n\n\u03c6(r) = k Q [ 1/R + (r\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b3) )\n\n= k Q [ (2 R\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - R\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3) ) ]\n\n= k Q [ (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3) ] \n\n= (k Q) (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3 )\n\n= (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3) (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2 )\n\n= (k Q)/(2 R) [1 + (r\u00b2)/(R\u00b2) ]\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm. Maybe my recollection was wrong. So the potential inside is \u03c6(r) = (k Q)/(2 R) [3 - (r\u00b2/R\u00b2)]? Wait, that doesn't match. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the integration signs. When computing the potential as the work done bringing a test charge from infinity to r, the electric field direction might affect the integral's sign. But since electric field is radially outward, and we're moving against it (from infinity to R), the first integral is positive. Then moving from R to r inside, the electric field is still in the direction of increasing r, so moving from R to a smaller r (r < R) would be against the field? Wait, no. If E inside is (k Q r)/R\u00b3, then in the region r < R, the field increases linearly with r, but direction is radial. So when you move from R to r (r < R), if r is less than R, you are moving inward. The electric field at each point is (k Q r')/R\u00b3 directed outward. So the integral from R to r (where r < R) is \u222b (E \u00b7 dl), where dl is dr' inward, so E \u00b7 dl = E dr' cos 180\u00b0 = - E dr'.\n\nWait, maybe that's where I made a mistake. Let's correct that. The potential is the integral from infinity to r of E \u00b7 dl, where dl is the path element. So for the region from infinity to R, moving against E_out (which is outward), so the integral is positive. Then from R to r (r < R), moving against E_in, which is outward, so again, the integral would be positive as we move inward against the field.\n\nBut when moving from R to r (r < R), the direction is inward, so the differential element dl is in the direction opposite to E (which is radial outward). Thus, E \u00b7 dl = E * dr' (since dr' is negative when moving inward). Wait, maybe integrating from R to r (with r < R) as part of the path gives a positive contribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute \u03c6(r) = \u222b (from infinity to r) E \u00b7 dr. \n\nSo from infinity to R, E = k Q / r'^2, dr is in the direction towards the center, so E and dr are in same direction (since E is outward, but moving inward, so dr is negative). Therefore, the integral would be \u222b (from infinity to R) (k Q / r'^2) dr', where dr is negative. Wait, to avoid confusion, it's better to compute the integral as:\n\n\u03c6(r) = \u222b_{\u221e}^r E \u00b7 dr\n\nBut for r < R, this splits into \u222b_{\u221e}^R E_out dr + \u222b_R^r E_in dr\n\nE_out = k Q / r'^2, so the first integral is \u222b_{\u221e}^R (k Q / r'^2) dr' = k Q [ -1/r' ]_{\u221e}^R = k Q ( -1/R + 0 ) = -k Q / R ? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, the actual integral should be positive. Wait, when moving from infinity to R, the displacement is in the direction opposite to the electric field (since E is radially outward, and you're moving inward). So the electric field and displacement direction are opposite, so E \u00b7 dl = - E dr. So the potential difference would be:\n\n\u0394\u03c6 = - \u222b E \u00b7 dl\n\nBut wait, the potential is defined as \u03c6(r) = - \u222b_{\u221e}^r E \u00b7 dl, where dl is the path element. So that would make \u03c6(r) = \u222b_{r}^\u221e E \u00b7 dl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me recall the proper definition.\n\nThe electric potential at a point is the work done per unit charge to bring a test charge from infinity to that point. So \u03c6(r) = - \u222b_{\u221e}^r E \u00b7 dl, where dl is the differential element along the path. So for the first part (from \u221e to R), since E is outward and the path is inward, the angle between E and dl is 180 degrees, so E \u00b7 dl = E * dl * cos(180) = -E dl. So the integral becomes:\n\n\u03c6(r) = - [ \u222b_{\u221e}^R E_out (-dl) + \u222b_R^r E_in (-dl) ]\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's easier to compute the integrals properly.\n\nLet me consider moving from infinity to R, then R to r (r < R). The electric field in the first part (r >= R) is E_out = k Q / r'^2, pointing outward. The displacement dl is from infinity towards R (direction is inward), so dl = - dr' (since r' decreases). So E \u00b7 dl = (k Q / r'^2)(-dr') because dl is in the negative r direction. So the integral from \u221e to R is:\n\n\u03c6_out = - \u222b_{\u221e}^R (k Q / r'^2) (-dr') ) = - \u222b_{\u221e}^R - (k Q / r'^2) dr' = \u222b_{\u221e}^R (k Q / r'^2) dr' = k Q [ -1/r' ]_{\u221e}^R = k Q ( -1/R - (-0) ) = - k Q / R ? No, that can't be. Wait, integrating from \u221e to R, which is the same as - \u222b_R^\u221e, but maybe I'm mixing the signs.\n\nAlternatively, using \u03c6(r) = \u222b_r^\u221e E dr for a positive charge (since potential decreases as you move against the field). Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for potential inside a uniformly charged sphere. For r \u2264 R, the potential is given by \u03c6(r) = (3kQ)/(2R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3R\u00b2)].\n\nAlternatively, I can look up that the potential energy of a uniformly charged sphere is (3/5) (Q\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080 R) * (1/2) or something like that. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula U = (1/2) \u222b \u03c1 \u03c6 dV. Since the charge is uniformly distributed, \u03c1 = 3Q/(4\u03c0 R\u00b3). The potential \u03c6(r) inside is (3kQ)/(2R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3R\u00b2)] ?\n\nWait, let me compute \u03c6(r) inside the sphere properly. The potential at a distance r inside the sphere is the sum of the potential due to the charge inside radius r and the charge outside r. But perhaps integrating the electric field is easier.\n\nEarlier, when I derived \u03c6(r) for r \u2264 R, I got \u03c6(r) = (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(R\u00b2 + r\u00b2). Wait, but that doesn't seem to align with standard expressions. Let me check again.\n\nElectric field inside (r \u2264 R) is E = (k Q r)/R\u00b3.\n\nThe potential \u03c6(r) is the integral from r to infinity of E \u00b7 dl. Wait, no, the potential is the work done against the field, so \u03c6(r) = - \u222b_{\u221e}^r E \u00b7 dl. \n\nBut when moving from infinity to R, E is k Q / r'^2 (like a point charge). The integral from \u221e to R is:\n\n- \u222b_{\u221e}^R (k Q / r'^2) dr' = - [ -k Q / r' ]_{\u221e}^R = - [ -k Q/R - 0 ] = k Q/R.\n\nThen, moving from R to r (r < R), the electric field is (k Q r')/R\u00b3. So the integral from R to r is:\n\n- \u222b_{R}^r (k Q r')/R\u00b3 dr' = - (k Q/R\u00b3) \u222b_{R}^r r' dr' = - (k Q/R\u00b3) [ (r'^2)/2 ] from R to r \n\n= - (k Q/(2 R\u00b3))( r\u00b2 - R\u00b2 )\n\n= - (k Q/(2 R\u00b3))(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2 )\n\nBut since r < R, r\u00b2 - R\u00b2 is negative, so this becomes positive.\n\nSo total \u03c6(r) = k Q/R + [k Q/(2 R\u00b3)](R\u00b2 - r\u00b2 )\n\n= k Q/R + (k Q (R\u00b2 - r\u00b2))/(2 R\u00b3 )\n\n= k Q/R [ 1 + (R\u00b2 - r\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b2) ]\n\n= k Q/R [ (2 R\u00b2 + R\u00b2 - r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b2) ) ]\n\n= k Q/R [ (3 R\u00b2 - r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b2) )\n\n= (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3) (3 R\u00b2 - r\u00b2 )\n\n= (3 k Q)/(2 R) - (k Q r\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b3 )\n\nWhich is the same as \u03c6(r) = (3 k Q)/(2 R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3 R\u00b2) ]\n\nAh, there we go. So \u03c6(r) inside is (3kQ)/(2R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3R\u00b2) ]\n\nNow, using the energy formula U = (1/2) \u222b \u03c1 \u03c6 dV, where \u03c1 is the charge density. Since it's uniform, \u03c1 = Q / ( (4/3) \u03c0 R\u00b3 ) ) = 3 Q/(4 \u03c0 R\u00b3).\n\nSo substituting into U:\n\nU = (1/2) * (3 Q/(4 \u03c0 R\u00b3)) * \u222b \u03c6(r) * 4 \u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/2) * (3 Q/(4 \u03c0 R\u00b3)) * 4 \u03c0 \u222b [ (3kQ)/(2 R) (1 - r\u00b2/(3 R\u00b2)) ] r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nThe 4\u03c0 cancels with the denominator's 4 \u03c0 R\u00b3, giving:\n\n= (1/2) * 3 Q / R\u00b3 * \u222b [ (3kQ)/(2 R) (1 - r\u00b2/(3 R\u00b2)) ] r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nMultiply constants:\n\n= (1/2) * (3 Q * 3 k Q ) / (2 R^4) ) * \u222b (1 - r\u00b2/(3 R\u00b2)) r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(9 k Q\u00b2) / (4 R^4 ) * \u222b (r\u00b2 - r^4/(3 R\u00b2)) dr from 0 to R\n\nCompute the integral:\n\n\u222b r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R = R\u00b3/3\n\n\u222b r^4 dr from 0 to R = R^5/5\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n(R\u00b3/3) - (1/(3 R\u00b2)) * (R^5/5) ) = (R\u00b3/3) - (R^3/15 ) = (5 R\u00b3/15 - R\u00b3/15 ) = (4 R\u00b3)/15\n\nSo the integral is (4 R\u00b3)/15\n\nPutting it back into U:\n\nU = (9 k Q\u00b2)/(4 R^4 ) * (4 R\u00b3/15 ) ) = (9 k Q\u00b2)/(4 R^4 ) * (4 R^3)/(15 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (9 k Q\u00b2 * 4 ) / (4 *15 R )\n\nThe 4s cancel, denominator 15 R, numerator 9 k Q\u00b2.\n\nSo U = (9 k Q\u00b2 ) / (15 R ) ) = (3 k Q\u00b2 ) / (5 R )\n\nSince k = 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 ), this becomes:\n\nU = (3 Q\u00b2 ) / (5 * 4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) ) = (3 Q\u00b2 )/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nWhich matches the earlier result from the first method. So the electrostatic energy is (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nAlternatively, since 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 ) is k, substituting back:\n\nU = (3 k Q\u00b2 )/(5 R )\n\nSo the answer is (3/5) * (k Q\u00b2)/R or (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nBut typically, the standard formula is written as (3/5) (Q\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ). Which would be 3 Q\u00b2/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ), yes. So that's the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 3 Q\u00b2/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ), or equivalently expressed with k, but the problem might expect the answer in terms of \u03b5\u2080 and \u03c0. So the answer is (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nAnother way to check: the energy stored in a capacitor is (1/2) Q V. But for a sphere, the capacitance is 4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R, but that's for a conducting sphere with charge on the surface. Here, the charge is distributed throughout the volume, so the energy is higher. For a conducting sphere, the energy is (1/2) Q^2/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ), which is (Q\u00b2)/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ). For the volume charge, it's 3/5 times higher, which gives (3/5) * (Q\u00b2)/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) ?? Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, for a conducting sphere (surface charge), the energy is U = (1/2) Q^2/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) = Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ). But here for a uniformly charged sphere, the energy is (3/5) times that. Wait, but according to our result, it's 3/(20) which is 0.15, whereas the surface is 1/8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R which is 0.125 Q\u00b2/(\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ). Wait, no, let me do the math:\n\nOur result for the volume charge is 3 Q\u00b2/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nFor the surface charge, the energy is Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nSo 3/20 vs 1/8. 1/8 is 0.125 and 3/20 is 0.15. So yes, volume charge stores more energy, which makes sense because the charges are closer together on average.\n\nSo the answer should be (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The electrostatic energy of a uniformly charged sphere can be calculated using the formula \\( U = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\rho \\phi \\, dV \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the charge density and \\( \\phi \\) is the electric potential.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the electrostatic energy of a charge Q uniformly distributed throughout a sphere of radius R. Hmm, right. Electrostatic energy, also known as the potential energy stored in the charge distribution. I remember that for a sphere, there are different formulas depending on whether the charge is on the surface or distributed throughout the volume. But here it's uniformly throughout the sphere, so it's a volume charge distribution.\n\nWait, how do you calculate the energy for that? I think the general formula for electrostatic energy is U = (1/2) \u03b5\u2080 \u222b E\u00b2 dV over all space. Or alternatively, using the potential, U = (1/2) \u222b \u03c1 \u03c6 dV, where \u03c1 is the charge density and \u03c6 is the electric potential. Since the charge is distributed in the sphere, maybe using the second formula would be easier here because I can integrate over the volume where \u03c1 is non-zero.\n\nFirst, let me recall the electric field inside and outside a uniformly charged sphere. Inside the sphere (r \u2264 R), the electric field E is given by E = (k Q r)/R\u00b3, right? Because for a uniformly charged sphere, the enclosed charge increases with r\u00b3, so E inside is proportional to r. Wait, k is 1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080), so maybe better to write E as (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * (Q r)/R\u00b3. And outside (r > R), it's like a point charge: E = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * Q / r\u00b2.\n\nBut if I use the energy formula U = (\u03b5\u2080/2) \u222b E\u00b2 dV over all space, then I need to split the integral into two parts: from 0 to R (inside the sphere) and from R to infinity (outside). Since the charge is only inside, but the electric field exists both inside and outside. Let's try this approach.\n\nSo first, compute the integral inside the sphere. The electric field E1 inside (r \u2264 R) is (k Q r)/R\u00b3, where k = 1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080). So E1 = (Q r)/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080 R\u00b3). Then E1 squared is (Q\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6). The volume element dV in spherical coordinates is 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr. Wait, no, dV for a spherical shell is 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr. So integrating over r from 0 to R.\n\nSo the integral inside becomes (\u03b5\u2080/2) * \u222b (E1)\u00b2 * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R. Let's substitute E1 squared:\n\n= (\u03b5\u2080/2) * \u222b [(Q\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6)] * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe 4\u03c0 in the numerator cancels with the 16\u03c0\u00b2 in the denominator, leaving 1/(4\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2). So:\n\n= (\u03b5\u2080/2) * (Q\u00b2 / (16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6)) * 4\u03c0 \u222b r^4 dr from 0 to R\n\nWait, let's do it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the constants:\n\n(\u03b5\u2080/2) * [ (Q\u00b2 r\u00b2)/(16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6) ) ] * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr\n\n= (\u03b5\u2080 / 2) * (Q\u00b2 r\u00b2) / (16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 R^6) ) * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n(\u03b5\u2080 / 2) * 4\u03c0 / (16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080^2) ) * Q\u00b2 r^4 / R^6 dr\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(4\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 ) / (32 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2) ) = (1) / (8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )\n\nSo the integral inside becomes (Q\u00b2 / R^6) * (1/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )) ) \u222b r^4 dr from 0 to R.\n\nCompute the integral of r^4 dr from 0 to R: [r^5 /5] from 0 to R is R^5/5.\n\nSo the inside part becomes (Q\u00b2 R^5) / (5 * 8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R^6) ) = Q\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nWait, simplifying further:\n\nInside integral part: (Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R^6)) * (R^5/5) ) = Q\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nThen, now the integral outside the sphere (r >= R). Here, the electric field E2 is (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080)) * Q / r\u00b2. So E2 squared is (Q\u00b2)/(16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 r^4). The volume element is again 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr. So the integral for outside:\n\n(\u03b5\u2080 /2) * \u222b [Q\u00b2/(16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2 r^4)] * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from R to infinity.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (\u03b5\u2080/2) * (Q\u00b2 *4\u03c0)/(16 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2) ) \u222b dr / r\u00b2 from R to infinity.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n(4\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 ) / (32 \u03c0\u00b2 \u03b5\u2080\u00b2) ) = 1/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )\n\nSo this becomes (Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )) \u222b (1/r\u00b2) dr from R to \u221e\n\nThe integral of 1/r\u00b2 dr from R to \u221e is [ -1/r ] from R to \u221e = 0 - (-1/R) = 1/R.\n\nSo the outside integral contributes (Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 )) * (1/R )\n\nSo total energy U is the sum of inside and outside contributions:\n\nInside: Q\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nOutside: Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nSo adding them together: \n\nQ\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) + Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) = Q\u00b2/(\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) [ 1/40 + 1/8 ]\n\nConvert 1/8 to 5/40, so total 6/40 = 3/20\n\nSo U = (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait inside part: Q\u00b2/(40 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nOutside part: Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nLet me factor out Q\u00b2/(\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ):\n\n[1/40 + 1/8 ] = (1 +5)/40 = 6/40 = 3/20. Yes.\n\nSo total U = (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the standard formula I remember for the energy of a uniformly charged sphere is (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R), which is the same as (3/5) * (Q\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R * 2), but let me check units. Alternatively, considering that the answer might be written in terms of k instead of 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080). For example, k = 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080), so substituting:\n\nU = (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) = (3 Q\u00b2) * (4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080) / (20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) * k. Wait, perhaps better to express it in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, since k = 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080), then 1/(\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080) = 4 k. So:\n\nU = 3 Q\u00b2 * 4 k / (20 R) ) = (12 k Q\u00b2)/(20 R) ) = (3 k Q\u00b2)/(5 R )\n\nWhich is also written as (3/5) * (k Q\u00b2)/R. But the standard formula I think is (3/5) (Q\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R) * (1/2), wait no. Let's go back.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the two methods. Another approach is using the potential method. For a uniform charge distribution, the potential at a point inside the sphere is given by \u03c6(r) = (k Q)/(2 R) (3 - (r\u00b2/R\u00b2)). Wait, I need to confirm that.\n\nThe potential inside the sphere (r \u2264 R) is the sum of the potential due to charge inside r and outside r. Wait, the potential \u03c6(r) for a uniformly charged sphere is \u03c6(r) = (3kQ)/(2R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3R\u00b2)] for r \u2264 R. Wait, maybe I should rederive it.\n\nTo compute the potential inside the sphere, integrate the electric field from infinity to r. But wait, the electric field inside (r < R) is E = (k Q r)/R\u00b3, and outside is E = k Q / r\u00b2. So the potential at a point r inside is the integral from infinity to R of E_outside dr plus integral from R to r of E_inside dr.\n\nSo \u03c6(r) = \u222b_{\u221e}^R E_out dr + \u222b_R^r E_in dr\n\nE_out = k Q / r'^2, so integral from \u221e to R: \u222b E dr' = k Q [ -1/r' ] from \u221e to R = k Q (1/R - 0) = k Q/R.\n\nThen, integral from R to r of (k Q r')/R\u00b3 dr' = (k Q)/(R\u00b3) * \u222b from R to r r' dr' = (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3) [ r'^2 ] from R to r = (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2) \n\nSo total \u03c6(r) = k Q/R + (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2) = k Q/R + (k Q)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b3) \n\nSimplify:\n\n= k Q [ 1/R + (r\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b3) ) ]\n\n= k Q [ (2 R\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - R\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3) ) ]\n\n= k Q [ (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3) ) ]\n\n= (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3) (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2) \n\n= (k Q)/(2 R) [ 1 + (r\u00b2/R\u00b2) ]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's recompute:\n\nWait, the integral from R to r of E_in dr'. Let me recheck that. The integral of (k Q r')/R\u00b3 dr' from R to r would be (k Q)/(R\u00b3) * [ (r'^2)/2 ] from R to r.\n\nSo that's (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2). Then \u03c6(r) = k Q/R (from the outer integral) plus (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2). So simplifying:\n\n\u03c6(r) = k Q [ 1/R + (r\u00b2 - R\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b3) )\n\n= k Q [ (2 R\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - R\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3) ) ]\n\n= k Q [ (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3) ] \n\n= (k Q) (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b3 )\n\n= (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3) (R\u00b2 + r\u00b2 )\n\n= (k Q)/(2 R) [1 + (r\u00b2)/(R\u00b2) ]\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm. Maybe my recollection was wrong. So the potential inside is \u03c6(r) = (k Q)/(2 R) [3 - (r\u00b2/R\u00b2)]? Wait, that doesn't match. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the integration signs. When computing the potential as the work done bringing a test charge from infinity to r, the electric field direction might affect the integral's sign. But since electric field is radially outward, and we're moving against it (from infinity to R), the first integral is positive. Then moving from R to r inside, the electric field is still in the direction of increasing r, so moving from R to a smaller r (r < R) would be against the field? Wait, no. If E inside is (k Q r)/R\u00b3, then in the region r < R, the field increases linearly with r, but direction is radial. So when you move from R to r (r < R), if r is less than R, you are moving inward. The electric field at each point is (k Q r')/R\u00b3 directed outward. So the integral from R to r (where r < R) is \u222b (E \u00b7 dl), where dl is dr' inward, so E \u00b7 dl = E dr' cos 180\u00b0 = - E dr'.\n\nWait, maybe that's where I made a mistake. Let's correct that. The potential is the integral from infinity to r of E \u00b7 dl, where dl is the path element. So for the region from infinity to R, moving against E_out (which is outward), so the integral is positive. Then from R to r (r < R), moving against E_in, which is outward, so again, the integral would be positive as we move inward against the field.\n\nBut when moving from R to r (r < R), the direction is inward, so the differential element dl is in the direction opposite to E (which is radial outward). Thus, E \u00b7 dl = E * dr' (since dr' is negative when moving inward). Wait, maybe integrating from R to r (with r < R) as part of the path gives a positive contribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute \u03c6(r) = \u222b (from infinity to r) E \u00b7 dr. \n\nSo from infinity to R, E = k Q / r'^2, dr is in the direction towards the center, so E and dr are in same direction (since E is outward, but moving inward, so dr is negative). Therefore, the integral would be \u222b (from infinity to R) (k Q / r'^2) dr', where dr is negative. Wait, to avoid confusion, it's better to compute the integral as:\n\n\u03c6(r) = \u222b_{\u221e}^r E \u00b7 dr\n\nBut for r < R, this splits into \u222b_{\u221e}^R E_out dr + \u222b_R^r E_in dr\n\nE_out = k Q / r'^2, so the first integral is \u222b_{\u221e}^R (k Q / r'^2) dr' = k Q [ -1/r' ]_{\u221e}^R = k Q ( -1/R + 0 ) = -k Q / R ? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, the actual integral should be positive. Wait, when moving from infinity to R, the displacement is in the direction opposite to the electric field (since E is radially outward, and you're moving inward). So the electric field and displacement direction are opposite, so E \u00b7 dl = - E dr. So the potential difference would be:\n\n\u0394\u03c6 = - \u222b E \u00b7 dl\n\nBut wait, the potential is defined as \u03c6(r) = - \u222b_{\u221e}^r E \u00b7 dl, where dl is the path element. So that would make \u03c6(r) = \u222b_{r}^\u221e E \u00b7 dl. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me recall the proper definition.\n\nThe electric potential at a point is the work done per unit charge to bring a test charge from infinity to that point. So \u03c6(r) = - \u222b_{\u221e}^r E \u00b7 dl, where dl is the differential element along the path. So for the first part (from \u221e to R), since E is outward and the path is inward, the angle between E and dl is 180 degrees, so E \u00b7 dl = E * dl * cos(180) = -E dl. So the integral becomes:\n\n\u03c6(r) = - [ \u222b_{\u221e}^R E_out (-dl) + \u222b_R^r E_in (-dl) ]\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's easier to compute the integrals properly.\n\nLet me consider moving from infinity to R, then R to r (r < R). The electric field in the first part (r >= R) is E_out = k Q / r'^2, pointing outward. The displacement dl is from infinity towards R (direction is inward), so dl = - dr' (since r' decreases). So E \u00b7 dl = (k Q / r'^2)(-dr') because dl is in the negative r direction. So the integral from \u221e to R is:\n\n\u03c6_out = - \u222b_{\u221e}^R (k Q / r'^2) (-dr') ) = - \u222b_{\u221e}^R - (k Q / r'^2) dr' = \u222b_{\u221e}^R (k Q / r'^2) dr' = k Q [ -1/r' ]_{\u221e}^R = k Q ( -1/R - (-0) ) = - k Q / R ? No, that can't be. Wait, integrating from \u221e to R, which is the same as - \u222b_R^\u221e, but maybe I'm mixing the signs.\n\nAlternatively, using \u03c6(r) = \u222b_r^\u221e E dr for a positive charge (since potential decreases as you move against the field). Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for potential inside a uniformly charged sphere. For r \u2264 R, the potential is given by \u03c6(r) = (3kQ)/(2R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3R\u00b2)].\n\nAlternatively, I can look up that the potential energy of a uniformly charged sphere is (3/5) (Q\u00b2)/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080 R) * (1/2) or something like that. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula U = (1/2) \u222b \u03c1 \u03c6 dV. Since the charge is uniformly distributed, \u03c1 = 3Q/(4\u03c0 R\u00b3). The potential \u03c6(r) inside is (3kQ)/(2R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3R\u00b2)] ?\n\nWait, let me compute \u03c6(r) inside the sphere properly. The potential at a distance r inside the sphere is the sum of the potential due to the charge inside radius r and the charge outside r. But perhaps integrating the electric field is easier.\n\nEarlier, when I derived \u03c6(r) for r \u2264 R, I got \u03c6(r) = (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3)(R\u00b2 + r\u00b2). Wait, but that doesn't seem to align with standard expressions. Let me check again.\n\nElectric field inside (r \u2264 R) is E = (k Q r)/R\u00b3.\n\nThe potential \u03c6(r) is the integral from r to infinity of E \u00b7 dl. Wait, no, the potential is the work done against the field, so \u03c6(r) = - \u222b_{\u221e}^r E \u00b7 dl. \n\nBut when moving from infinity to R, E is k Q / r'^2 (like a point charge). The integral from \u221e to R is:\n\n- \u222b_{\u221e}^R (k Q / r'^2) dr' = - [ -k Q / r' ]_{\u221e}^R = - [ -k Q/R - 0 ] = k Q/R.\n\nThen, moving from R to r (r < R), the electric field is (k Q r')/R\u00b3. So the integral from R to r is:\n\n- \u222b_{R}^r (k Q r')/R\u00b3 dr' = - (k Q/R\u00b3) \u222b_{R}^r r' dr' = - (k Q/R\u00b3) [ (r'^2)/2 ] from R to r \n\n= - (k Q/(2 R\u00b3))( r\u00b2 - R\u00b2 )\n\n= - (k Q/(2 R\u00b3))(r\u00b2 - R\u00b2 )\n\nBut since r < R, r\u00b2 - R\u00b2 is negative, so this becomes positive.\n\nSo total \u03c6(r) = k Q/R + [k Q/(2 R\u00b3)](R\u00b2 - r\u00b2 )\n\n= k Q/R + (k Q (R\u00b2 - r\u00b2))/(2 R\u00b3 )\n\n= k Q/R [ 1 + (R\u00b2 - r\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b2) ]\n\n= k Q/R [ (2 R\u00b2 + R\u00b2 - r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b2) ) ]\n\n= k Q/R [ (3 R\u00b2 - r\u00b2) / (2 R\u00b2) )\n\n= (k Q)/(2 R\u00b3) (3 R\u00b2 - r\u00b2 )\n\n= (3 k Q)/(2 R) - (k Q r\u00b2)/(2 R\u00b3 )\n\nWhich is the same as \u03c6(r) = (3 k Q)/(2 R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3 R\u00b2) ]\n\nAh, there we go. So \u03c6(r) inside is (3kQ)/(2R) [1 - (r\u00b2)/(3R\u00b2) ]\n\nNow, using the energy formula U = (1/2) \u222b \u03c1 \u03c6 dV, where \u03c1 is the charge density. Since it's uniform, \u03c1 = Q / ( (4/3) \u03c0 R\u00b3 ) ) = 3 Q/(4 \u03c0 R\u00b3).\n\nSo substituting into U:\n\nU = (1/2) * (3 Q/(4 \u03c0 R\u00b3)) * \u222b \u03c6(r) * 4 \u03c0 r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/2) * (3 Q/(4 \u03c0 R\u00b3)) * 4 \u03c0 \u222b [ (3kQ)/(2 R) (1 - r\u00b2/(3 R\u00b2)) ] r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nThe 4\u03c0 cancels with the denominator's 4 \u03c0 R\u00b3, giving:\n\n= (1/2) * 3 Q / R\u00b3 * \u222b [ (3kQ)/(2 R) (1 - r\u00b2/(3 R\u00b2)) ] r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nMultiply constants:\n\n= (1/2) * (3 Q * 3 k Q ) / (2 R^4) ) * \u222b (1 - r\u00b2/(3 R\u00b2)) r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(9 k Q\u00b2) / (4 R^4 ) * \u222b (r\u00b2 - r^4/(3 R\u00b2)) dr from 0 to R\n\nCompute the integral:\n\n\u222b r\u00b2 dr from 0 to R = R\u00b3/3\n\n\u222b r^4 dr from 0 to R = R^5/5\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n(R\u00b3/3) - (1/(3 R\u00b2)) * (R^5/5) ) = (R\u00b3/3) - (R^3/15 ) = (5 R\u00b3/15 - R\u00b3/15 ) = (4 R\u00b3)/15\n\nSo the integral is (4 R\u00b3)/15\n\nPutting it back into U:\n\nU = (9 k Q\u00b2)/(4 R^4 ) * (4 R\u00b3/15 ) ) = (9 k Q\u00b2)/(4 R^4 ) * (4 R^3)/(15 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (9 k Q\u00b2 * 4 ) / (4 *15 R )\n\nThe 4s cancel, denominator 15 R, numerator 9 k Q\u00b2.\n\nSo U = (9 k Q\u00b2 ) / (15 R ) ) = (3 k Q\u00b2 ) / (5 R )\n\nSince k = 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 ), this becomes:\n\nU = (3 Q\u00b2 ) / (5 * 4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) ) = (3 Q\u00b2 )/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nWhich matches the earlier result from the first method. So the electrostatic energy is (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nAlternatively, since 1/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 ) is k, substituting back:\n\nU = (3 k Q\u00b2 )/(5 R )\n\nSo the answer is (3/5) * (k Q\u00b2)/R or (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nBut typically, the standard formula is written as (3/5) (Q\u00b2)/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ). Which would be 3 Q\u00b2/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ), yes. So that's the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 3 Q\u00b2/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ), or equivalently expressed with k, but the problem might expect the answer in terms of \u03b5\u2080 and \u03c0. So the answer is (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nAnother way to check: the energy stored in a capacitor is (1/2) Q V. But for a sphere, the capacitance is 4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R, but that's for a conducting sphere with charge on the surface. Here, the charge is distributed throughout the volume, so the energy is higher. For a conducting sphere, the energy is (1/2) Q^2/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ), which is (Q\u00b2)/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ). For the volume charge, it's 3/5 times higher, which gives (3/5) * (Q\u00b2)/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) ?? Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, for a conducting sphere (surface charge), the energy is U = (1/2) Q^2/(4 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ) = Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ). But here for a uniformly charged sphere, the energy is (3/5) times that. Wait, but according to our result, it's 3/(20) which is 0.15, whereas the surface is 1/8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R which is 0.125 Q\u00b2/(\u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R ). Wait, no, let me do the math:\n\nOur result for the volume charge is 3 Q\u00b2/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nFor the surface charge, the energy is Q\u00b2/(8 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )\n\nSo 3/20 vs 1/8. 1/8 is 0.125 and 3/20 is 0.15. So yes, volume charge stores more energy, which makes sense because the charges are closer together on average.\n\nSo the answer should be (3 Q\u00b2)/(20 \u03c0 \u03b5\u2080 R )",
