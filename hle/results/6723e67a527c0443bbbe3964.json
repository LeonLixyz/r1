  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this differential equation problem. The given equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). The standard form for such equations is x'(t) + P(t)x(t) = Q(t). Here, comparing, I can see that P(t) is t h(t) \u2014 wait, wait, the equation is written as \"th~t x3(t)\". Hmm, maybe that's a typo or misinterpretation. Let me check again. The original equation is x3'(t) + t h~t x3(t) = e^(-t/3). Oh, wait, perhaps the \"h~t\" is actually meant to be hyperbolic tangent, which is tanh(t). Because \"tanh\" is sometimes written with a tilde or similar symbols. So maybe the equation is x3'(t) + t * tanh(t) * x3(t) = e^(-t/3). That makes more sense. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo the ODE is x' + t tanh(t) x = e^(-t/3), with the initial condition x(0) = 5. To solve this, I need to find an integrating factor. The integrating factor \u03bc(t) is exp(\u222b P(t) dt), where P(t) is the coefficient of x(t), which here is t tanh(t). So first, compute the integral of t tanh(t) dt. Hmm, integrating t tanh(t)... Let's see. Integration by parts maybe. Let me set u = t, dv = tanh(t) dt. Then du = dt, and v = \u222b tanh(t) dt = ln(cosh(t)) because the integral of tanh(t) is ln(cosh(t)) + C. So integrating by parts, \u222b t tanh(t) dt = t ln(cosh(t)) - \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt. Wait, but the remaining integral \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way or perhaps the integral simplifies under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows for the integrating factor to be expressed in terms of the integral without evaluating it completely. Wait, but maybe there's a different approach here. Let me check if I made a mistake in identifying P(t). Let me confirm again the original equation: x3'(t) + t h~t x3(t) = e^{-t/3}. If \"h~t\" is something else, like hyperbolic cotangent or another function, but \"tanh\" is likely. Alternatively, the notation might be a typo for \"t h(t)\", but that's unclear. But assuming that it's t * tanh(t), then proceeding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x3'(t) + t * h(t) * x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, where h(t) is a given function. But since h(t) isn't defined here, that would be a problem. Wait, the original problem statement doesn't mention any other functions, so \"h~t\" must be a notation for a standard function. So, I think \"tanh(t)\" is the most plausible interpretation here.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed. The integrating factor \u03bc(t) is exp(\u222b t tanh(t) dt). But integrating t tanh(t) is a bit tricky. Let me think again. Let's try expanding tanh(t). Remember that tanh(t) = (e^t - e^{-t})/(e^t + e^{-t}). Maybe substitution? Let u = t, dv = tanh(t) dt. Wait, but as before, integration by parts. Let's proceed:\n\n\u222b t tanh(t) dt = t ln(cosh(t)) - \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt.\n\nHmm, this leaves us with \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt. I'm not sure if this integral has a closed-form expression. Maybe there's another approach. Wait, perhaps instead of computing the integrating factor directly, there's a simplifying substitution. Alternatively, maybe this ODE can be solved using another method. Wait, but for linear first-order ODEs, the integrating factor method is the standard approach. Let me check if there's an alternative way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral \u222b t tanh(t) dt can be expressed in terms of known functions. Let me look up or recall if there's an antiderivative for t tanh(t). Alternatively, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the integral simplifies when evaluated from 0 to t. Let me consider definite integrals. Suppose I compute the integral from 0 to t. So, integrating factor \u03bc(t) is exp(\u222b_{0}^{t} s tanh(s) ds). Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my approach. Let me verify the steps again. The standard solution formula for a linear ODE x' + P(t)x = Q(t) is x(t) = [\u222b \u03bc(s) Q(s) ds + C] / \u03bc(t), where \u03bc(t) = exp(\u222b P(s) ds). So here, P(t) is t tanh(t), which we need to integrate. Let me compute \u222b t tanh(t) dt again. Let's try substitution. Let u = t^2 / 2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Alternatively, series expansion? For small t, tanh(t) \u2248 t - t^3/3 + 2t^5/15 - ..., but integrating term by term might not help here. Alternatively, maybe integrating t tanh(t) can be expressed using the dilogarithm function or something similar. Wait, perhaps not. Let's try integrating by parts again.\n\nLet me set u = t, dv = tanh(t) dt. Then du = dt, v = ln(cosh(t)). So \u222b t tanh(t) dt = t ln(cosh(t)) - \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt. Now, the remaining integral \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt. I know that \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt can be expressed as (t^2)/2 - (t log(1 + e^{-2t}))/2 - (Li_2(-e^{-2t}))/4 + C, where Li_2 is the dilogarithm function. But this seems complicated and not helpful for the problem at hand. Wait, but maybe in the context of this problem, the integral cancels out or combines in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the integrating factor simplifies when considering the specific form of Q(t) = e^{-t/3}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the original ODE. Let me check once again. The original equation is x3'(t) + t h~t x3(t) = e^{-t/3}. If \"h~t\" is not tanh(t), but maybe something else. For example, if it's a typo for \"t^2\", but that would be written differently. Alternatively, could it be \"ht\" as in a function h(t)? But since h is undefined, that would be an issue. Alternatively, perhaps the tilde is a separator, and the equation is x3' + t h(t) x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, but then h(t) is undefined. That can't be. Therefore, I think the most plausible interpretation is that \"h~t\" is a typo or notation for tanh(t), as originally thought.\n\nGiven that, maybe even though the integral of t tanh(t) is complicated, the problem might have a clever way to proceed. Let's proceed step by step. Let me denote \u03bc(t) = exp(\u222b t tanh(t) dt). Let's compute that integral from 0 to t, since we have an initial condition at t=0. Let me compute the integrating factor:\n\n\u03bc(t) = exp( \u222b_{0}^{t} s tanh(s) ds )\n\nBut how to compute that? Alternatively, perhaps the product t tanh(t) can be rewritten. Wait, note that d/dt (ln cosh(t)) = tanh(t). So \u222b tanh(t) dt = ln cosh(t) + C. But here we have \u222b s tanh(s) ds. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution u = cosh(s), but I don't think that helps here. Let me try integrating by parts again. Let u = s, dv = tanh(s) ds. Then du = ds, v = ln cosh(s). So:\n\n\u222b s tanh(s) ds = s ln cosh(s) - \u222b ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nNow, the integral \u222b ln cosh(s) ds. Let me recall that \u222b ln cosh(s) ds = (s^2)/2 - (s ln(1 + e^{-2s}))/2 - (1/4) Li_2(-e^{-2s}) ) + C. But again, this seems too complex. Perhaps the problem is designed such that when we proceed through the integrating factor, the terms involving Li_2 or others will cancel out. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in approach here. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x3' + t * h(t) x3 = e^{-t/3}, with h(t) being some function that makes the integrating factor manageable. But since h(t) isn't given, that's not possible. So perhaps my initial assumption about \"h~t\" being tanh(t) is incorrect. Let me try re-examining the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: x3'(t) + th~t x3(t) = e^{-t/3}\n\nMaybe \"th~t\" is a typo for \"t^2\", but that's written as t squared. Alternatively, maybe \"t h(t)\" where h(t) is a function. But no h(t) is provided. Alternatively, maybe \"th~t\" is actually \"t times the Heaviside step function at t\", but that would be unusual notation. Alternatively, perhaps \"h~t\" is a misformatting of \"h(t)\", but again, h(t) is undefined. This is getting confusing. Maybe the problem has a typo. But since we have to work with what's given, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps \"th~t\" is a misinterpreted way of writing \"tanh(t)\". In some contexts, especially in handwriting, \"tanht\" could be written with a tilde over the h, but that's speculative. Assuming that, let's proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"h~t\" is a typo for \"h(t)\", but then since h is undefined, maybe the problem is missing information. But since it's given as part of the problem, perhaps we're supposed to interpret it as a known function. Alternatively, maybe it's a formatting error. For example, maybe the original equation was supposed to be written with a multiplication symbol, like t * h(t), but due to formatting, it became \"th~t\". But without additional context, this is challenging.\n\nAlternatively, could \"h~t\" be a misplaced symbol? For instance, if the equation was supposed to be x3'(t) + t * h(t) x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, but h(t) is defined elsewhere. But since it's not, this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the equation is x3' + t * tanh(t) x3 = e^{-t/3}, as initially thought, and proceed with solving it, even if the integral seems complex. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different function. For instance, if \"h~t\" is intended to represent the hyperbolic cotangent (coth(t)), but that's written as coth(t).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x3'(t) + t * h(t) x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, and \"h~t\" is a miswritten h(t) = something. But without knowing h(t), this seems impossible. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo and \"th~t\" is supposed to be \"t ht\", and \"ht\" is another variable. But that also seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, let's think if the equation can be written in another way. Perhaps if the equation is x3'(t) + t h(t) x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, and h(t) is given by h(t) = ~t, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the tilde is a formatting error, and the equation is x3' + t h(t) x3 = e^{-t/3}, with h(t) = t. But then that would make the coefficient t^2, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's t multiplied by the function h(t) which is some standard function, like the Heaviside function, but again, that's unclear. Given the lack of clarity here, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that \"th~t\" is intended to be t times tanh(t), as that's a common function and the notation might be a formatting error.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed. So integrating factor \u03bc(t) is exp(\u222b t tanh(t) dt). Let me compute this integral from 0 to t. Let's denote I(t) = \u222b_{0}^{t} s tanh(s) ds. As before, integrating by parts:\n\nLet u = s, dv = tanh(s) ds, then du = ds, v = ln(cosh(s)).\n\nSo, I(t) = s ln cosh(s) evaluated from 0 to t minus \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nSo I(t) = t ln cosh(t) - \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nBut \u222b ln cosh(s) ds from 0 to t can be expressed as (t^2)/2 - (t ln 2)/2 + (1/4) Li_2(-e^{-2t}) ) - (1/4) Li_2(-1) ). Wait, this seems too complicated. Let me recall that \u222b ln cosh(s) ds from 0 to t is (t^2)/2 - (t ln 2) + (1/2) \u222b_{0}^{t} s e^{-2s} ds + ... Hmm, perhaps there's a series expansion. Alternatively, for large t, ln cosh(t) \u2248 t - ln 2, so \u222b ln cosh(s) ds \u2248 (t^2)/2 - (ln 2) t + C, but that's an approximation for large t. However, perhaps in this problem, the integral is meant to be handled symbolically, without explicit evaluation. Let me proceed.\n\nThe integrating factor is \u03bc(t) = exp(I(t)) = exp(t ln cosh(t) - \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds).\n\nWait, that's exp(t ln cosh(t)) * exp(- \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds).\n\nBut exp(t ln cosh(t)) = cosh(t)^t. So \u03bc(t) = cosh(t)^t * exp(- \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds). Hmm, but this still looks too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ODE is meant to be solved numerically, but given that the answer requires evaluating x3(ln10^5), which is a specific value, perhaps there's an exact solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in how I'm interpreting the ODE. Let's consider for a moment that the coefficient might be t times h(t), where h(t) is 1. But then the ODE would be x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, which is solvable. Let's check that case. If \"th~t\" was intended to be \"t * 1\", that is, simply t, then the equation becomes x' + t x = e^{-t/3}. Then the integrating factor would be exp(\u222b t dt) = exp(t^2/2), making the solution manageable. But is there a possibility that \"th~t\" is a miswritten \"t * 1\", i.e., t? Perhaps, but that's speculative. However, if that's the case, then the problem becomes much simpler.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the answer format. The expression to compute is (10^5 + 10^{-5})x3(ln10^5) + (3/4)10^{-20/3}. Let's compute 10^{-20/3} which is (10^{5})^{-4/3} since 10^5 = e^{5 ln 10}, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, 10^{-20/3} = e^{-(20/3) ln10}. The term (3/4)10^{-20/3} might be a clue. Suppose that when solving the ODE, this term appears as part of the solution. So maybe the problem is designed so that the complicated integral cancels out when evaluated at t = ln(10^5) = 5 ln10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integrating factor \u03bc(t) when evaluated at t = ln(10^5) has a form that combines with the other terms. Let me try proceeding with the assumption that the coefficient is t tanh(t), and see if the terms can be expressed in a way that allows for simplification.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that when t is large, tanh(t) approaches 1. So for large t, the ODE x' + t x \u2248 e^{-t/3}. However, the solution would then approximate the integrating factor as exp(\u222b t dt) = exp(t^2/2), leading to a solution involving integrals of e^{t^2/2} e^{-t/3} dt, which is not elementary. But given that the answer requires t = ln(10^5) = 5 ln10 \u2248 5*2.3026 \u2248 11.513, which is a relatively large t, but not extremely large. So tanh(11.513) is very close to 1. For example, tanh(5) is already about 0.99991, so tanh(11.5) is practically 1. So perhaps we can approximate tanh(t) as 1 for t >= some value. But the problem might expect an exact answer, so approximation may not be intended.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral of t tanh(t) from 0 to t can be expressed in terms of log functions or something else. Let me try to reconsider the integral.\n\n\u222b t tanh(t) dt. Let's note that tanh(t) = (d/dt) ln cosh(t). So \u222b t tanh(t) dt = t ln cosh(t) - \u222b ln cosh(t) dt.\n\nLet me consider \u222b ln cosh(t) dt. Is there a known expression for this integral? Yes, I recall that \u222b ln cosh(t) dt = (t^2)/2 - (t log(1 + e^{-2t}))/2 - (1/4) Li_2(-e^{-2t}) ) + C. But this involves the dilogarithm function, which is a special function. However, if we proceed, the integrating factor would involve exponential of such terms, which complicates things further.\n\nGiven that this seems too involved, perhaps the original ODE was intended to be simpler. Maybe there's a different interpretation of \"th~t\". For instance, if \"th~t\" is a misrendering of \"t^2\", then the ODE becomes x' + t^2 x = e^{-t/3}, which is solvable with integrating factor \u03bc(t) = exp(\u222b t^2 dt) = exp(t^3/3). Let's test this possibility.\n\nIf the ODE is x' + t^2 x = e^{-t/3}, then integrating factor is \u03bc(t) = e^{t^3/3}. Multiplying both sides:\n\ne^{t^3/3} x' + t^2 e^{t^3/3} x = e^{t^3/3} e^{-t/3} = e^{t^3/3 - t/3}.\n\nThe left side is d/dt [x e^{t^3/3}]. So integrating from 0 to t:\n\nx(t) e^{t^3/3} - x(0) e^{0} = \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^3/3 - s/3} ds.\n\nGiven x(0) = 5, then:\n\nx(t) = e^{-t^3/3} [5 + \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^3/3 - s/3} ds ].\n\nBut evaluating this integral analytically is not straightforward. However, perhaps when evaluating at t = ln(10^5) = 5 ln10, the argument of the exponential s^3/3 - s/3 may simplify. Let's compute s = 5 ln10. Then s^3/3 - s/3 = (s/3)(s^2 - 1). But unless there's a particular relationship here, this may not help. Alternatively, maybe the integral from 0 to t can be expressed in terms of error functions or other special functions, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, if the ODE had a different coefficient, such as t instead of t tanh(t), then the integrating factor would be e^{\u222b t dt} = e^{t^2/2}, leading to a solution involving integrals of e^{-t^2/2}, which again might not be elementary. But perhaps the problem is designed so that the integral cancels out when combined with the other terms in the final expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original ODE has a coefficient that allows for an exact solution. Let's consider if the ODE is x' + t x = e^{-t/3}. Then integrating factor is e^{t^2/2}. Multiplying through:\n\nd/dt [x e^{t^2/2}] = e^{t^2/2} e^{-t/3} = e^{t^2/2 - t/3}.\n\nIntegrate both sides from 0 to t:\n\nx(t) e^{t^2/2} - x(0) = \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds.\n\nThus, x(t) = e^{-t^2/2} [5 + \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds ].\n\nBut again, this integral has no elementary form. However, the problem might involve evaluating this at a specific t, say t = 5 ln10, and then plugging into the given expression. However, without knowing the exact form of the integral, this approach seems unmanageable.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the ambiguity in the original equation, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's re-examine the original problem. The user is asking for the value of (10^5 + 10^{-5})x3(ln10^5) + (3/4)10^{-20/3}. Let me compute 10^{-20/3} as 10^{-6.666...} \u2248 10^{-6} * 10^{-0.6667} \u2248 1e-6 * 0.2154 \u2248 2.154e-7, but exact value might be needed. However, the key part is that the final answer likely combines x3 evaluated at ln(10^5), multiplied by (10^5 + 1e-5), plus a term involving 10^{-20/3}. Perhaps there's a way for these terms to cancel or combine neatly, suggesting that x3(ln10^5) has a component that involves 10^{-5} or similar.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that after solving the ODE, the solution x3(t) involves a term like e^{-t/3}, and when evaluated at t = ln(10^5) = 5 ln10, e^{-5 ln10 /3} = (e^{ln10})^{-5/3} = 10^{-5/3}. Then 10^{-5/3} multiplied by 10^5 would give 10^{5 - 5/3} = 10^{10/3} \u2248 4641.5888. Similarly, 10^{-5/3} multiplied by 10^{-5} gives 10^{-20/3}, which is present in the expression. This suggests that perhaps the solution x3(t) has a term involving 10^{-5/3} when evaluated at t = ln10^5, and combining with the coefficients given in the problem might lead to cancellation or simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution x3(t) is purely e^{-t/3} multiplied by some factor. Let's test that. Suppose x3(t) = C e^{-t/3}. Then substituting into the ODE:\n\nx3'(t) = - (C/3) e^{-t/3}\n\nThe ODE: - (C/3) e^{-t/3} + t tanh(t) C e^{-t/3} = e^{-t/3}\n\nDividing both sides by e^{-t/3}:\n\n- C/3 + t tanh(t) C = 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC ( t tanh(t) - 1/3 ) = 1\n\nBut this requires that t tanh(t) - 1/3 is a constant, which it's not. Hence, this approach doesn't work. Therefore, the solution is not a simple multiple of e^{-t/3}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is x' + t tanh(t) x = 0, which has solution x_h = C exp(-\u222b t tanh(t) dt). The particular solution can be found using variation of parameters. But again, the integral remains problematic.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the possibility that there's a typo in the original equation, perhaps I should consider that the correct ODE is x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, which would make the problem solvable. Let's proceed with this assumption and check if it leads to a plausible answer.\n\nAssuming the ODE is x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, with x(0) = 5. Then the integrating factor is \u03bc(t) = e^{\u222b t dt} = e^{t^2/2}. Multiply both sides:\n\ne^{t^2/2} x' + t e^{t^2/2} x = e^{t^2/2} e^{-t/3} = e^{t^2/2 - t/3}.\n\nThe left side is d/dt [x e^{t^2/2}]. Integrate from 0 to t:\n\nx(t) e^{t^2/2} - x(0) = \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds.\n\nSo x(t) = e^{-t^2/2} [5 + \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds ].\n\nBut evaluating this integral is not straightforward. However, perhaps the problem is designed to recognize that when we evaluate x(ln10^5) = x(5 ln10), then the expression involves 10^{5} and 10^{-5}, leading to the terms in the final answer combining neatly. Let's compute t = 5 ln10. Then t^2/2 = (25 (ln10)^2)/2, and e^{-t^2/2} would be a very small number, but this seems unlikely to result in terms that cancel with 10^5 and 10^{-5}. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral from 0 to t of e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds, when evaluated at t =5 ln10, can be expressed in terms of the error function or another special function, but this would require specific knowledge. However, given the presence of 10^{-20/3} in the expression, which is equal to (10^{5})^{-4/3}, perhaps this term comes from e^{-t/3} evaluated at t=5 ln10, which is e^{-5 ln10 /3} = 10^{-5/3}. Then 10^{-5/3} multiplied by 10^5 is 10^{10/3}, and 10^{-5/3} multiplied by 10^{-5} is 10^{-20/3}, which matches the term in the given expression. \n\nBut how does this relate to the solution x(t)? The particular solution would involve integrating e^{s^2/2 - s/3} from 0 to t, which is not easily expressed. Therefore, perhaps the answer is designed such that when you compute (10^5 + 10^{-5})x3(ln10^5), the integral terms cancel out, leaving only the (3/4)10^{-20/3} term. Alternatively, maybe x3(ln10^5) equals 10^{-5/3} multiplied by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, and the other terms cancel out. Let's test this assumption. If x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, then substituting into the ODE:\n\nx3'(t) = - (1/3) e^{-t/3}\n\nThe ODE becomes - (1/3)e^{-t/3} + t tanh(t) e^{-t/3} = e^{-t/3}\n\nDividing both sides by e^{-t/3}:\n\n-1/3 + t tanh(t) = 1\n\nWhich would require t tanh(t) = 4/3. But tanh(t) is less than 1 for all finite t, so t tanh(t) < t. For t=4/3, tanh(4/3) \u2248 0.928, so 4/3 * 0.928 \u2248 1.237, which is greater than 4/3, but this would require solving t tanh(t) = 4/3, which may have a solution for some t, but this doesn't help for general t. Thus, this assumption is invalid.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the ambiguity in the ODE's coefficient, I think the most plausible path forward is to consider that there was a typo in the original equation, and the correct ODE is x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, leading to a solvable problem. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSolution for x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, x(0)=5.\n\nIntegrating factor \u03bc(t) = e^{\u222b t dt} = e^{t^2/2}.\n\nMultiply both sides:\n\ne^{t^2/2} x' + t e^{t^2/2} x = e^{t^2/2} e^{-t/3} = e^{t^2/2 - t/3}.\n\nIntegrate from 0 to t:\n\nx(t) e^{t^2/2} - x(0) = \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds.\n\nThus,\n\nx(t) = e^{-t^2/2} [5 + \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds ].\n\nNow, evaluate x(ln10^5) = x(5 ln10). Let t =5 ln10.\n\nCompute e^{-t^2/2} = e^{-(25 (ln10)^2)/2}. \n\nBut this term is extremely small because (ln10)^2 \u2248 (2.3026)^2 \u22485.3019, so 25*5.3019 \u2248132.55, divided by 2 gives 66.275. So e^{-66.275} \u2248 a very small number, effectively zero. Similarly, the integral \u222b_{0}^{5 ln10} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds would be dominated by the upper limit where s^2/2 is large, leading to a large value, but multiplied by e^{-66.275}, which approaches zero. However, the product of the integral and e^{-t^2/2} might approach a finite limit.\n\nMoreover, given the presence of 10^{-20/3} in the expression to compute, which is 10^{-20/3} = e^{-(20/3) ln10} \u2248 e^{-6.6667*2.3026} \u2248 e^{-15.351} \u2248 2.13e-7. This term seems unrelated to the solution, but perhaps when combined with the other terms, there's a cancellation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of the error function. The integral of e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds doesn't directly match the error function form, which typically involves e^{-s^2}. However, completing the square in the exponent might help. Let's try that.\n\nThe exponent is s^2/2 - s/3. Let's complete the square:\n\ns^2/2 - s/3 = (1/2)(s^2 - 2s/3) = (1/2)[(s - 1/3)^2 - (1/3)^2] = (1/2)(s - 1/3)^2 - 1/18.\n\nSo e^{s^2/2 - s/3} = e^{(1/2)(s - 1/3)^2 - 1/18} = e^{-1/18} e^{(1/2)(s - 1/3)^2}.\n\nThus, the integral becomes e^{-1/18} \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{(1/2)(s - 1/3)^2} ds.\n\nThis integral is e^{-1/18} times the integral of e^{(1/2)(s - 1/3)^2} ds, which can be expressed in terms of the error function by substitution. Let u = (s - 1/3)/sqrt(2), then du = ds/sqrt(2), and the integral becomes sqrt(2) \u222b e^{u^2} du, which is sqrt(2) * (sqrt(\u03c0)/2) erfi(u) + C, where erfi is the imaginary error function. However, this leads to a non-elementary expression, making it difficult to evaluate exactly.\n\nGiven this complexity, it's unlikely that this is the intended approach. Therefore, I must reconsider my initial assumption about the ODE's coefficient. Perhaps the correct coefficient is t * tanh(t), and the solution involves recognizing that the integrating factor's integral cancels out when evaluating the expression given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after solving the ODE, the expression (10^5 + 10^{-5})x3(ln10^5) combines with the other term to yield a simple result. For example, if x3(ln10^5) equals 10^{-5/3}, then:\n\n(10^5 + 10^{-5}) * 10^{-5/3} = 10^{5} * 10^{-5/3} + 10^{-5} * 10^{-5/3} = 10^{10/3} + 10^{-20/3}.\n\nAdding (3/4)10^{-20/3} would give 10^{10/3} + (1 + 3/4)10^{-20/3} = 10^{10/3} + (7/4)10^{-20/3}. But this doesn't match the required expression. Alternatively, if x3(ln10^5) = 3/4 * 10^{-5/3}, then:\n\n(10^5 + 10^{-5})*(3/4)10^{-5/3} + (3/4)10^{-20/3} = (3/4)(10^{10/3} + 10^{-20/3}) + (3/4)10^{-20/3} = (3/4)10^{10/3} + (3/4 + 3/4)10^{-20/3} = (3/4)10^{10/3} + (3/2)10^{-20/3}, which also doesn't seem to simplify to a clean answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x3(ln10^5) is such that when multiplied by 10^5, it cancels the 10^{-20/3} term. For instance, if x3(ln10^5) = 3/4 * 10^{-25/3}, then 10^5 * x3 = 3/4 *10^{-25/3 +5} = 3/4 *10^{-10/3}, but this seems unrelated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution x3(t) involves e^{-t/3} multiplied by some function that when evaluated at t =5 ln10 results in 10^{-5/3} and terms that cancel with the given expression. Let me consider the integrating factor approach again with the original assumption of tanh(t).\n\nIf the ODE is x' + t tanh(t) x = e^{-t/3}, then the integrating factor \u03bc(t) = exp(\u222b0^t s tanh(s) ds). Let's denote this integral as I(t) = \u222b0^t s tanh(s) ds. As previously, I(t) = t ln cosh(t) - \u222b0^t ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nNow, the solution is:\n\nx(t) = e^{-I(t)} [5 + \u222b0^t e^{I(s)} e^{-s/3} ds ].\n\nBut evaluating this expression at t =5 ln10 would require knowing I(t) and the integral term, which seems intractable. However, perhaps there's a relationship between I(t) and the terms in the final expression. For example, at t =5 ln10, cosh(t) = (e^t + e^{-t})/2. Since t =5 ln10 is a large value (e^t =10^5), e^{-t}=10^{-5}, so cosh(t) \u2248 e^t/2 = 10^5/2. Thus, ln cosh(t) \u2248 t - ln2. Therefore, I(t) = t (t - ln2) - \u222b0^t ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nBut \u222b0^t ln cosh(s) ds \u2248 \u222b0^t (s - ln2) ds for large t, which would be (s^2/2 - ln2 s) from 0 to t: t^2/2 - ln2 t. Thus, I(t) \u2248 t(t - ln2) - (t^2/2 - ln2 t) = t^2 - t ln2 - t^2/2 + ln2 t = t^2/2. Therefore, for large t, the integrating factor \u03bc(t) = exp(I(t)) \u2248 exp(t^2/2).\n\nThus, for large t, the solution x(t) \u2248 e^{-t^2/2} [5 + \u222b0^t e^{s^2/2} e^{-s/3} ds ].\n\nBut again, this leads back to the same complicated integral as before. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to consider that there might be a different approach or that the problem has a specific structure that allows for cancellation.\n\nLet me look at the expression to compute: (10^5 +10^{-5})x3(ln10^5) + (3/4)10^{-20/3}.\n\nIf I denote A = x3(ln10^5), then the expression is (10^5 + 10^{-5})A + (3/4)10^{-20/3}.\n\nPerhaps there's a value of A that makes this expression simple. For example, if A = - (3/4)10^{-20/3}/(10^5 +10^{-5}), then the entire expression would be zero, but that's arbitrary. Alternatively, if the term (10^5 +10^{-5})A cancels out the (3/4)10^{-20/3} term, but without knowing A's value, this is pure speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when solving the ODE, the solution at t =5 ln10 leads to x3(ln10^5) being proportional to 10^{-5/3}, which when multiplied by 10^5 gives 10^{10/3}, and when multiplied by 10^{-5} gives 10^{-5/3 -5} =10^{-20/3}. Then the expression becomes 10^{10/3} +10^{-20/3} + (3/4)10^{-20/3} =10^{10/3} + (7/4)10^{-20/3}, which doesn't seem like a clean answer. However, perhaps the solution x3(ln10^5) is such that when multiplied by (10^5 +10^{-5}), it gives 3/4 *10^{-20/3}, leading to the total expression being 3/4 *10^{-20/3} +3/4 *10^{-20/3}= 3/2 *10^{-20/3}. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've invested without making progress, I think the most plausible answer is that the value simplifies to 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + something that cancels out, leading to an answer of 3/4 *10^{-20/3} multiplied by a factor. However, without the correct ODE solution, this is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is simply 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + something that after computation equals 3/4 *10^{-20/3}, but this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll make an educated guess that the correct answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5}) *x3(ln10^5) where x3(ln10^5) is zero, leading to 3/4 *10^{-20/3}. But this is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the expression evaluates to 3/4*10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5})*0, which would mean 3/4*10^{-20/3}. However, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 3/4*10^{-20/3} + 3/4*10^{-20/3} = 3/2*10^{-20/3}, but there's no basis for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution x3(t) involves a term like 3/4 e^{-t/3}, and when evaluated at t =5 ln10, e^{-5 ln10/3} =10^{-5/3}, so x3(ln10^5)= 3/4 10^{-5/3}, leading to:\n\n(10^5 +10^{-5})*3/4 *10^{-5/3} +3/4*10^{-20/3} = 3/4 [10^{5 -5/3} +10^{-5 -5/3} +10^{-20/3}].\n\nBut 5 -5/3 =10/3, so 10^{10/3}, and -5 -5/3 =-20/3. So this becomes 3/4 [10^{10/3} +10^{-20/3} +10^{-20/3} ]= 3/4 [10^{10/3} +2*10^{-20/3}]. This still doesn't simplify nicely.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear progress, I think I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that the given differential equation might have an integrating factor that when evaluated at t = ln10^5, combines with the other terms in the expression to cancel out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution x3(t) is given by x3(t) = e^{-\u222b P(t) dt} [\u222b e^{\u222b P(t) dt} e^{-t/3} dt + C], and after evaluation, the terms combine with the given expression to yield a simple result.\n\nGiven that this is taking too long and I might not be making progress, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5})* some value that results in the answer being 3/4 *10^{-20/3}*2 or similar. But without the correct computations, I can't be sure.\n\nDue to time constraints and the complexity of the problem as interpreted, I'll proceed to make an educated guess that the answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} multiplied by a certain factor, but given the possible terms, I'll choose the answer as 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5})*0, but this is not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 3, but this is just a wild guess.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} * (10^5 +10^{-5}) * something, but I'm not sure. Given the lack of progress, I'll have to provide an answer with low confidence, but I think the correct answer might be 3/4 *10^{-20/3} * (1 +1) = 3/2 *10^{-20/3}. But this is not based on solid ground. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply 3/4 *10^{-20/3}, but I'm not confident.\n\nAfter struggling with the integral and possible typos, perhaps the answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5})*0, so 3/4 *10^{-20/3}. However, this seems unlikely. Given the time I've spent, I'll settle on this as a possible answer but with very low confidence.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The given differential equation is a first-order linear ODE.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this differential equation problem. The given equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). The standard form for such equations is x'(t) + P(t)x(t) = Q(t). Here, comparing, I can see that P(t) is t h(t) \u2014 wait, wait, the equation is written as \"th~t x3(t)\". Hmm, maybe that's a typo or misinterpretation. Let me check again. The original equation is x3'(t) + t h~t x3(t) = e^(-t/3). Oh, wait, perhaps the \"h~t\" is actually meant to be hyperbolic tangent, which is tanh(t). Because \"tanh\" is sometimes written with a tilde or similar symbols. So maybe the equation is x3'(t) + t * tanh(t) * x3(t) = e^(-t/3). That makes more sense. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo the ODE is x' + t tanh(t) x = e^(-t/3), with the initial condition x(0) = 5. To solve this, I need to find an integrating factor. The integrating factor \u03bc(t) is exp(\u222b P(t) dt), where P(t) is the coefficient of x(t), which here is t tanh(t). So first, compute the integral of t tanh(t) dt. Hmm, integrating t tanh(t)... Let's see. Integration by parts maybe. Let me set u = t, dv = tanh(t) dt. Then du = dt, and v = \u222b tanh(t) dt = ln(cosh(t)) because the integral of tanh(t) is ln(cosh(t)) + C. So integrating by parts, \u222b t tanh(t) dt = t ln(cosh(t)) - \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt. Wait, but the remaining integral \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way or perhaps the integral simplifies under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows for the integrating factor to be expressed in terms of the integral without evaluating it completely. Wait, but maybe there's a different approach here. Let me check if I made a mistake in identifying P(t). Let me confirm again the original equation: x3'(t) + t h~t x3(t) = e^{-t/3}. If \"h~t\" is something else, like hyperbolic cotangent or another function, but \"tanh\" is likely. Alternatively, the notation might be a typo for \"t h(t)\", but that's unclear. But assuming that it's t * tanh(t), then proceeding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x3'(t) + t * h(t) * x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, where h(t) is a given function. But since h(t) isn't defined here, that would be a problem. Wait, the original problem statement doesn't mention any other functions, so \"h~t\" must be a notation for a standard function. So, I think \"tanh(t)\" is the most plausible interpretation here.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed. The integrating factor \u03bc(t) is exp(\u222b t tanh(t) dt). But integrating t tanh(t) is a bit tricky. Let me think again. Let's try expanding tanh(t). Remember that tanh(t) = (e^t - e^{-t})/(e^t + e^{-t}). Maybe substitution? Let u = t, dv = tanh(t) dt. Wait, but as before, integration by parts. Let's proceed:\n\n\u222b t tanh(t) dt = t ln(cosh(t)) - \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt.\n\nHmm, this leaves us with \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt. I'm not sure if this integral has a closed-form expression. Maybe there's another approach. Wait, perhaps instead of computing the integrating factor directly, there's a simplifying substitution. Alternatively, maybe this ODE can be solved using another method. Wait, but for linear first-order ODEs, the integrating factor method is the standard approach. Let me check if there's an alternative way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral \u222b t tanh(t) dt can be expressed in terms of known functions. Let me look up or recall if there's an antiderivative for t tanh(t). Alternatively, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the integral simplifies when evaluated from 0 to t. Let me consider definite integrals. Suppose I compute the integral from 0 to t. So, integrating factor \u03bc(t) is exp(\u222b_{0}^{t} s tanh(s) ds). Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my approach. Let me verify the steps again. The standard solution formula for a linear ODE x' + P(t)x = Q(t) is x(t) = [\u222b \u03bc(s) Q(s) ds + C] / \u03bc(t), where \u03bc(t) = exp(\u222b P(s) ds). So here, P(t) is t tanh(t), which we need to integrate. Let me compute \u222b t tanh(t) dt again. Let's try substitution. Let u = t^2 / 2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Alternatively, series expansion? For small t, tanh(t) \u2248 t - t^3/3 + 2t^5/15 - ..., but integrating term by term might not help here. Alternatively, maybe integrating t tanh(t) can be expressed using the dilogarithm function or something similar. Wait, perhaps not. Let's try integrating by parts again.\n\nLet me set u = t, dv = tanh(t) dt. Then du = dt, v = ln(cosh(t)). So \u222b t tanh(t) dt = t ln(cosh(t)) - \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt. Now, the remaining integral \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt. I know that \u222b ln(cosh(t)) dt can be expressed as (t^2)/2 - (t log(1 + e^{-2t}))/2 - (Li_2(-e^{-2t}))/4 + C, where Li_2 is the dilogarithm function. But this seems complicated and not helpful for the problem at hand. Wait, but maybe in the context of this problem, the integral cancels out or combines in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the integrating factor simplifies when considering the specific form of Q(t) = e^{-t/3}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the original ODE. Let me check once again. The original equation is x3'(t) + t h~t x3(t) = e^{-t/3}. If \"h~t\" is not tanh(t), but maybe something else. For example, if it's a typo for \"t^2\", but that would be written differently. Alternatively, could it be \"ht\" as in a function h(t)? But since h is undefined, that would be an issue. Alternatively, perhaps the tilde is a separator, and the equation is x3' + t h(t) x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, but then h(t) is undefined. That can't be. Therefore, I think the most plausible interpretation is that \"h~t\" is a typo or notation for tanh(t), as originally thought.\n\nGiven that, maybe even though the integral of t tanh(t) is complicated, the problem might have a clever way to proceed. Let's proceed step by step. Let me denote \u03bc(t) = exp(\u222b t tanh(t) dt). Let's compute that integral from 0 to t, since we have an initial condition at t=0. Let me compute the integrating factor:\n\n\u03bc(t) = exp( \u222b_{0}^{t} s tanh(s) ds )\n\nBut how to compute that? Alternatively, perhaps the product t tanh(t) can be rewritten. Wait, note that d/dt (ln cosh(t)) = tanh(t). So \u222b tanh(t) dt = ln cosh(t) + C. But here we have \u222b s tanh(s) ds. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution u = cosh(s), but I don't think that helps here. Let me try integrating by parts again. Let u = s, dv = tanh(s) ds. Then du = ds, v = ln cosh(s). So:\n\n\u222b s tanh(s) ds = s ln cosh(s) - \u222b ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nNow, the integral \u222b ln cosh(s) ds. Let me recall that \u222b ln cosh(s) ds = (s^2)/2 - (s ln(1 + e^{-2s}))/2 - (1/4) Li_2(-e^{-2s}) ) + C. But again, this seems too complex. Perhaps the problem is designed such that when we proceed through the integrating factor, the terms involving Li_2 or others will cancel out. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in approach here. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is x3' + t * h(t) x3 = e^{-t/3}, with h(t) being some function that makes the integrating factor manageable. But since h(t) isn't given, that's not possible. So perhaps my initial assumption about \"h~t\" being tanh(t) is incorrect. Let me try re-examining the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: x3'(t) + th~t x3(t) = e^{-t/3}\n\nMaybe \"th~t\" is a typo for \"t^2\", but that's written as t squared. Alternatively, maybe \"t h(t)\" where h(t) is a function. But no h(t) is provided. Alternatively, maybe \"th~t\" is actually \"t times the Heaviside step function at t\", but that would be unusual notation. Alternatively, perhaps \"h~t\" is a misformatting of \"h(t)\", but again, h(t) is undefined. This is getting confusing. Maybe the problem has a typo. But since we have to work with what's given, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps \"th~t\" is a misinterpreted way of writing \"tanh(t)\". In some contexts, especially in handwriting, \"tanht\" could be written with a tilde over the h, but that's speculative. Assuming that, let's proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"h~t\" is a typo for \"h(t)\", but then since h is undefined, maybe the problem is missing information. But since it's given as part of the problem, perhaps we're supposed to interpret it as a known function. Alternatively, maybe it's a formatting error. For example, maybe the original equation was supposed to be written with a multiplication symbol, like t * h(t), but due to formatting, it became \"th~t\". But without additional context, this is challenging.\n\nAlternatively, could \"h~t\" be a misplaced symbol? For instance, if the equation was supposed to be x3'(t) + t * h(t) x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, but h(t) is defined elsewhere. But since it's not, this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the equation is x3' + t * tanh(t) x3 = e^{-t/3}, as initially thought, and proceed with solving it, even if the integral seems complex. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different function. For instance, if \"h~t\" is intended to represent the hyperbolic cotangent (coth(t)), but that's written as coth(t).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is x3'(t) + t * h(t) x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, and \"h~t\" is a miswritten h(t) = something. But without knowing h(t), this seems impossible. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo and \"th~t\" is supposed to be \"t ht\", and \"ht\" is another variable. But that also seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, let's think if the equation can be written in another way. Perhaps if the equation is x3'(t) + t h(t) x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, and h(t) is given by h(t) = ~t, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the tilde is a formatting error, and the equation is x3' + t h(t) x3 = e^{-t/3}, with h(t) = t. But then that would make the coefficient t^2, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's t multiplied by the function h(t) which is some standard function, like the Heaviside function, but again, that's unclear. Given the lack of clarity here, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that \"th~t\" is intended to be t times tanh(t), as that's a common function and the notation might be a formatting error.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed. So integrating factor \u03bc(t) is exp(\u222b t tanh(t) dt). Let me compute this integral from 0 to t. Let's denote I(t) = \u222b_{0}^{t} s tanh(s) ds. As before, integrating by parts:\n\nLet u = s, dv = tanh(s) ds, then du = ds, v = ln(cosh(s)).\n\nSo, I(t) = s ln cosh(s) evaluated from 0 to t minus \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nSo I(t) = t ln cosh(t) - \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nBut \u222b ln cosh(s) ds from 0 to t can be expressed as (t^2)/2 - (t ln 2)/2 + (1/4) Li_2(-e^{-2t}) ) - (1/4) Li_2(-1) ). Wait, this seems too complicated. Let me recall that \u222b ln cosh(s) ds from 0 to t is (t^2)/2 - (t ln 2) + (1/2) \u222b_{0}^{t} s e^{-2s} ds + ... Hmm, perhaps there's a series expansion. Alternatively, for large t, ln cosh(t) \u2248 t - ln 2, so \u222b ln cosh(s) ds \u2248 (t^2)/2 - (ln 2) t + C, but that's an approximation for large t. However, perhaps in this problem, the integral is meant to be handled symbolically, without explicit evaluation. Let me proceed.\n\nThe integrating factor is \u03bc(t) = exp(I(t)) = exp(t ln cosh(t) - \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds).\n\nWait, that's exp(t ln cosh(t)) * exp(- \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds).\n\nBut exp(t ln cosh(t)) = cosh(t)^t. So \u03bc(t) = cosh(t)^t * exp(- \u222b_{0}^{t} ln cosh(s) ds). Hmm, but this still looks too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ODE is meant to be solved numerically, but given that the answer requires evaluating x3(ln10^5), which is a specific value, perhaps there's an exact solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in how I'm interpreting the ODE. Let's consider for a moment that the coefficient might be t times h(t), where h(t) is 1. But then the ODE would be x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, which is solvable. Let's check that case. If \"th~t\" was intended to be \"t * 1\", that is, simply t, then the equation becomes x' + t x = e^{-t/3}. Then the integrating factor would be exp(\u222b t dt) = exp(t^2/2), making the solution manageable. But is there a possibility that \"th~t\" is a miswritten \"t * 1\", i.e., t? Perhaps, but that's speculative. However, if that's the case, then the problem becomes much simpler.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the answer format. The expression to compute is (10^5 + 10^{-5})x3(ln10^5) + (3/4)10^{-20/3}. Let's compute 10^{-20/3} which is (10^{5})^{-4/3} since 10^5 = e^{5 ln 10}, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, 10^{-20/3} = e^{-(20/3) ln10}. The term (3/4)10^{-20/3} might be a clue. Suppose that when solving the ODE, this term appears as part of the solution. So maybe the problem is designed so that the complicated integral cancels out when evaluated at t = ln(10^5) = 5 ln10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integrating factor \u03bc(t) when evaluated at t = ln(10^5) has a form that combines with the other terms. Let me try proceeding with the assumption that the coefficient is t tanh(t), and see if the terms can be expressed in a way that allows for simplification.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that when t is large, tanh(t) approaches 1. So for large t, the ODE x' + t x \u2248 e^{-t/3}. However, the solution would then approximate the integrating factor as exp(\u222b t dt) = exp(t^2/2), leading to a solution involving integrals of e^{t^2/2} e^{-t/3} dt, which is not elementary. But given that the answer requires t = ln(10^5) = 5 ln10 \u2248 5*2.3026 \u2248 11.513, which is a relatively large t, but not extremely large. So tanh(11.513) is very close to 1. For example, tanh(5) is already about 0.99991, so tanh(11.5) is practically 1. So perhaps we can approximate tanh(t) as 1 for t >= some value. But the problem might expect an exact answer, so approximation may not be intended.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral of t tanh(t) from 0 to t can be expressed in terms of log functions or something else. Let me try to reconsider the integral.\n\n\u222b t tanh(t) dt. Let's note that tanh(t) = (d/dt) ln cosh(t). So \u222b t tanh(t) dt = t ln cosh(t) - \u222b ln cosh(t) dt.\n\nLet me consider \u222b ln cosh(t) dt. Is there a known expression for this integral? Yes, I recall that \u222b ln cosh(t) dt = (t^2)/2 - (t log(1 + e^{-2t}))/2 - (1/4) Li_2(-e^{-2t}) ) + C. But this involves the dilogarithm function, which is a special function. However, if we proceed, the integrating factor would involve exponential of such terms, which complicates things further.\n\nGiven that this seems too involved, perhaps the original ODE was intended to be simpler. Maybe there's a different interpretation of \"th~t\". For instance, if \"th~t\" is a misrendering of \"t^2\", then the ODE becomes x' + t^2 x = e^{-t/3}, which is solvable with integrating factor \u03bc(t) = exp(\u222b t^2 dt) = exp(t^3/3). Let's test this possibility.\n\nIf the ODE is x' + t^2 x = e^{-t/3}, then integrating factor is \u03bc(t) = e^{t^3/3}. Multiplying both sides:\n\ne^{t^3/3} x' + t^2 e^{t^3/3} x = e^{t^3/3} e^{-t/3} = e^{t^3/3 - t/3}.\n\nThe left side is d/dt [x e^{t^3/3}]. So integrating from 0 to t:\n\nx(t) e^{t^3/3} - x(0) e^{0} = \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^3/3 - s/3} ds.\n\nGiven x(0) = 5, then:\n\nx(t) = e^{-t^3/3} [5 + \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^3/3 - s/3} ds ].\n\nBut evaluating this integral analytically is not straightforward. However, perhaps when evaluating at t = ln(10^5) = 5 ln10, the argument of the exponential s^3/3 - s/3 may simplify. Let's compute s = 5 ln10. Then s^3/3 - s/3 = (s/3)(s^2 - 1). But unless there's a particular relationship here, this may not help. Alternatively, maybe the integral from 0 to t can be expressed in terms of error functions or other special functions, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, if the ODE had a different coefficient, such as t instead of t tanh(t), then the integrating factor would be e^{\u222b t dt} = e^{t^2/2}, leading to a solution involving integrals of e^{-t^2/2}, which again might not be elementary. But perhaps the problem is designed so that the integral cancels out when combined with the other terms in the final expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original ODE has a coefficient that allows for an exact solution. Let's consider if the ODE is x' + t x = e^{-t/3}. Then integrating factor is e^{t^2/2}. Multiplying through:\n\nd/dt [x e^{t^2/2}] = e^{t^2/2} e^{-t/3} = e^{t^2/2 - t/3}.\n\nIntegrate both sides from 0 to t:\n\nx(t) e^{t^2/2} - x(0) = \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds.\n\nThus, x(t) = e^{-t^2/2} [5 + \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds ].\n\nBut again, this integral has no elementary form. However, the problem might involve evaluating this at a specific t, say t = 5 ln10, and then plugging into the given expression. However, without knowing the exact form of the integral, this approach seems unmanageable.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the ambiguity in the original equation, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's re-examine the original problem. The user is asking for the value of (10^5 + 10^{-5})x3(ln10^5) + (3/4)10^{-20/3}. Let me compute 10^{-20/3} as 10^{-6.666...} \u2248 10^{-6} * 10^{-0.6667} \u2248 1e-6 * 0.2154 \u2248 2.154e-7, but exact value might be needed. However, the key part is that the final answer likely combines x3 evaluated at ln(10^5), multiplied by (10^5 + 1e-5), plus a term involving 10^{-20/3}. Perhaps there's a way for these terms to cancel or combine neatly, suggesting that x3(ln10^5) has a component that involves 10^{-5} or similar.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that after solving the ODE, the solution x3(t) involves a term like e^{-t/3}, and when evaluated at t = ln(10^5) = 5 ln10, e^{-5 ln10 /3} = (e^{ln10})^{-5/3} = 10^{-5/3}. Then 10^{-5/3} multiplied by 10^5 would give 10^{5 - 5/3} = 10^{10/3} \u2248 4641.5888. Similarly, 10^{-5/3} multiplied by 10^{-5} gives 10^{-20/3}, which is present in the expression. This suggests that perhaps the solution x3(t) has a term involving 10^{-5/3} when evaluated at t = ln10^5, and combining with the coefficients given in the problem might lead to cancellation or simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution x3(t) is purely e^{-t/3} multiplied by some factor. Let's test that. Suppose x3(t) = C e^{-t/3}. Then substituting into the ODE:\n\nx3'(t) = - (C/3) e^{-t/3}\n\nThe ODE: - (C/3) e^{-t/3} + t tanh(t) C e^{-t/3} = e^{-t/3}\n\nDividing both sides by e^{-t/3}:\n\n- C/3 + t tanh(t) C = 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC ( t tanh(t) - 1/3 ) = 1\n\nBut this requires that t tanh(t) - 1/3 is a constant, which it's not. Hence, this approach doesn't work. Therefore, the solution is not a simple multiple of e^{-t/3}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is x' + t tanh(t) x = 0, which has solution x_h = C exp(-\u222b t tanh(t) dt). The particular solution can be found using variation of parameters. But again, the integral remains problematic.\n\nGiven the time I've invested and the possibility that there's a typo in the original equation, perhaps I should consider that the correct ODE is x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, which would make the problem solvable. Let's proceed with this assumption and check if it leads to a plausible answer.\n\nAssuming the ODE is x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, with x(0) = 5. Then the integrating factor is \u03bc(t) = e^{\u222b t dt} = e^{t^2/2}. Multiply both sides:\n\ne^{t^2/2} x' + t e^{t^2/2} x = e^{t^2/2} e^{-t/3} = e^{t^2/2 - t/3}.\n\nThe left side is d/dt [x e^{t^2/2}]. Integrate from 0 to t:\n\nx(t) e^{t^2/2} - x(0) = \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds.\n\nSo x(t) = e^{-t^2/2} [5 + \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds ].\n\nBut evaluating this integral is not straightforward. However, perhaps the problem is designed to recognize that when we evaluate x(ln10^5) = x(5 ln10), then the expression involves 10^{5} and 10^{-5}, leading to the terms in the final answer combining neatly. Let's compute t = 5 ln10. Then t^2/2 = (25 (ln10)^2)/2, and e^{-t^2/2} would be a very small number, but this seems unlikely to result in terms that cancel with 10^5 and 10^{-5}. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral from 0 to t of e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds, when evaluated at t =5 ln10, can be expressed in terms of the error function or another special function, but this would require specific knowledge. However, given the presence of 10^{-20/3} in the expression, which is equal to (10^{5})^{-4/3}, perhaps this term comes from e^{-t/3} evaluated at t=5 ln10, which is e^{-5 ln10 /3} = 10^{-5/3}. Then 10^{-5/3} multiplied by 10^5 is 10^{10/3}, and 10^{-5/3} multiplied by 10^{-5} is 10^{-20/3}, which matches the term in the given expression. \n\nBut how does this relate to the solution x(t)? The particular solution would involve integrating e^{s^2/2 - s/3} from 0 to t, which is not easily expressed. Therefore, perhaps the answer is designed such that when you compute (10^5 + 10^{-5})x3(ln10^5), the integral terms cancel out, leaving only the (3/4)10^{-20/3} term. Alternatively, maybe x3(ln10^5) equals 10^{-5/3} multiplied by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, and the other terms cancel out. Let's test this assumption. If x3(t) = e^{-t/3}, then substituting into the ODE:\n\nx3'(t) = - (1/3) e^{-t/3}\n\nThe ODE becomes - (1/3)e^{-t/3} + t tanh(t) e^{-t/3} = e^{-t/3}\n\nDividing both sides by e^{-t/3}:\n\n-1/3 + t tanh(t) = 1\n\nWhich would require t tanh(t) = 4/3. But tanh(t) is less than 1 for all finite t, so t tanh(t) < t. For t=4/3, tanh(4/3) \u2248 0.928, so 4/3 * 0.928 \u2248 1.237, which is greater than 4/3, but this would require solving t tanh(t) = 4/3, which may have a solution for some t, but this doesn't help for general t. Thus, this assumption is invalid.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the ambiguity in the ODE's coefficient, I think the most plausible path forward is to consider that there was a typo in the original equation, and the correct ODE is x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, leading to a solvable problem. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSolution for x' + t x = e^{-t/3}, x(0)=5.\n\nIntegrating factor \u03bc(t) = e^{\u222b t dt} = e^{t^2/2}.\n\nMultiply both sides:\n\ne^{t^2/2} x' + t e^{t^2/2} x = e^{t^2/2} e^{-t/3} = e^{t^2/2 - t/3}.\n\nIntegrate from 0 to t:\n\nx(t) e^{t^2/2} - x(0) = \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds.\n\nThus,\n\nx(t) = e^{-t^2/2} [5 + \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds ].\n\nNow, evaluate x(ln10^5) = x(5 ln10). Let t =5 ln10.\n\nCompute e^{-t^2/2} = e^{-(25 (ln10)^2)/2}. \n\nBut this term is extremely small because (ln10)^2 \u2248 (2.3026)^2 \u22485.3019, so 25*5.3019 \u2248132.55, divided by 2 gives 66.275. So e^{-66.275} \u2248 a very small number, effectively zero. Similarly, the integral \u222b_{0}^{5 ln10} e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds would be dominated by the upper limit where s^2/2 is large, leading to a large value, but multiplied by e^{-66.275}, which approaches zero. However, the product of the integral and e^{-t^2/2} might approach a finite limit.\n\nMoreover, given the presence of 10^{-20/3} in the expression to compute, which is 10^{-20/3} = e^{-(20/3) ln10} \u2248 e^{-6.6667*2.3026} \u2248 e^{-15.351} \u2248 2.13e-7. This term seems unrelated to the solution, but perhaps when combined with the other terms, there's a cancellation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of the error function. The integral of e^{s^2/2 - s/3} ds doesn't directly match the error function form, which typically involves e^{-s^2}. However, completing the square in the exponent might help. Let's try that.\n\nThe exponent is s^2/2 - s/3. Let's complete the square:\n\ns^2/2 - s/3 = (1/2)(s^2 - 2s/3) = (1/2)[(s - 1/3)^2 - (1/3)^2] = (1/2)(s - 1/3)^2 - 1/18.\n\nSo e^{s^2/2 - s/3} = e^{(1/2)(s - 1/3)^2 - 1/18} = e^{-1/18} e^{(1/2)(s - 1/3)^2}.\n\nThus, the integral becomes e^{-1/18} \u222b_{0}^{t} e^{(1/2)(s - 1/3)^2} ds.\n\nThis integral is e^{-1/18} times the integral of e^{(1/2)(s - 1/3)^2} ds, which can be expressed in terms of the error function by substitution. Let u = (s - 1/3)/sqrt(2), then du = ds/sqrt(2), and the integral becomes sqrt(2) \u222b e^{u^2} du, which is sqrt(2) * (sqrt(\u03c0)/2) erfi(u) + C, where erfi is the imaginary error function. However, this leads to a non-elementary expression, making it difficult to evaluate exactly.\n\nGiven this complexity, it's unlikely that this is the intended approach. Therefore, I must reconsider my initial assumption about the ODE's coefficient. Perhaps the correct coefficient is t * tanh(t), and the solution involves recognizing that the integrating factor's integral cancels out when evaluating the expression given in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after solving the ODE, the expression (10^5 + 10^{-5})x3(ln10^5) combines with the other term to yield a simple result. For example, if x3(ln10^5) equals 10^{-5/3}, then:\n\n(10^5 + 10^{-5}) * 10^{-5/3} = 10^{5} * 10^{-5/3} + 10^{-5} * 10^{-5/3} = 10^{10/3} + 10^{-20/3}.\n\nAdding (3/4)10^{-20/3} would give 10^{10/3} + (1 + 3/4)10^{-20/3} = 10^{10/3} + (7/4)10^{-20/3}. But this doesn't match the required expression. Alternatively, if x3(ln10^5) = 3/4 * 10^{-5/3}, then:\n\n(10^5 + 10^{-5})*(3/4)10^{-5/3} + (3/4)10^{-20/3} = (3/4)(10^{10/3} + 10^{-20/3}) + (3/4)10^{-20/3} = (3/4)10^{10/3} + (3/4 + 3/4)10^{-20/3} = (3/4)10^{10/3} + (3/2)10^{-20/3}, which also doesn't seem to simplify to a clean answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x3(ln10^5) is such that when multiplied by 10^5, it cancels the 10^{-20/3} term. For instance, if x3(ln10^5) = 3/4 * 10^{-25/3}, then 10^5 * x3 = 3/4 *10^{-25/3 +5} = 3/4 *10^{-10/3}, but this seems unrelated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution x3(t) involves e^{-t/3} multiplied by some function that when evaluated at t =5 ln10 results in 10^{-5/3} and terms that cancel with the given expression. Let me consider the integrating factor approach again with the original assumption of tanh(t).\n\nIf the ODE is x' + t tanh(t) x = e^{-t/3}, then the integrating factor \u03bc(t) = exp(\u222b0^t s tanh(s) ds). Let's denote this integral as I(t) = \u222b0^t s tanh(s) ds. As previously, I(t) = t ln cosh(t) - \u222b0^t ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nNow, the solution is:\n\nx(t) = e^{-I(t)} [5 + \u222b0^t e^{I(s)} e^{-s/3} ds ].\n\nBut evaluating this expression at t =5 ln10 would require knowing I(t) and the integral term, which seems intractable. However, perhaps there's a relationship between I(t) and the terms in the final expression. For example, at t =5 ln10, cosh(t) = (e^t + e^{-t})/2. Since t =5 ln10 is a large value (e^t =10^5), e^{-t}=10^{-5}, so cosh(t) \u2248 e^t/2 = 10^5/2. Thus, ln cosh(t) \u2248 t - ln2. Therefore, I(t) = t (t - ln2) - \u222b0^t ln cosh(s) ds.\n\nBut \u222b0^t ln cosh(s) ds \u2248 \u222b0^t (s - ln2) ds for large t, which would be (s^2/2 - ln2 s) from 0 to t: t^2/2 - ln2 t. Thus, I(t) \u2248 t(t - ln2) - (t^2/2 - ln2 t) = t^2 - t ln2 - t^2/2 + ln2 t = t^2/2. Therefore, for large t, the integrating factor \u03bc(t) = exp(I(t)) \u2248 exp(t^2/2).\n\nThus, for large t, the solution x(t) \u2248 e^{-t^2/2} [5 + \u222b0^t e^{s^2/2} e^{-s/3} ds ].\n\nBut again, this leads back to the same complicated integral as before. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to consider that there might be a different approach or that the problem has a specific structure that allows for cancellation.\n\nLet me look at the expression to compute: (10^5 +10^{-5})x3(ln10^5) + (3/4)10^{-20/3}.\n\nIf I denote A = x3(ln10^5), then the expression is (10^5 + 10^{-5})A + (3/4)10^{-20/3}.\n\nPerhaps there's a value of A that makes this expression simple. For example, if A = - (3/4)10^{-20/3}/(10^5 +10^{-5}), then the entire expression would be zero, but that's arbitrary. Alternatively, if the term (10^5 +10^{-5})A cancels out the (3/4)10^{-20/3} term, but without knowing A's value, this is pure speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when solving the ODE, the solution at t =5 ln10 leads to x3(ln10^5) being proportional to 10^{-5/3}, which when multiplied by 10^5 gives 10^{10/3}, and when multiplied by 10^{-5} gives 10^{-5/3 -5} =10^{-20/3}. Then the expression becomes 10^{10/3} +10^{-20/3} + (3/4)10^{-20/3} =10^{10/3} + (7/4)10^{-20/3}, which doesn't seem like a clean answer. However, perhaps the solution x3(ln10^5) is such that when multiplied by (10^5 +10^{-5}), it gives 3/4 *10^{-20/3}, leading to the total expression being 3/4 *10^{-20/3} +3/4 *10^{-20/3}= 3/2 *10^{-20/3}. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've invested without making progress, I think the most plausible answer is that the value simplifies to 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + something that cancels out, leading to an answer of 3/4 *10^{-20/3} multiplied by a factor. However, without the correct ODE solution, this is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is simply 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + something that after computation equals 3/4 *10^{-20/3}, but this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll make an educated guess that the correct answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5}) *x3(ln10^5) where x3(ln10^5) is zero, leading to 3/4 *10^{-20/3}. But this is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the expression evaluates to 3/4*10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5})*0, which would mean 3/4*10^{-20/3}. However, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 3/4*10^{-20/3} + 3/4*10^{-20/3} = 3/2*10^{-20/3}, but there's no basis for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution x3(t) involves a term like 3/4 e^{-t/3}, and when evaluated at t =5 ln10, e^{-5 ln10/3} =10^{-5/3}, so x3(ln10^5)= 3/4 10^{-5/3}, leading to:\n\n(10^5 +10^{-5})*3/4 *10^{-5/3} +3/4*10^{-20/3} = 3/4 [10^{5 -5/3} +10^{-5 -5/3} +10^{-20/3}].\n\nBut 5 -5/3 =10/3, so 10^{10/3}, and -5 -5/3 =-20/3. So this becomes 3/4 [10^{10/3} +10^{-20/3} +10^{-20/3} ]= 3/4 [10^{10/3} +2*10^{-20/3}]. This still doesn't simplify nicely.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear progress, I think I should look for a different approach. Let's consider that the given differential equation might have an integrating factor that when evaluated at t = ln10^5, combines with the other terms in the expression to cancel out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution x3(t) is given by x3(t) = e^{-\u222b P(t) dt} [\u222b e^{\u222b P(t) dt} e^{-t/3} dt + C], and after evaluation, the terms combine with the given expression to yield a simple result.\n\nGiven that this is taking too long and I might not be making progress, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5})* some value that results in the answer being 3/4 *10^{-20/3}*2 or similar. But without the correct computations, I can't be sure.\n\nDue to time constraints and the complexity of the problem as interpreted, I'll proceed to make an educated guess that the answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} multiplied by a certain factor, but given the possible terms, I'll choose the answer as 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5})*0, but this is not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 3, but this is just a wild guess.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} * (10^5 +10^{-5}) * something, but I'm not sure. Given the lack of progress, I'll have to provide an answer with low confidence, but I think the correct answer might be 3/4 *10^{-20/3} * (1 +1) = 3/2 *10^{-20/3}. But this is not based on solid ground. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply 3/4 *10^{-20/3}, but I'm not confident.\n\nAfter struggling with the integral and possible typos, perhaps the answer is 3/4 *10^{-20/3} + (10^5 +10^{-5})*0, so 3/4 *10^{-20/3}. However, this seems unlikely. Given the time I've spent, I'll settle on this as a possible answer but with very low confidence.",
