  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 there are. Hmm, I remember that Weyl groups are associated with root systems and Lie algebras. The classification of finite Weyl groups corresponds to the classification of simple Lie algebras. Each simple Lie algebra has a root system, and the Weyl group is the reflection group generated by the roots.\n\nSo, the simple Lie algebras are classified into four infinite families (A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n) and five exceptional cases (E6, E7, E8, F4, G2). Each of these corresponds to a different root system and thus a different Weyl group. But the question is specifically about rank 4. \n\nRank refers to the number of simple roots, which is the dimension of the space the root system lives in. So, for rank 4, we need to look at the Weyl groups associated with the simple Lie algebras of rank 4.\n\nLet me list out the possible types. The infinite families for rank 4 would be:\n\n- A4 (which corresponds to the Lie algebra sl(5)) since A_n has rank n, so A4 is rank 4.\n- B4 (so(9)) because B_n is rank n.\n- C4 (sp(8)) similarly, C_n is rank n.\n- D4 (so(8)), D_n is rank n.\n\nAdditionally, there's the exceptional Lie algebra F4, which is of rank 4. The other exceptional algebras like E6, E7, E8 have higher ranks (6,7,8 respectively) and G2 is rank 2. So F4 is the only exceptional one of rank 4.\n\nNow, each of these types (A4, B4, C4, D4, F4) would correspond to a distinct Weyl group. But wait, aren't some of them isomorphic? For example, in lower ranks, some Weyl groups might coincide. For instance, B_n and C_n are isomorphic for the same n because their root systems are dual, but their Weyl groups are the same. Wait, but maybe their Weyl groups are isomorphic even if the root systems are different. Let me check.\n\nThe Weyl group of B_n and C_n is the same, right? Because the root systems for B_n and C_n are dual, but the Weyl group is the hyperoctahedral group, which is the same for both. So in terms of group structure, B_n and C_n have isomorphic Weyl groups. For example, B3 and C3 would have the same Weyl group. So, in rank 4, B4 and C4 would have isomorphic Weyl groups. Therefore, B4 and C4 would count as one isomorphic type.\n\nSimilarly, what about D4? The Weyl group of D4 is a subgroup of the Weyl group of B4, right? Because D_n is a different root system. Wait, but the Weyl group for D4 is the same as the Weyl group for B3? No, D_n is a different series. Wait, the Weyl group of D4 is the same as the Weyl group of B4? No, I think they are different. Let me recall: the Weyl group of Bn is the hyperoctahedral group of order 2^(n-1) n!, and the Weyl group of Dn is a subgroup of index 2 in that group. So, for example, D4's Weyl group is a subgroup of B4's Weyl group. Therefore, D4's Weyl group is a different group from B4's, so they are non-isomorphic.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For Bn, the Weyl group is the semidirect product of S_n (the symmetric group) and (Z/2Z)^n, acting by permutations and sign changes. The Weyl group of Dn is the semidirect product of S_n and (Z/2Z)^(n-1), where the sign changes are even in number. So for n=4, B4's Weyl group is order 2^4 * 4! = 16*24=384; D4's Weyl group is order 2^3 *4! = 8*24=192. So they are different in order, so they are non-isomorphic. Therefore, B4 and D4 are different Weyl groups. Wait, but what about C4? Since B4 and C4 have isomorphic Weyl groups, because their Weyl groups are the same hyperoctahedral group. So in rank 4, B4 and C4 would correspond to the same Weyl group. So they count as one.\n\nThen, the distinct Weyl groups of rank 4 would be:\n\n- A4: symmetric group S_5? Wait, the Weyl group of A_n is the symmetric group S_{n+1}. So A4 would have Weyl group S_5, which is order 120.\n\n- B4/C4: hyperoctahedral group of order 2^4 *4! = 16*24=384.\n\n- D4: Weyl group of order 192 as above.\n\n- F4: The Weyl group of F4 is a different group. Its order is 1152. So that's definitely distinct.\n\nSo, in total, how many? A4 (type A), B4/C4 (type B/C), D4 (type D), F4 (type F). So four distinct non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nWait, but does D4 have any automorphism that might lead to other isomorphisms? For example, D4 is the only one in the D series that has triality, but the Weyl group itself is still a distinct group. I think that D4's Weyl group is different from the others. So that would be four types: A, B/C, D, F. Hence, four non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nSo the answer should be 4. Let me verify once more. For each Lie type of rank 4:\n\n- A4: unique.\n\n- B4 and C4: same Weyl group.\n\n- D4: unique.\n\n- F4: unique.\n\nSo total of 4 distinct Weyl groups. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: Finite Weyl groups of rank 4 correspond to the root systems of simple Lie algebras of rank 4. These include the classical types \\(A_4\\), \\(B_4/C_4\\) (isomorphic Weyl groups), \\(D_4\\), and the exceptional type \\(F_4\\). Although \\(B_4\\) and \\(C_4\\) root systems are dual, their Weyl groups are isomorphic. \\(D_4\\) and \\(F_4\\) are distinct. Thus, there are **4** non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nAnswer: 4  \nConfidence: 100%",
