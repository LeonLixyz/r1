  "question": "For the E8 root system, how many topologically distinct Morse functions exist with exactly three critical values when considered on the quotient by the Weyl group?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many topologically distinct Morse functions exist with exactly three critical values for the E8 root system when considered on the quotient by the Weyl group. Hmm, let's start by recalling some concepts.\n\nFirst, the E8 root system is a complex structure with 240 roots, and it's related to Lie algebras. The Weyl group here is the symmetry group associated with E8. When we take the quotient by the Weyl group, we're essentially looking at the orbit space where each point is an orbit under the Weyl group action. So the quotient space should have some specific topological structure.\n\nMorse functions are smooth functions where critical points are non-degenerate and have distinct critical values. A Morse function with exactly three critical values would have minima, saddles, and maxima, but here the number of critical values is three. Wait, normally, Morse functions on a manifold can have multiple critical points, but critical values are the function's values at those points. If there are three critical values, then all critical points are mapped to three distinct values.\n\nBut the question is about topologically distinct Morse functions. Topological distinctness here probably means that the functions are not related by homeomorphisms of the underlying space. So two Morse functions are equivalent if there's a homeomorphism of the quotient space that maps the critical points of one to those of the other while preserving the critical values.\n\nNow, the quotient space for the E8 root system under the Weyl group. I remember that for a root system, the quotient of the Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group is isomorphic to affine space, or maybe a certain algebraic variety. Wait, in the case of E8, the Weyl group acts on the Cartan subalgebra, and the quotient space is a complex algebraic variety. But more importantly, topologically, what is this quotient? For example, in the case of SU(2), the quotient by the Weyl group (which is the symmetric group on two elements) might give a simpler space, but E8 is much more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quotient space here is a simplex or some polytope? Because Weyl groups often act as reflection groups, and their fundamental domains are simplices. So the quotient space could be a simplex. For example, in type A_n, the Weyl group is the symmetric group S_{n+1}, and the quotient of the Cartan subalgebra (which is a torus) might lead to a simplex as the fundamental domain. But for E8, the fundamental domain is a simplex of 8 dimensions? Or maybe another shape.\n\nWait, but the key point is the topology of the quotient space. If the quotient is a simplex, then topologically it's a disk. But Morse functions on a disk with three critical values. Let's think: For a compact manifold, the number of critical points of a Morse function relates to its topology via Morse inequalities. But here, the quotient might be a compact space. However, the exact structure is crucial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quotient space is a simply connected space. For E8, which is simply laced, perhaps the quotient is a sphere? But that seems unlikely. Maybe it's a more complex space. Alternatively, maybe the quotient is homeomorphic to a certain stratified space.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with three critical values on a given manifold relates to the possible ways to decompose the manifold into handles corresponding to the critical points. Each critical point of index k corresponds to a k-handle. However, when considering critical values, having three critical values would mean that all critical points with the lowest critical value are minima (index 0), then the next value could have critical points of higher index, and the highest value would have maxima (index n for an n-dimensional manifold). But how does this split when we have three critical values?\n\nWait, but the problem is specifically about the quotient by the Weyl group. Maybe this quotient space has a particular cell structure. For instance, in the case of ADE root systems, the quotient spaces might have cell decompositions related to the Coxeter complex. The number of cells in each dimension could influence the possible Morse functions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the Weyl group acts as a reflection group, and the quotient space could be a fundamental chamber. The fundamental chamber for E8 is an 8-dimensional simplex. If the quotient space is homeomorphic to this simplex, then Morse functions on the simplex with three critical values. But a simplex is a convex polytope, which is contractible, so its topology is trivial. However, Morse functions on a simplex could have critical points at vertices, edges, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more algebraic. The number of topologically distinct Morse functions might relate to the number of orbits under some group action or the structure of the poset of critical points. Alternatively, in the context of singularity theory, maybe this is related to the number of possible Cerf decompositions or something else.\n\nWait, I recall that in the study of hyperplane arrangements, the number of possible Morse functions or combinatorial types might relate to the number of regions or chambers. But here, for the quotient by the Weyl group, the arrangement would be the Coxeter arrangement, and the chambers are the Weyl chambers. But perhaps the quotient collapses all chambers into one, so the quotient is the fundamental chamber.\n\nAlternatively, there's a result by someone (maybe Brieskorn or Slodowy) regarding singularities related to root systems. The quotient of the Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group for E8 is known to be a singularity of type E8, which is a hypersurface singularity in C^8. However, the topology of this quotient might be more involved.\n\nBut perhaps this is a question related to the number of conjugacy classes or something else. Wait, no. The question is about Morse functions on the quotient space with three critical values. Each Morse function's critical points must lie in different orbits, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, since the Weyl group quotient is an orbifold, maybe we need to consider Morse functions on orbifolds. But I'm not sure how that affects the count.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Dynkin diagram of E8, which has certain nodes. The number of distinct Morse functions might correspond to the number of ways to color the nodes or some combinatorial structure. For example, assigning critical values to nodes in the Dynkin diagram, but that seems vague.\n\nWait, another angle: the quotient space for E8 under the Weyl group is an 8-dimensional space, and a Morse function on it would have critical points of various indices. But with three critical values, perhaps these correspond to the minimum, a saddle, and the maximum. But how does that split in 8 dimensions? Wait, in n-dimensional manifold, you can have critical points of index 0 to n. But if you have three critical values, you might group critical points of different indices under the same critical value. But for topological distinctness, the arrangement of these critical points and their indices matter.\n\nBut perhaps in this specific case, due to the structure of the E8 quotient, the number of such Morse functions is determined by the number of vertices in some graph or poset related to the root system. Alternatively, maybe each Morse function corresponds to a choice of a subset of the roots with certain properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a known result in Lie theory. Let me think. For example, in the study of Coxeter groups and their geometric representations, the number of conjugacy classes of elements or reflection subgroups might play a role. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a thought. The quotient space for E8 by its Weyl group is an affine variety, and the number of critical points of a Morse function on it relates to its singularities. But since we are considering Morse functions with three critical values, perhaps this corresponds to the simple singularities classification. However, E8 is already a simple singularity, so maybe the number of Morse functions here corresponds to the Milnor number or something else. But the Milnor number for E8 is 8, which counts the number of vanishing cycles. Not sure if that's related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a question about the number of W-orbits in some set. But if the quotient is taken, then points in the quotient correspond to W-orbits. So a Morse function on the quotient would be a function that is invariant under W, hence descending from a W-invariant function on the original space. But the critical points of such a function would correspond to critical orbits. So the number of critical orbits is three.\n\nBut the problem says \"exactly three critical values\", so each critical orbit is assigned a distinct critical value, but multiple critical orbits can have the same critical value. Wait no, if the function is on the quotient space, then each point in the quotient is an orbit, so each critical point in the quotient is a single critical orbit. So having exactly three critical values would mean there are three critical orbits in the original space, each assigned a distinct value. But topological distinctness would require that the configuration of these orbits can't be transformed into each other via homeomorphism.\n\nBut perhaps for the E8 quotient, the number of such Morse functions is related to the number of vertices, edges, and higher-dimensional cells in some decomposition. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula from combinatorics.\n\nWait, I recall that in some cases, the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with a certain number of critical points can be determined by the number of possible ways to attach handles. But without knowing the specific topology of the quotient space, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is related to the Coxeter number of E8. The Coxeter number for E8 is 30. But I don't see a direct connection here.\n\nWait, maybe the number is 3, 4, or some small number. But why? If the quotient space is simply connected and has a certain homology, perhaps the number is determined by the Betti numbers. But for example, if the quotient is a sphere, then a Morse function with three critical points would be the minimum, the maximum, and one saddle. But a sphere in n dimensions has a standard Morse function with two critical points. Wait, no\u2014on an n-sphere, the standard height function has two critical points: min and max. So if someone has three critical values, there must be at least three critical points. So maybe the quotient space is not a sphere.\n\nAlternatively, if the quotient is a space with a more complex topology. For E8, perhaps the quotient has a Betti number that allows for three critical points. But I don't know the Betti numbers of the quotient space.\n\nAlternatively, this might be a trick question. Maybe the number is 1, because there's only one such Morse function up to topological equivalence. But why?\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in the context of the ADE classification, certain invariants correspond to the number of vertices minus one, or other combinatorial data, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be 4, as in E8's rank is 8, but that's just a guess. Wait, perhaps the number relates to the exponents of the Weyl group. The exponents of E8 are 1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29. The number of exponents is 8, but again, I don't see the connection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number is given by the number of nilpotent orbits with three parts in their Jordan decomposition. But that's in representation theory.\n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal number of critical points. For the quotient space, if it's a 8-dimensional manifold (which I doubt, as quotient by a Weyl group often results in singular spaces unless we take the smooth part), but if it's an orbifold, Morse theory still applies in some sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2. Because maybe there's two distinct ways to assign the critical values. But this is pure speculation.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might reference the fact that the E8 quotient has a certain stratification, and the number of topologically distinct Morse functions corresponds to the number of strata of a certain dimension. But without knowing the exact stratification, this is hard.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. In the paper \"Morse functions on symmetric spaces and the classical groups\" by someone, maybe there's a result. Alternatively, in the case of the quotient by the Weyl group, the invariant polynomials are generated by fundamental degrees. For E8, the algebra of invariant polynomials is a polynomial algebra generated by homogeneous polynomials of degrees 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30. These are the exponents plus one.\n\nBut Morse functions are related to functions with non-degenerate critical points. If we take a function on the quotient, which is the spectrum of the invariant polynomials, which is an affine space. The quotient space is the base space of the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem, which states that the quotient is smooth if and only if the group is generated by reflections, which it is for Weyl groups. Wait, no\u2014the quotient of a vector space by a finite reflection group is isomorphic to an affine space. So the quotient for E8's Weyl group acting on the Cartan subalgebra is an affine space of dimension 8, which is just C^8. Wait, but topologically, C^8 is contractible, so as a manifold it's trivial. But Morse functions on contractible spaces can't have maxima unless you compactify it. Wait, but the original Cartan subalgebra is a real vector space, right? So the Weyl group acts on a real vector space h, which is the Cartan subalgebra. The quotient h/W is isomorphic to R^8, since the Weyl group is a finite reflection group. By Chevalley's theorem, the ring of invariant polynomials is a polynomial ring, so the quotient is indeed an affine space. So the quotient space is homeomorphic to R^8.\n\nBut Morse functions on R^8 with three critical values. But R^8 is non-compact. However, maybe the question is considering a compactification or the function is proper. Wait, but Morse functions on non-compact manifolds can have infinitely many critical points. However, the problem specifies exactly three critical values. That would require that there are three critical points (each with a distinct value), but on R^8, you can have such functions. For example, a function with a minimum, a saddle, and another saddle, but in higher dimensions. However, in that case, the topology of the function's critical points would depend on their indices. But the problem says \"topologically distinct\", which in this context would mean that the functions are not related by homeomorphisms of the quotient space (which is R^8) preserving the critical points.\n\nBut in R^8, any two Morse functions with three critical points (say, one minimum, one saddle, and another saddle of different index) could be homeomorphic if their critical points can be mapped to each other. However, the indices of the critical points affect the topological type. For instance, a function with a minimum (index 0), a critical point of index 1, and another of index 2 would be different from one with indices 0, 3, and 5. But the problem states \"three critical values\", so three distinct critical points. Wait, but each critical value can correspond to multiple critical points. Wait, no. Each critical value is the value of the function at a critical point. So if we have three critical values, then each critical point has its own value, or multiple critical points share a value. Wait, the problem says \"exactly three critical values\". So all critical points are mapped to three distinct values. For example, one critical value could correspond to several critical points (all with the same value). But Morse functions typically have distinct critical values for each critical point. Unless you allow for multiple critical points with the same value, but the problem says \"exactly three critical values\", implying that all critical points are mapped to three values. However, the count of critical points per value is not specified. Wait, but Morse functions usually have distinct critical values. However, the problem seems to allow multiple critical points per value, but only three different values.\n\nBut in standard Morse theory, functions are often assumed to have distinct critical values (for ease), but the problem here allows three values. So for instance, the function could have several critical points at the first value, several at the second, and several at the third. Then the question is about the number of topologically distinct such functions.\n\nHowever, the E8 quotient space is R^8, which is contractible. So any Morse function on R^8 with three critical values must have critical points that are, say, a minimum, a saddle, and another saddle. But in R^8, the minimal number of critical points for a Morse function is one (a minimum, for instance). But adding more critical points would involve having functions that perhaps have a min, then some saddles. However, precisely, in R^n, you can have Morse functions with any number of critical points.\n\nBut how does the topology of the quotient space (R^8) affect the number of topologically distinct Morse functions? If the space is homeomorphic to R^8, then all such Morse functions are determined by the number and indices of their critical points. However, for two Morse functions to be topologically equivalent, there must exist a homeomorphism of R^8 that maps the critical points of one to those of the other and preserves the critical values.\n\nSo suppose we have a Morse function on R^8 with three critical values, each corresponding to a single critical point. Then the indices of these critical points could vary. For example, one could have a minimum (index 0), a saddle (index k), and another saddle (index m). The distinctness would depend on the indices. Alternatively, if there are multiple critical points per critical value, their configuration in space would matter.\n\nBut the problem states \"topologically distinct Morse functions with exactly three critical values\". So if two such functions have critical points arranged in a way that can be mapped to each other via a homeomorphism, they are equivalent. So for R^8, the classification would depend on the configuration of the critical points and their indices.\n\nHowever, in R^n, the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with given critical points is determined by the indices and the possible ways to \"embed\" them into the space. For example, in R^2, a function with a min, a saddle, and a max would be distinct from one with two minima and a saddle if the indices or the order differ. But in higher dimensions, it's more complicated.\n\nBut for R^8, which is contractible, the possible Morse functions with three critical values would be classified by the indices of the critical points. Each critical value can correspond to multiple critical points of different indices, but since we have three critical values, maybe each value corresponds to critical points of the same index.\n\nWait, but perhaps the answer is determined by the number of possible combinations of indices allowed for critical points in such a function. For example, in R^8, if we have three critical points with indices 0, 4, and 8, that could be a possibility. Or another combination. Each combination would give a different topological type.\n\nBut since the function is on R^8, which is contractible, the existence of a maximum (index 8) is impossible unless the function is proper and the maximum is at infinity. But Morse functions on non-compact manifolds may not have maxima. Hmm. Wait, but in R^8, a Morse function can have local maxima, but they aren't global maxima because the function can go to infinity. But if we require the function to be proper (so that preimages of compact sets are compact), then maybe, but the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps the critical points could be of any index.\n\nBut in that case, how many topologically distinct Morse functions are there? For each possible distribution of indices among three critical points, we could have a different topological type. For example:\n\n1. Index 0, 1, 2\n2. Index 0, 1, 3\n3. etc.\n\nBut since the order of the critical values matters (i.e., which index is assigned to which critical value), but topological equivalence would allow reordering via homeomorphism. Wait, no. The critical values are real numbers, so they have an order. So the Morse function can't have higher critical values assigned to lower indices in a way that's incompatible with their positions. But in R^8, you could have the critical points arranged along a line, so their critical values are ordered. If two functions have their critical points ordered differently, but the indices are the same, they might still be equivalent if you can permute them via a homeomorphism. But in R^8, homeomorphisms can be quite flexible, but permuting critical points would require that their stable and unstable manifolds don't interfere.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe there's a standard result here. Considering that the question is about the E8 root system quotient by the Weyl group, which is R^8, and we're to count topologically distinct Morse functions with three critical values. But I don't recall a specific number here. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is related to the number of vertices in the E8 Dynkin diagram, which is 8, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, the number of simple roots, which is 8 for E8. Still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking for known results. I recall that in the study of singularities, the E8 singularity has Milnor number 8, but again, not sure. If the quotient space has an E8 singularity, maybe the number of Morse functions is related to the Milnor number. But the Milnor number counts the number of vanishing cycles, not directly Morse functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 3. Because the three critical values correspond to the three conjugacy classes of some subgroups. But I don't know the conjugacy classes of the E8 Weyl group. The number of conjugacy classes for E8's Weyl group is 112, but that's too large.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 1. If all such Morse functions are equivalent under the homeomorphism group of the quotient space. But I doubt that. If the quotient is R^8, then homeomorphisms are flexible, but critical points with different indices would not be equivalent.\n\nWait, suppose we have three critical points with indices 0,1,2. Can a homeomorphism of R^8 rearrange their positions? Yes, but since their indices are different, they are topologically distinct. So each distinct set of indices would give a different topological type. However, the problem says \"exactly three critical values\", which could correspond to any number of critical points, but each assigned to one of three values. Wait, but Morse functions typically have each critical point with a distinct critical value, but if the problem allows multiple critical points at the same value, then you can have more critical points. However, in that case, their indices must be the same, because a small perturbation would split them into distinct critical values if their indices differ. Wait, no. If two critical points have the same index and are in different locations, a small perturbation can separate their critical values. But if they have different indices, they can still be at the same value. But in Morse theory, the Morse function is chosen so that each critical point has a distinct critical value. So if the problem allows for three critical values, each of which may have several critical points, but all with the same index? For example, three critical values, each with one or more critical points. But topological distinctness would then depend on the number and indices of critical points at each value.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Since I don't have the specific knowledge, I might need to make an educated guess. Given that the E8 root system's quotient by the Weyl group is R^8, and we're looking for Morse functions with three critical values, I need to see if there's a standard count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a question related to the real locus of the quotient. For example, the real quotient might be a contractible space, and Morse functions on it with three critical points. But how many topologically distinct ways can you arrange three critical points in R^8? Depending on their indices, there might be multiple possibilities.\n\nFor example, if the three critical points have indices 0, 4, and 8 (assuming you can have a maximum in a non-compact space), but R^8 doesn't have a maximum unless the function is proper and the maximum is at infinity. Alternatively, the function could have a local maximum, but in R^8, such a maximum would not be a global maximum.\n\nAlternatively, if all three critical points are minima (index 0), but then the function would have three local minima. But in R^8, you can have multiple minima, but they would be topologically equivalent if the minima are connected by paths that don't pass through other critical points. But since R^8 is simply connected, maybe all such configurations are equivalent. But with three minima, you could have them arranged differently, but in R^8, any two points are homeomorphic via translations, so the number of distinct configurations might be related to the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is determined by the possible distinct configurations of indices. For example, if we have three critical values, each associated with critical points of a certain index. Suppose we have one critical value with index 0, one with index 4, and one with index 8. If such a function exists, it's one type. If you have another combination, like 0, 1, 2, that's another type. The number of possible unordered combinations of three distinct indices from 0 to 8. But since the order of critical values (as real numbers) matters, but the topological equivalence could reverse the order via a homeomorphism that reverses the real line. Wait, but the critical values are ordered, so the function's topology would depend on the order of indices. For example, a function with a minimum, a saddle, and then a higher saddle would be different from one that goes minimum, higher saddle, lower saddle. But since R^8 is contractible, maybe you can always reverse the order via a homeomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, the indices must form a sequence that's compatible with the handle attachments. For Morse functions, handles are attached in the order of increasing critical values. So the topology of the manifold is built by attaching handles in the order of the critical points. In R^8, starting from the empty set, attaching a 0-handle (a disk), then higher handles. But for R^8, which is contractible, the handles must cancel each other out. For example, a 0-handle and an 8-handle can cancel, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut this is getting too deep into Morse theory specifics without knowing the exact structure of the quotient space. Since I'm stuck, maybe I should consider that the answer is 1, thinking that the quotient space's topology only allows one such Morse function up to equivalence. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the number of topologically distinct Morse functions on a manifold with three critical points (assuming three critical points with three critical values) depends on the possible handle decompositions. For a simply connected manifold, like S^8, it would require certain conditions. But R^8 is contractible, so maybe any Morse function with three critical points must have indices that allow the space to be built from those handles. For example, starting with a 0-handle (a disk), then attaching a k-handle, then an 8-handle. But attaching an 8-handle to R^8 would require some gluing, which might not be possible. Hence, such a Morse function might not exist unless the handles can be canceled.\n\nBut this is getting too involved. Since I don't recall the exact result, and given that the question is about E8's quotient, which is R^8, and the number of distinct Morse functions with three critical values, perhaps the answer is 4. This is because in some sources, the number of possible distinct Morse functions for certain algebraic varieties can relate to their Dynkin diagram's properties. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 3. But why? If there's one critical point of each of three different indices, for example, and there are three possible index configurations that are allowed. But in 8 dimensions, there are many possible index triplets.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to recall or derive the precise answer, and considering this is about the E8 quotient, which is a well-known object in mathematics, perhaps the answer is a known number. After some quick searching in my mind, I remember that the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with three critical values on the E8 quotient is 4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the quotient space E8/W is homeomorphic to R^8. The number of Morse functions on R^8 with three critical values is infinite, but if we consider up to topological equivalence (homeomorphism of R^8 preserving critical values), then the distinct classes would correspond to the possible configurations of critical points. However, in R^8, any two critical points of the same index can be moved around by homeomorphisms, so the number of distinct Morse functions would correspond to the number of distinct assignments of indices to the three critical values. Since the critical values are ordered, the indices must be assigned in a way respecting the order. Wait, but Morse functions can have critical points in any order. However, for topological equivalence, you can have any permutation of critical values via homeomorphism. But since Morse functions depend on the order of critical values, changing the order would require adjusting the function, which might not be possible via a homeomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be the number of subsets of the set {0,1,...,8} of size three, which is 84, but that seems too high. Alternatively, the number of possible sequences of indices where each subsequent index is greater than the previous (due to handle attachments), but without canceling handles. For R^8, which is built by attaching handles, the handle decomposition must be such that after attaching all handles, the space is R^8. For example, start with a 0-handle, then attach a 1-handle, then a 2-handle, etc., but in such a way that each handle cancels the previous one. However, having three handles with certain indices that allow this.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Given the time I've spent and not making progress, I'll hazard a guess that the answer is 4, maybe related to the four different possible index sequences that can produce R^8. So with three critical points, perhaps there are four different ways. But I'm really not confident. Alternatively, the answer might be 2, considering whether the middle critical point has an even or odd index. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: The E8 root system's Weyl group has an order of 696729600, which is a huge number, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, I'll go with the answer that I've seen in similar contexts. Sometimes, the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with three critical values for E8 is considered to be 4. But honestly, I'm not sure. However, to give a definitive answer, I'll choose 4 as the answer, with low confidence.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The question concerns the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with exactly three critical values on the quotient of the E8 root system by its Weyl group.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many topologically distinct Morse functions exist with exactly three critical values for the E8 root system when considered on the quotient by the Weyl group. Hmm, let's start by recalling some concepts.\n\nFirst, the E8 root system is a complex structure with 240 roots, and it's related to Lie algebras. The Weyl group here is the symmetry group associated with E8. When we take the quotient by the Weyl group, we're essentially looking at the orbit space where each point is an orbit under the Weyl group action. So the quotient space should have some specific topological structure.\n\nMorse functions are smooth functions where critical points are non-degenerate and have distinct critical values. A Morse function with exactly three critical values would have minima, saddles, and maxima, but here the number of critical values is three. Wait, normally, Morse functions on a manifold can have multiple critical points, but critical values are the function's values at those points. If there are three critical values, then all critical points are mapped to three distinct values.\n\nBut the question is about topologically distinct Morse functions. Topological distinctness here probably means that the functions are not related by homeomorphisms of the underlying space. So two Morse functions are equivalent if there's a homeomorphism of the quotient space that maps the critical points of one to those of the other while preserving the critical values.\n\nNow, the quotient space for the E8 root system under the Weyl group. I remember that for a root system, the quotient of the Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group is isomorphic to affine space, or maybe a certain algebraic variety. Wait, in the case of E8, the Weyl group acts on the Cartan subalgebra, and the quotient space is a complex algebraic variety. But more importantly, topologically, what is this quotient? For example, in the case of SU(2), the quotient by the Weyl group (which is the symmetric group on two elements) might give a simpler space, but E8 is much more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quotient space here is a simplex or some polytope? Because Weyl groups often act as reflection groups, and their fundamental domains are simplices. So the quotient space could be a simplex. For example, in type A_n, the Weyl group is the symmetric group S_{n+1}, and the quotient of the Cartan subalgebra (which is a torus) might lead to a simplex as the fundamental domain. But for E8, the fundamental domain is a simplex of 8 dimensions? Or maybe another shape.\n\nWait, but the key point is the topology of the quotient space. If the quotient is a simplex, then topologically it's a disk. But Morse functions on a disk with three critical values. Let's think: For a compact manifold, the number of critical points of a Morse function relates to its topology via Morse inequalities. But here, the quotient might be a compact space. However, the exact structure is crucial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quotient space is a simply connected space. For E8, which is simply laced, perhaps the quotient is a sphere? But that seems unlikely. Maybe it's a more complex space. Alternatively, maybe the quotient is homeomorphic to a certain stratified space.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with three critical values on a given manifold relates to the possible ways to decompose the manifold into handles corresponding to the critical points. Each critical point of index k corresponds to a k-handle. However, when considering critical values, having three critical values would mean that all critical points with the lowest critical value are minima (index 0), then the next value could have critical points of higher index, and the highest value would have maxima (index n for an n-dimensional manifold). But how does this split when we have three critical values?\n\nWait, but the problem is specifically about the quotient by the Weyl group. Maybe this quotient space has a particular cell structure. For instance, in the case of ADE root systems, the quotient spaces might have cell decompositions related to the Coxeter complex. The number of cells in each dimension could influence the possible Morse functions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the Weyl group acts as a reflection group, and the quotient space could be a fundamental chamber. The fundamental chamber for E8 is an 8-dimensional simplex. If the quotient space is homeomorphic to this simplex, then Morse functions on the simplex with three critical values. But a simplex is a convex polytope, which is contractible, so its topology is trivial. However, Morse functions on a simplex could have critical points at vertices, edges, etc.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is more algebraic. The number of topologically distinct Morse functions might relate to the number of orbits under some group action or the structure of the poset of critical points. Alternatively, in the context of singularity theory, maybe this is related to the number of possible Cerf decompositions or something else.\n\nWait, I recall that in the study of hyperplane arrangements, the number of possible Morse functions or combinatorial types might relate to the number of regions or chambers. But here, for the quotient by the Weyl group, the arrangement would be the Coxeter arrangement, and the chambers are the Weyl chambers. But perhaps the quotient collapses all chambers into one, so the quotient is the fundamental chamber.\n\nAlternatively, there's a result by someone (maybe Brieskorn or Slodowy) regarding singularities related to root systems. The quotient of the Cartan subalgebra by the Weyl group for E8 is known to be a singularity of type E8, which is a hypersurface singularity in C^8. However, the topology of this quotient might be more involved.\n\nBut perhaps this is a question related to the number of conjugacy classes or something else. Wait, no. The question is about Morse functions on the quotient space with three critical values. Each Morse function's critical points must lie in different orbits, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, since the Weyl group quotient is an orbifold, maybe we need to consider Morse functions on orbifolds. But I'm not sure how that affects the count.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Dynkin diagram of E8, which has certain nodes. The number of distinct Morse functions might correspond to the number of ways to color the nodes or some combinatorial structure. For example, assigning critical values to nodes in the Dynkin diagram, but that seems vague.\n\nWait, another angle: the quotient space for E8 under the Weyl group is an 8-dimensional space, and a Morse function on it would have critical points of various indices. But with three critical values, perhaps these correspond to the minimum, a saddle, and the maximum. But how does that split in 8 dimensions? Wait, in n-dimensional manifold, you can have critical points of index 0 to n. But if you have three critical values, you might group critical points of different indices under the same critical value. But for topological distinctness, the arrangement of these critical points and their indices matter.\n\nBut perhaps in this specific case, due to the structure of the E8 quotient, the number of such Morse functions is determined by the number of vertices in some graph or poset related to the root system. Alternatively, maybe each Morse function corresponds to a choice of a subset of the roots with certain properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a known result in Lie theory. Let me think. For example, in the study of Coxeter groups and their geometric representations, the number of conjugacy classes of elements or reflection subgroups might play a role. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a thought. The quotient space for E8 by its Weyl group is an affine variety, and the number of critical points of a Morse function on it relates to its singularities. But since we are considering Morse functions with three critical values, perhaps this corresponds to the simple singularities classification. However, E8 is already a simple singularity, so maybe the number of Morse functions here corresponds to the Milnor number or something else. But the Milnor number for E8 is 8, which counts the number of vanishing cycles. Not sure if that's related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a question about the number of W-orbits in some set. But if the quotient is taken, then points in the quotient correspond to W-orbits. So a Morse function on the quotient would be a function that is invariant under W, hence descending from a W-invariant function on the original space. But the critical points of such a function would correspond to critical orbits. So the number of critical orbits is three.\n\nBut the problem says \"exactly three critical values\", so each critical orbit is assigned a distinct critical value, but multiple critical orbits can have the same critical value. Wait no, if the function is on the quotient space, then each point in the quotient is an orbit, so each critical point in the quotient is a single critical orbit. So having exactly three critical values would mean there are three critical orbits in the original space, each assigned a distinct value. But topological distinctness would require that the configuration of these orbits can't be transformed into each other via homeomorphism.\n\nBut perhaps for the E8 quotient, the number of such Morse functions is related to the number of vertices, edges, and higher-dimensional cells in some decomposition. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula from combinatorics.\n\nWait, I recall that in some cases, the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with a certain number of critical points can be determined by the number of possible ways to attach handles. But without knowing the specific topology of the quotient space, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is related to the Coxeter number of E8. The Coxeter number for E8 is 30. But I don't see a direct connection here.\n\nWait, maybe the number is 3, 4, or some small number. But why? If the quotient space is simply connected and has a certain homology, perhaps the number is determined by the Betti numbers. But for example, if the quotient is a sphere, then a Morse function with three critical points would be the minimum, the maximum, and one saddle. But a sphere in n dimensions has a standard Morse function with two critical points. Wait, no\u2014on an n-sphere, the standard height function has two critical points: min and max. So if someone has three critical values, there must be at least three critical points. So maybe the quotient space is not a sphere.\n\nAlternatively, if the quotient is a space with a more complex topology. For E8, perhaps the quotient has a Betti number that allows for three critical points. But I don't know the Betti numbers of the quotient space.\n\nAlternatively, this might be a trick question. Maybe the number is 1, because there's only one such Morse function up to topological equivalence. But why?\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in the context of the ADE classification, certain invariants correspond to the number of vertices minus one, or other combinatorial data, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be 4, as in E8's rank is 8, but that's just a guess. Wait, perhaps the number relates to the exponents of the Weyl group. The exponents of E8 are 1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29. The number of exponents is 8, but again, I don't see the connection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number is given by the number of nilpotent orbits with three parts in their Jordan decomposition. But that's in representation theory.\n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal number of critical points. For the quotient space, if it's a 8-dimensional manifold (which I doubt, as quotient by a Weyl group often results in singular spaces unless we take the smooth part), but if it's an orbifold, Morse theory still applies in some sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2. Because maybe there's two distinct ways to assign the critical values. But this is pure speculation.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might reference the fact that the E8 quotient has a certain stratification, and the number of topologically distinct Morse functions corresponds to the number of strata of a certain dimension. But without knowing the exact stratification, this is hard.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. In the paper \"Morse functions on symmetric spaces and the classical groups\" by someone, maybe there's a result. Alternatively, in the case of the quotient by the Weyl group, the invariant polynomials are generated by fundamental degrees. For E8, the algebra of invariant polynomials is a polynomial algebra generated by homogeneous polynomials of degrees 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30. These are the exponents plus one.\n\nBut Morse functions are related to functions with non-degenerate critical points. If we take a function on the quotient, which is the spectrum of the invariant polynomials, which is an affine space. The quotient space is the base space of the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem, which states that the quotient is smooth if and only if the group is generated by reflections, which it is for Weyl groups. Wait, no\u2014the quotient of a vector space by a finite reflection group is isomorphic to an affine space. So the quotient for E8's Weyl group acting on the Cartan subalgebra is an affine space of dimension 8, which is just C^8. Wait, but topologically, C^8 is contractible, so as a manifold it's trivial. But Morse functions on contractible spaces can't have maxima unless you compactify it. Wait, but the original Cartan subalgebra is a real vector space, right? So the Weyl group acts on a real vector space h, which is the Cartan subalgebra. The quotient h/W is isomorphic to R^8, since the Weyl group is a finite reflection group. By Chevalley's theorem, the ring of invariant polynomials is a polynomial ring, so the quotient is indeed an affine space. So the quotient space is homeomorphic to R^8.\n\nBut Morse functions on R^8 with three critical values. But R^8 is non-compact. However, maybe the question is considering a compactification or the function is proper. Wait, but Morse functions on non-compact manifolds can have infinitely many critical points. However, the problem specifies exactly three critical values. That would require that there are three critical points (each with a distinct value), but on R^8, you can have such functions. For example, a function with a minimum, a saddle, and another saddle, but in higher dimensions. However, in that case, the topology of the function's critical points would depend on their indices. But the problem says \"topologically distinct\", which in this context would mean that the functions are not related by homeomorphisms of the quotient space (which is R^8) preserving the critical points.\n\nBut in R^8, any two Morse functions with three critical points (say, one minimum, one saddle, and another saddle of different index) could be homeomorphic if their critical points can be mapped to each other. However, the indices of the critical points affect the topological type. For instance, a function with a minimum (index 0), a critical point of index 1, and another of index 2 would be different from one with indices 0, 3, and 5. But the problem states \"three critical values\", so three distinct critical points. Wait, but each critical value can correspond to multiple critical points. Wait, no. Each critical value is the value of the function at a critical point. So if we have three critical values, then each critical point has its own value, or multiple critical points share a value. Wait, the problem says \"exactly three critical values\". So all critical points are mapped to three distinct values. For example, one critical value could correspond to several critical points (all with the same value). But Morse functions typically have distinct critical values for each critical point. Unless you allow for multiple critical points with the same value, but the problem says \"exactly three critical values\", implying that all critical points are mapped to three values. However, the count of critical points per value is not specified. Wait, but Morse functions usually have distinct critical values. However, the problem seems to allow multiple critical points per value, but only three different values.\n\nBut in standard Morse theory, functions are often assumed to have distinct critical values (for ease), but the problem here allows three values. So for instance, the function could have several critical points at the first value, several at the second, and several at the third. Then the question is about the number of topologically distinct such functions.\n\nHowever, the E8 quotient space is R^8, which is contractible. So any Morse function on R^8 with three critical values must have critical points that are, say, a minimum, a saddle, and another saddle. But in R^8, the minimal number of critical points for a Morse function is one (a minimum, for instance). But adding more critical points would involve having functions that perhaps have a min, then some saddles. However, precisely, in R^n, you can have Morse functions with any number of critical points.\n\nBut how does the topology of the quotient space (R^8) affect the number of topologically distinct Morse functions? If the space is homeomorphic to R^8, then all such Morse functions are determined by the number and indices of their critical points. However, for two Morse functions to be topologically equivalent, there must exist a homeomorphism of R^8 that maps the critical points of one to those of the other and preserves the critical values.\n\nSo suppose we have a Morse function on R^8 with three critical values, each corresponding to a single critical point. Then the indices of these critical points could vary. For example, one could have a minimum (index 0), a saddle (index k), and another saddle (index m). The distinctness would depend on the indices. Alternatively, if there are multiple critical points per critical value, their configuration in space would matter.\n\nBut the problem states \"topologically distinct Morse functions with exactly three critical values\". So if two such functions have critical points arranged in a way that can be mapped to each other via a homeomorphism, they are equivalent. So for R^8, the classification would depend on the configuration of the critical points and their indices.\n\nHowever, in R^n, the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with given critical points is determined by the indices and the possible ways to \"embed\" them into the space. For example, in R^2, a function with a min, a saddle, and a max would be distinct from one with two minima and a saddle if the indices or the order differ. But in higher dimensions, it's more complicated.\n\nBut for R^8, which is contractible, the possible Morse functions with three critical values would be classified by the indices of the critical points. Each critical value can correspond to multiple critical points of different indices, but since we have three critical values, maybe each value corresponds to critical points of the same index.\n\nWait, but perhaps the answer is determined by the number of possible combinations of indices allowed for critical points in such a function. For example, in R^8, if we have three critical points with indices 0, 4, and 8, that could be a possibility. Or another combination. Each combination would give a different topological type.\n\nBut since the function is on R^8, which is contractible, the existence of a maximum (index 8) is impossible unless the function is proper and the maximum is at infinity. But Morse functions on non-compact manifolds may not have maxima. Hmm. Wait, but in R^8, a Morse function can have local maxima, but they aren't global maxima because the function can go to infinity. But if we require the function to be proper (so that preimages of compact sets are compact), then maybe, but the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps the critical points could be of any index.\n\nBut in that case, how many topologically distinct Morse functions are there? For each possible distribution of indices among three critical points, we could have a different topological type. For example:\n\n1. Index 0, 1, 2\n2. Index 0, 1, 3\n3. etc.\n\nBut since the order of the critical values matters (i.e., which index is assigned to which critical value), but topological equivalence would allow reordering via homeomorphism. Wait, no. The critical values are real numbers, so they have an order. So the Morse function can't have higher critical values assigned to lower indices in a way that's incompatible with their positions. But in R^8, you could have the critical points arranged along a line, so their critical values are ordered. If two functions have their critical points ordered differently, but the indices are the same, they might still be equivalent if you can permute them via a homeomorphism. But in R^8, homeomorphisms can be quite flexible, but permuting critical points would require that their stable and unstable manifolds don't interfere.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe there's a standard result here. Considering that the question is about the E8 root system quotient by the Weyl group, which is R^8, and we're to count topologically distinct Morse functions with three critical values. But I don't recall a specific number here. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is related to the number of vertices in the E8 Dynkin diagram, which is 8, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, the number of simple roots, which is 8 for E8. Still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking for known results. I recall that in the study of singularities, the E8 singularity has Milnor number 8, but again, not sure. If the quotient space has an E8 singularity, maybe the number of Morse functions is related to the Milnor number. But the Milnor number counts the number of vanishing cycles, not directly Morse functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 3. Because the three critical values correspond to the three conjugacy classes of some subgroups. But I don't know the conjugacy classes of the E8 Weyl group. The number of conjugacy classes for E8's Weyl group is 112, but that's too large.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 1. If all such Morse functions are equivalent under the homeomorphism group of the quotient space. But I doubt that. If the quotient is R^8, then homeomorphisms are flexible, but critical points with different indices would not be equivalent.\n\nWait, suppose we have three critical points with indices 0,1,2. Can a homeomorphism of R^8 rearrange their positions? Yes, but since their indices are different, they are topologically distinct. So each distinct set of indices would give a different topological type. However, the problem says \"exactly three critical values\", which could correspond to any number of critical points, but each assigned to one of three values. Wait, but Morse functions typically have each critical point with a distinct critical value, but if the problem allows multiple critical points at the same value, then you can have more critical points. However, in that case, their indices must be the same, because a small perturbation would split them into distinct critical values if their indices differ. Wait, no. If two critical points have the same index and are in different locations, a small perturbation can separate their critical values. But if they have different indices, they can still be at the same value. But in Morse theory, the Morse function is chosen so that each critical point has a distinct critical value. So if the problem allows for three critical values, each of which may have several critical points, but all with the same index? For example, three critical values, each with one or more critical points. But topological distinctness would then depend on the number and indices of critical points at each value.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Since I don't have the specific knowledge, I might need to make an educated guess. Given that the E8 root system's quotient by the Weyl group is R^8, and we're looking for Morse functions with three critical values, I need to see if there's a standard count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a question related to the real locus of the quotient. For example, the real quotient might be a contractible space, and Morse functions on it with three critical points. But how many topologically distinct ways can you arrange three critical points in R^8? Depending on their indices, there might be multiple possibilities.\n\nFor example, if the three critical points have indices 0, 4, and 8 (assuming you can have a maximum in a non-compact space), but R^8 doesn't have a maximum unless the function is proper and the maximum is at infinity. Alternatively, the function could have a local maximum, but in R^8, such a maximum would not be a global maximum.\n\nAlternatively, if all three critical points are minima (index 0), but then the function would have three local minima. But in R^8, you can have multiple minima, but they would be topologically equivalent if the minima are connected by paths that don't pass through other critical points. But since R^8 is simply connected, maybe all such configurations are equivalent. But with three minima, you could have them arranged differently, but in R^8, any two points are homeomorphic via translations, so the number of distinct configurations might be related to the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is determined by the possible distinct configurations of indices. For example, if we have three critical values, each associated with critical points of a certain index. Suppose we have one critical value with index 0, one with index 4, and one with index 8. If such a function exists, it's one type. If you have another combination, like 0, 1, 2, that's another type. The number of possible unordered combinations of three distinct indices from 0 to 8. But since the order of critical values (as real numbers) matters, but the topological equivalence could reverse the order via a homeomorphism that reverses the real line. Wait, but the critical values are ordered, so the function's topology would depend on the order of indices. For example, a function with a minimum, a saddle, and then a higher saddle would be different from one that goes minimum, higher saddle, lower saddle. But since R^8 is contractible, maybe you can always reverse the order via a homeomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, the indices must form a sequence that's compatible with the handle attachments. For Morse functions, handles are attached in the order of increasing critical values. So the topology of the manifold is built by attaching handles in the order of the critical points. In R^8, starting from the empty set, attaching a 0-handle (a disk), then higher handles. But for R^8, which is contractible, the handles must cancel each other out. For example, a 0-handle and an 8-handle can cancel, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut this is getting too deep into Morse theory specifics without knowing the exact structure of the quotient space. Since I'm stuck, maybe I should consider that the answer is 1, thinking that the quotient space's topology only allows one such Morse function up to equivalence. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the number of topologically distinct Morse functions on a manifold with three critical points (assuming three critical points with three critical values) depends on the possible handle decompositions. For a simply connected manifold, like S^8, it would require certain conditions. But R^8 is contractible, so maybe any Morse function with three critical points must have indices that allow the space to be built from those handles. For example, starting with a 0-handle (a disk), then attaching a k-handle, then an 8-handle. But attaching an 8-handle to R^8 would require some gluing, which might not be possible. Hence, such a Morse function might not exist unless the handles can be canceled.\n\nBut this is getting too involved. Since I don't recall the exact result, and given that the question is about E8's quotient, which is R^8, and the number of distinct Morse functions with three critical values, perhaps the answer is 4. This is because in some sources, the number of possible distinct Morse functions for certain algebraic varieties can relate to their Dynkin diagram's properties. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 3. But why? If there's one critical point of each of three different indices, for example, and there are three possible index configurations that are allowed. But in 8 dimensions, there are many possible index triplets.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to recall or derive the precise answer, and considering this is about the E8 quotient, which is a well-known object in mathematics, perhaps the answer is a known number. After some quick searching in my mind, I remember that the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with three critical values on the E8 quotient is 4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the quotient space E8/W is homeomorphic to R^8. The number of Morse functions on R^8 with three critical values is infinite, but if we consider up to topological equivalence (homeomorphism of R^8 preserving critical values), then the distinct classes would correspond to the possible configurations of critical points. However, in R^8, any two critical points of the same index can be moved around by homeomorphisms, so the number of distinct Morse functions would correspond to the number of distinct assignments of indices to the three critical values. Since the critical values are ordered, the indices must be assigned in a way respecting the order. Wait, but Morse functions can have critical points in any order. However, for topological equivalence, you can have any permutation of critical values via homeomorphism. But since Morse functions depend on the order of critical values, changing the order would require adjusting the function, which might not be possible via a homeomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be the number of subsets of the set {0,1,...,8} of size three, which is 84, but that seems too high. Alternatively, the number of possible sequences of indices where each subsequent index is greater than the previous (due to handle attachments), but without canceling handles. For R^8, which is built by attaching handles, the handle decomposition must be such that after attaching all handles, the space is R^8. For example, start with a 0-handle, then attach a 1-handle, then a 2-handle, etc., but in such a way that each handle cancels the previous one. However, having three handles with certain indices that allow this.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Given the time I've spent and not making progress, I'll hazard a guess that the answer is 4, maybe related to the four different possible index sequences that can produce R^8. So with three critical points, perhaps there are four different ways. But I'm really not confident. Alternatively, the answer might be 2, considering whether the middle critical point has an even or odd index. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: The E8 root system's Weyl group has an order of 696729600, which is a huge number, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nGiven all this uncertainty, I'll go with the answer that I've seen in similar contexts. Sometimes, the number of topologically distinct Morse functions with three critical values for E8 is considered to be 4. But honestly, I'm not sure. However, to give a definitive answer, I'll choose 4 as the answer, with low confidence.",
