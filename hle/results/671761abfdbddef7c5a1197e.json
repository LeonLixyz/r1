  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about finding for which values of \u03bb the given integral equation has no solutions. The equation is u(x) = 1 + \u03bb \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y) u(y) dy, for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some integral equation theory. This looks like a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, right? The general form is u(x) = f(x) + \u03bb \u222b K(x,y)u(y) dy. Here, f(x) is 1, and the kernel K(x,y) is (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). \n\nI remember that for these equations, solutions exist except when \u03bb is the reciprocal of the eigenvalues of the kernel. So, the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the kernel. So, to find the \u03bb where there's no solution, we need to find the eigenvalues of the integral operator with this kernel and then take \u03bb to be the reciprocals. But wait, actually, in the standard Fredholm equation, the homogeneous equation (when f=0) has non-trivial solutions when \u03bb is an eigenvalue. So for the non-homogeneous equation (f not zero), if \u03bb is equal to an eigenvalue, then the solution might not exist unless certain conditions are met (like the Fredholm alternative). But the question here is when does the equation have no solutions. So, maybe when \u03bb is equal to an eigenvalue of the kernel, then the equation might not have a solution unless the right-hand side is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator. But since the right-hand side here is 1, which might not satisfy that orthogonality condition, so in those cases, when \u03bb is an eigenvalue, there are no solutions.\n\nTherefore, the values of \u03bb where the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel? Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. Wait, in the standard equation u = f + \u03bb Ku, the existence of solutions depends on \u03bb not being equal to the reciprocal of the eigenvalues. Wait, actually, the homogeneous equation Ku = \u03bc u has eigenvalues \u03bc. Then, the integral equation u = f + \u03bb Ku is equivalent to (I - \u03bb K)u = f. So, if 1/\u03bb is not an eigenvalue of K, then the operator (I - \u03bb K) is invertible, and there's a unique solution. If 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of K, then the operator is not invertible, so the equation might not have a solution unless f is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator. Therefore, the values of \u03bb where the equation has no solutions are those \u03bb such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of K and f is not orthogonal to the null space of (I - \u03bb K)*. \n\nIn this problem, f is 1, which might not be orthogonal to the eigenfunctions if \u03bb is such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue. Therefore, the answer is that the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of the eigenvalues of the kernel K. So the problem reduces to finding the eigenvalues of the kernel K(x,y) = (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). \n\nWait, let's compute the kernel. Let me simplify (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). That's the sum x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} y + ... + y^{n-1}, right? Because x\u207f - y\u207f = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} y + ... + y^{n-1}). So the kernel is actually K(x,y) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} y^{k}. \n\nHmm, so K(x,y) is a finite rank kernel, as it's a sum of separable terms. The integral operator with such a kernel is of finite rank, meaning it has a finite number of non-zero eigenvalues. Therefore, the eigenvalues can be found by considering the integral equation Ku = \u03bc u, where \u03bc is an eigenvalue. Let's write that out: \u03bc u(x) = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 K(x,y)u(y) dy. Substituting K(x,y) as the sum, we get \u03bc u(x) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{k} u(y) dy. Let's denote the integral \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^k u(y) dy as a_k. Then, the equation becomes \u03bc u(x) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^{n-1 -k}. Therefore, u(x) must be a linear combination of the functions x^{n-1 -k} for k=0,\u2026,n-1}, which are x^{n-1}, x^{n-2}, ..., x^0=1. Therefore, u(x) is a polynomial of degree at most n-1. \n\nSo, the eigenfunctions are polynomials of degree up to n-1, and the eigenvalues can be found by substituting u(x) as a linear combination of these basis functions. Let's consider a basis {1, x, x^2, ..., x^{n-1}} for the space of polynomials of degree \u2264n-1. Let's compute the operator K acting on each basis element. For example, take u_m(y) = y^m, where m is from 0 to n-1. Then, Ku_m(x) = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 K(x,y) y^m dy = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 [\u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} y^{k}] y^m dy = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{k + m} dy. The integral is 1/(k + m +1) when k + m +1 is evaluated from 0 to1. So, each term is x^{n-1 -k} / (k + m +1). Therefore, Ku_m(x) is a sum of terms involving x^{n-1 -k} multiplied by constants. \n\nBut since the operator K maps the basis functions into the space spanned by {x^{n-1}, x^{n-2}, ..., 1}, which is the same as the original basis. So, the operator K can be represented as a matrix in this basis, and the eigenvalues \u03bc are the eigenvalues of this matrix. Then, the eigenvalues \u03bb of the original integral equation would correspond to the reciprocals of these \u03bc's. \n\nHowever, this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the kernel is K(x,y) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} y^k, then K(x,y) is a degenerate (finite rank) kernel, and the integral equation can be rewritten as:\n\nu(x) = 1 + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^k u(y) dy.\n\nLet me denote the integrals as c_k = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^k u(y) dy. Then the equation becomes:\n\nu(x) = 1 + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} c_{k} x^{n-1 -k}.\n\nBut u(x) is expressed in terms of the coefficients c_k, which are integrals of y^k times u(y). Let's substitute this expression into the definition of c_m:\n\nc_m = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^m u(y) dy = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^m [1 + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1 -k}] dy.\n\nExpanding this:\n\nc_m = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^m dy + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^m y^{n-1 -k} dy.\n\nCompute the integrals:\n\nFirst term: \u222b y^m dy from 0 to1 is 1/(m+1).\n\nSecond term: the integral becomes \u222b y^{m + n -1 -k} dy = 1/(m + n -k) if m + n -k \u2265 0. Since k ranges from 0 to n-1, m is from 0 to n-1. Let me check m + n -k. Since k \u2264n-1, m \u22650, then m +n -k \u22650 +n - (n-1) =1, so always positive. So the integral is 1/(m +n -k +1)? Wait, no. Wait, the integral of y^p from 0 to1 is 1/(p+1). So, the exponent here is m +n -1 -k. Wait, m +n -1 -k +1 = m +n -k. Wait, no. The integral is \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{p} dy = 1/(p +1), where p = m + (n-1 -k) ? Wait, in the term: y^m multiplied by y^{n-1 -k} is y^{m + n -1 -k}. So the integral is \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{m +n -1 -k} dy = 1/(m +n -k) ), as the exponent is s = m +n -1 -k. Then, 1/(s+1) = 1/(m + n -k). \n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nc_m = 1/(m+1) + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k * [1/(m +n -k)].\n\nSo, this gives a system of linear equations for the coefficients c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}.\n\nLet's define the matrix equation. Let\u2019s arrange the equations for m =0,1,...,n-1:\n\nFor each m, the equation is:\n\nc_m - \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} [1/(m +n -k)] c_k = 1/(m+1).\n\nLet me write this in matrix form:\n\nLet A be an n x n matrix where the entry A_{m,k} = 1/(m +n -k). Then the system is:\n\n(I - \u03bb A^T) c = b,\n\nwhere c is the vector [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}], and b is the vector [1/(0+1), 1/(1+1), ..., 1/(n-1 +1)] = [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n].\n\nWait, wait. Wait the equation is:\n\nc_m = 1/(m+1) + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} [1/(m +n -k)] c_k.\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nc_m - \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} [1/(m +n -k)] c_k = 1/(m+1).\n\nTherefore, the system is (I - \u03bb A) c = b, where A_{m,k} = 1/(m +n -k). Wait, m and k go from 0 to n-1. Let's check for specific m and k. For example, m=0, k=0: A_{0,0}=1/(0 +n -0) =1/n. For m=0, k=1: 1/(0 +n -1)=1/(n-1). Similarly, m=1, k=0: 1/(1 +n -0)=1/(n+1). Hmm, seems that the entries vary.\n\nThe solvability of the system (I - \u03bb A)c = b depends on the determinant of (I - \u03bb A). If the determinant is non-zero, then there is a unique solution. If the determinant is zero, then the system may have no solution or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether b is in the image of (I - \u03bb A). \n\nTherefore, the values of \u03bb for which the equation has no solution are those \u03bb where 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the matrix A and the vector b is not orthogonal to the nullspace of (I - \u03bb A)^* (by the Fredholm alternative). However, calculating this for a general n might be complex. However, perhaps there's a pattern or a simpler way to find the eigenvalues of A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can notice that the kernel K(x,y) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} y^k is related to the outer product of the vectors [x^{n-1}, x^{n-2}, ..., 1] and [1, y, ..., y^{n-1}]. Therefore, the matrix A might have a particular structure. Alternatively, perhaps the operator is of rank n, and the eigenvalues can be calculated through the matrix.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think of a specific case. Suppose n=1. Then K(x,y) = (x^1 - y^1)/(x - y) =1. So the kernel is 1. Then the equation becomes u(x) =1 + \u03bb \u222b\u2080\u00b9 1 * u(y) dy. So u(x) =1 + \u03bb C, where C = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 u(y) dy. Then, integrating both sides from 0 to1, we get C=1 + \u03bb C *1. So C=1 + \u03bb C. Therefore, solving for C: C - \u03bb C =1 => C(1 - \u03bb)=1. So C=1/(1 - \u03bb). Therefore, u(x)=1 + \u03bb/(1 - \u03bb) =1/(1 - \u03bb). But this requires that \u03bb \u22601. If \u03bb=1, then the equation becomes C=1 + C, which implies 0=1, which is impossible, so no solution. Therefore, for n=1, the equation has no solution when \u03bb=1. \n\nSimilarly, let's take n=2. Then K(x,y) = (x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)/(x - y) =x + y. So the kernel is x + y. The integral equation is u(x) =1 + \u03bb \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x + y)u(y) dy. Let's compute the integral: \u222b(x + y)u(y) dy = x \u222bu(y) dy + \u222b y u(y) dy. Let\u2019s denote C1=\u222bu(y) dy and C2=\u222by u(y) dy. Then the equation becomes u(x) =1 + \u03bb (x C1 + C2). Substitute this into the definitions of C1 and C2:\n\nC1 = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 [1 + \u03bb (x C1 + C2)] dx = \u222b1 dx + \u03bb C1 \u222bx dx + \u03bb C2 \u222b dx. \n\nCompute each integral:\n\n\u222b1 dx from 0 to1 =1.\n\n\u222bx dx =1/2.\n\n\u222bdx from 0 to1 =1.\n\nThus, C1 =1 + \u03bb C1*(1/2) + \u03bb C2*1.\n\nSimilarly, C2 = \u222b x [1 + \u03bb (x C1 + C2)] dx = \u222bx dx + \u03bb C1 \u222bx\u00b2 dx + \u03bb C2 \u222bx dx.\n\nCompute:\n\n\u222bx dx =1/2.\n\n\u222bx\u00b2 dx=1/3.\n\n\u222bx dx =1/2.\n\nSo, C2 =1/2 + \u03bb C1*(1/3) + \u03bb C2*(1/2).\n\nNow we have a system:\n\nC1 =1 + (\u03bb/2) C1 + \u03bb C2.\n\nC2 =1/2 + (\u03bb/3) C1 + (\u03bb/2) C2.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nC1 - (\u03bb/2) C1 - \u03bb C2 =1.\n\nC2 - (\u03bb/3) C1 - (\u03bb/2) C2 =1/2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nC1(1 - \u03bb/2) - \u03bb C2 =1.\n\n- (\u03bb/3) C1 + C2(1 - \u03bb/2) =1/2.\n\nThis is a linear system. Let's write in matrix form:\n\n[ (1 - \u03bb/2) , -\u03bb        ] [C1]   = [1]\n\n[ -\u03bb/3       , (1 - \u03bb/2) ] [C2]     [1/2]\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is:\n\nD = (1 - \u03bb/2)(1 - \u03bb/2) - ( -\u03bb)( -\u03bb/3 )\n\n= (1 - \u03bb + \u03bb\u00b2/4) - (\u03bb\u00b2 /3 )\n\n= 1 - \u03bb + (\u03bb\u00b2/4 - \u03bb\u00b2/3 )\n\n=1 - \u03bb + ( -\u03bb\u00b2/12 )\n\nSo D =1 - \u03bb - \u03bb\u00b2/12.\n\nFor the system to have a unique solution, D \u22600. If D=0, then the system may not have a solution or have infinitely many. So, the values of \u03bb that make D=0 are the ones where there's no solution or infinitely many. But since the non-homogeneous term is present, when D=0, the system may be inconsistent, leading to no solution. Thus, for n=2, the equation has no solution when 1 - \u03bb - \u03bb\u00b2/12 =0. Solving this quadratic equation: \u03bb\u00b2/12 +\u03bb -1=0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 +12\u03bb -12=0 \u2192 \u03bb=(-12 \u00b1 sqrt(144 +48))/2 = (-12 \u00b1 sqrt(192))/2 = (-12 \u00b1 8\u221a3)/2= -6 \u00b14\u221a3. So the roots are \u03bb= -6 +4\u221a3 \u2248 -6 +6.928\u22480.928, and \u03bb= -6 -4\u221a3\u2248-12.928. But since the integral equation is over [0,1], and the kernel is positive? Wait, but \u03bb can be any real number. But the question is for which \u03bb there's no solution. So for these two roots, the determinant is zero, and hence the equation might not have a solution. But we need to check whether the system is inconsistent for those \u03bb. \n\nAlternatively, maybe for all \u03bb such that D=0, the system is inconsistent. However, this depends on the specific values. But according to the Fredholm alternative, if \u03bb is such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the kernel, then the equation has a solution iff the right-hand side is orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint kernel. However, in this case, with n=2, the kernel is K(x,y)=x+y, which is symmetric, so the operator is self-adjoint. The eigenvalues \u03bc of K satisfy Ku=\u03bc u. So, solving \u03bc u(x)=\u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x + y)u(y) dy. Let's find the eigenvalues. Let\u2019s assume u(x) is a linear function, since the kernel is x + y, which is rank 2. So the eigenfunctions are of the form ax + b. Let's substitute:\n\n\u03bc (ax + b) = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x + y)(ay + b) dy.\n\nExpand the RHS:\n\n= x \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (ay + b) dy + \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y (ay + b) dy.\n\nCompute integrals:\n\nFirst integral: a \u222b y dy + b \u222b dy = a*(1/2) + b*1 = a/2 + b.\n\nSecond integral: a \u222b y\u00b2 dy + b \u222b y dy = a*(1/3) + b*(1/2).\n\nThus, RHS =x(a/2 + b) + (a/3 + b/2).\n\nTherefore, equate to LHS \u03bc(ax + b):\n\n\u03bc a x + \u03bc b = (a/2 + b) x + (a/3 + b/2).\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\nFor x term: \u03bc a = a/2 + b.\n\nConstant term: \u03bc b = a/3 + b/2.\n\nThis is a system of equations:\n\n\u03bc a - a/2 - b =0.\n\n- a/3 + \u03bc b - b/2 =0.\n\nTo find non-trivial solutions (a,b \u22600), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Arrange as:\n\n(\u03bc -1/2) a - b =0.\n\n(-1/3) a + (\u03bc -1/2) b =0.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n|(\u03bc -1/2)   -1          |\n\n| -1/3      (\u03bc -1/2)   |\n\n= (\u03bc -1/2)^2 - ( (-1)(-1/3) ) = (\u03bc -1/2)^2 -1/3.\n\nSet to zero:\n\n(\u03bc -1/2)^2 =1/3 \u2192 \u03bc -1/2=\u00b11/\u221a3 \u2192 \u03bc=1/2 \u00b11/\u221a3\u22480.5\u00b10.577. So \u03bc\u22481.077 or \u03bc\u2248-0.077. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of the kernel K are \u03bc=1/2 \u00b11/\u221a3. Thus, the eigenvalues \u03bb of the integral equation (where 1/\u03bb is the eigenvalues of K) are \u03bb=1/\u03bc. Therefore, the equation u=1 +\u03bb Ku has no solution when \u03bb=1/\u03bc. So \u03bb=1/(1/2 +1/\u221a3) and \u03bb=1/(1/2 -1/\u221a3). Simplifying:\n\nFirst eigenvalue: \u03bc1=1/2 +1/\u221a3 \u22481.077. Then \u03bb1=1/\u03bc1\u22480.928.\n\nSecond eigenvalue: \u03bc2=1/2 -1/\u221a3\u2248-0.077, so \u03bb2=1/\u03bc2\u2248-12.928.\n\nWhich matches the roots of the determinant D=0 for the system when n=2. Therefore, for these \u03bb values, the equation has no solution.\n\nSo generalizing, for any n, the values of \u03bb where the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel K(x,y). Since the kernel is of finite rank (n terms), there are n eigenvalues (including multiplicity), and thus there are n such \u03bb values (possibly complex, but since the kernel is real and symmetric when n is such that K is symmetric?), but wait, for general n, K(x,y)= (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y), which is symmetric only if n is even? Wait, no. Let me check. K(x,y) = x^{n-1} +x^{n-2} y + ... + y^{n-1}. So for example, n=2: K(x,y)=x + y, which is symmetric. n=3: K(x,y)=x\u00b2 + xy + y\u00b2, which is symmetric. For general n, K(x,y) is symmetric because swapping x and y gives K(y,x)=y^{n-1} + y^{n-2}x + ... +x^{n-1} = K(x,y). So the kernel is symmetric for any n. Therefore, the integral operator is self-adjoint, and its eigenvalues are real, and the eigenfunctions are orthogonal. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues \u03bc of K are real, and thus the values of \u03bb=1/\u03bc are also real. Therefore, the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of K.\n\nThus, the answer is that the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel K(x,y)=\u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1\u2212k} y^k. \n\nBut how to express this in terms of n? For example, when n=1, the kernel is K(x,y)=1, and the eigenvalue is \u03bc=1 (since \u222b\u2080\u00b91*1 dy=1, so the eigenvalue is 1). Hence, \u03bb=1 would be problematic, which matches the earlier case.\n\nFor general n, the eigenvalues \u03bc can be found by considering the integral operator's action on the basis functions. However, the exact eigenvalues depend on n. For example, when n=2, we found eigenvalues \u03bc=1/2 \u00b11/\u221a3. For general n, the eigenvalues would be solutions to the characteristic equation of the matrix A, but since A is an n x n matrix, this becomes complex. However, the question is asking for the answer in terms of \u03bb being the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of K, regardless of n. \n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern. Let's think of the kernel K(x,y)= (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x\u2212y)=x^{n\u22121}+x^{n\u22122} y+\u2026+y^{n\u22121}. Notice that for each fixed x, K(x,y) is a polynomial in y of degree n\u22121, and similarly for y. The integral operator K is a symmetric operator, and its eigenfunctions are polynomials of degree up to n\u22121. Therefore, the eigenvalues can be found by diagonalizing the matrix representation of K in the basis {1, x, x\u00b2, ..., x^{n\u22121}}. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a generating function approach or another method. For example, consider the integral operator K acting on x^k:\n\nK(x^k) = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 K(x,y) y^k dy = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x^{n\u22121} +x^{n\u22122} y + \u2026 + y^{n\u22121}) y^k dy = x^{n\u22121} \u222by^k dy + x^{n\u22122} \u222by^{k+1} dy + \u2026 + \u222b y^{k+n\u22121} dy.\n\nEach integral is 1/(k + m +1) for the terms x^{n\u22121\u2212m} \u222b y^{m +k} dy, where m ranges from 0 to n-1. Wait, no. Let's index the terms in K(x,y) as x^{n\u22121\u2212m} y^m for m from 0 to n\u22121. So:\n\nK(x,y) = \u03a3_{m=0}^{n\u22121} x^{n\u22121\u2212m} y^m.\n\nThus, K(x^k) = \u03a3_{m=0}^{n\u22121} x^{n\u22121\u2212m} \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{m +k} dy = \u03a3_{m=0}^{n\u22121} x^{n\u22121\u2212m} / (m +k +1).\n\nTherefore, when we express K in the basis {x^0, x^1, ..., x^{n\u22121}}, the matrix elements would be such that the entry for x^{n\u22121\u2212m} multiplied by 1/(m +k +1). But this might not directly lead to a diagonalization.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the kernel K(x,y) is the sum over m=0 to n\u22121 of x^{n\u22121\u2212m} y^m. So the integral operator K can be written as the sum of rank-1 operators:\n\nK = \u03a3_{m=0}^{n\u22121} A_m \u2297 B_m,\n\nwhere A_m(x) =x^{n\u22121\u2212m}, and B_m(y)=y^m. The operator is then a sum of operators that take the form (A_m)(x) times the integral of B_m(y) u(y) dy. Therefore, the operator K has rank n, and its eigenvalues correspond to the singular values or the eigenvalues from this decomposition. However, since the kernel is symmetric, the singular values are the absolute values of the eigenvalues, but since it's self-adjoint, all eigenvalues are real.\n\nBut perhaps there's a generating function or a more straightforward approach. For example, consider that the kernel K(x,y) = (x^n - y^n)/(x - y) which is the same as the sum from m=0 to n\u22121 of x^{n\u22121\u2212m} y^m. This can be recognized as the Schur polynomial or a generating function for symmetric polynomials. However, I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is asking for the values of \u03bb where there's no solution, and the answer is likely to be related to the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of K, but perhaps a specific value for \u03bb in terms of n. However, given that for n=1, \u03bb=1, and for n=2, \u03bb= -6 \u00b14\u221a3, which are specific values, there's no general formula given unless the answer expects an expression in terms of the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of K. Since the kernel is positive-definite (since it's symmetric and K(x,y) is a sum of positive terms when x and y are positive), but the eigenvalues could be positive or negative? Wait, for n=2, one of the eigenvalues was negative.\n\nBut regardless, the answer is that \u03bb must be such that it is the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel K. Therefore, the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to 1/\u03bc, where \u03bc is any eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K(x,y). Since the problem doesn't specify a particular n, the answer must be expressed in terms of these eigenvalues. \n\nHowever, perhaps there's a way to compute the eigenvalues for any n. Let's try for n=3. Then kernel K(x,y) =x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2. The integral equation becomes u(x)=1 +\u03bb \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2) u(y) dy. Let's define the integrals C0=\u222bu(y) dy, C1=\u222by u(y) dy, C2=\u222by\u00b2 u(y) dy. Then the equation becomes u(x)=1 +\u03bb (x\u00b2 C0 +x C1 + C2). Then substitute into the definitions:\n\nC0 = \u222b [1 +\u03bb (x\u00b2 C0 +x C1 + C2)] dx =1 +\u03bb C0 \u222bx\u00b2 dx +\u03bb C1 \u222bx dx +\u03bb C2 \u222bdx =1 +\u03bb C0 (1/3) +\u03bb C1 (1/2) +\u03bb C2 (1).\n\nSimilarly, C1=\u222bx [1 +\u03bb(x\u00b2 C0 +x C1 + C2)] dx= \u222bx dx +\u03bb C0 \u222bx\u00b3 dx +\u03bb C1 \u222bx\u00b2 dx +\u03bb C2 \u222bx dx =1/2 +\u03bb C0 (1/4) +\u03bb C1 (1/3) +\u03bb C2 (1/2).\n\nC2=\u222bx\u00b2 [1 +\u03bb (x\u00b2 C0 +x C1 + C2)] dx= \u222bx\u00b2 dx +\u03bb C0 \u222bx^4 dx +\u03bb C1 \u222bx^3 dx +\u03bb C2 \u222bx\u00b2 dx =1/3 +\u03bb C0 (1/5) +\u03bb C1 (1/4) +\u03bb C2 (1/3).\n\nSo the system is:\n\nC0 - (\u03bb/3) C0 - (\u03bb/2) C1 -\u03bb C2 =1.\n\n- (\u03bb/4) C0 + C1 - (\u03bb/3) C1 - (\u03bb/2) C2 =1/2.\n\n- (\u03bb/5) C0 - (\u03bb/4) C1 + C2 - (\u03bb/3) C2 =1/3.\n\nThis leads to a 3x3 system. Finding eigenvalues would involve solving the characteristic equation of the coefficient matrix, which is cubic and complicated. Hence, for general n, it's not feasible to write explicit eigenvalues without knowing n, but the pattern is that the values of \u03bb for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel K. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that \u03bb must be such that it is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K(x,y) = (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). \n\nBut the question asks for \"For what values of \u03bb does the equation have no solutions?\" So the answer is that \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the integral operator defined by the kernel K. But unless there's a specific pattern, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1/k for k=1 to n? Wait, for n=1, the eigenvalue is 1, which would give \u03bb=1. For n=2, the eigenvalues were approximately 1.077 and -0.077, which don't fit a 1/k pattern. So likely, the answer is that the values of \u03bb are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel K, which depend on n. Since the question is general, maybe the answer is that the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any of the eigenvalues of the given kernel, but in the absence of a specific n, the answer should state that. \n\nHowever, looking back at the problem statement, the integral equation is given for a general n, and the question is to determine for which \u03bb there are no solutions. The answer depends on the eigenvalues of the kernel, which vary with n. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u03bb must be such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the kernel. \n\nIn the context of multiple-choice questions, such an answer would be expressed as \u03bb = 1/\u03bc, where \u03bc is a non-zero eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K. However, since this is a free-response question, the answer should be that the equation has no solutions for \u03bb equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel K(x,y) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n\u22121} x^{n\u22121\u2212k} y^k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific answer in terms of the values of \u03bb, but without specific n, it's impossible to give numerical values. Hence, the answer must be phrased in terms of the eigenvalues of K. \n\nTherefore, the values of \u03bb for which the equation has no solutions are those \u03bb such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K(x,y) = (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). Therefore, the answer is \u03bb equals the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of this operator. \n\nBut since the problem requires a specific answer, and given the format, I think the answer is that for \u03bb equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel, which are the values that make the determinant of (I - \u03bb K) zero. Hence, the answer is that the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel K. So the answer is \u03bb = 1/\u03bc where \u03bc is an eigenvalue of K. \n\nThus, the answer is that \u03bb is such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the kernel. For the given integral equation, this is the condition under which the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions, and hence the non-homogeneous equation (with the \"1\" term) may lack solutions depending on the Fredholm alternative. Since the kernel is symmetric, if 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue and the inhomogeneous term (1) is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction, then there's no solution. However, since the kernel's eigenfunctions are polynomials up to degree n-1, and the inhomogeneous term is 1 (which is x^0), it might not be orthogonal to all eigenfunctions. Therefore, for each eigenvalue \u03bc of K, \u03bb=1/\u03bc is a value where the equation has no solution. \n\nSo the answer should be: the equation has no solutions for all \u03bb such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K(x,y). Therefore, the correct answer is that \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is about finding for which values of \u03bb the given integral equation has no solutions. The equation is u(x) = 1 + \u03bb \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y) u(y) dy, for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some integral equation theory. This looks like a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, right? The general form is u(x) = f(x) + \u03bb \u222b K(x,y)u(y) dy. Here, f(x) is 1, and the kernel K(x,y) is (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). \n\nI remember that for these equations, solutions exist except when \u03bb is the reciprocal of the eigenvalues of the kernel. So, the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the kernel. So, to find the \u03bb where there's no solution, we need to find the eigenvalues of the integral operator with this kernel and then take \u03bb to be the reciprocals. But wait, actually, in the standard Fredholm equation, the homogeneous equation (when f=0) has non-trivial solutions when \u03bb is an eigenvalue. So for the non-homogeneous equation (f not zero), if \u03bb is equal to an eigenvalue, then the solution might not exist unless certain conditions are met (like the Fredholm alternative). But the question here is when does the equation have no solutions. So, maybe when \u03bb is equal to an eigenvalue of the kernel, then the equation might not have a solution unless the right-hand side is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator. But since the right-hand side here is 1, which might not satisfy that orthogonality condition, so in those cases, when \u03bb is an eigenvalue, there are no solutions.\n\nTherefore, the values of \u03bb where the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel? Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. Wait, in the standard equation u = f + \u03bb Ku, the existence of solutions depends on \u03bb not being equal to the reciprocal of the eigenvalues. Wait, actually, the homogeneous equation Ku = \u03bc u has eigenvalues \u03bc. Then, the integral equation u = f + \u03bb Ku is equivalent to (I - \u03bb K)u = f. So, if 1/\u03bb is not an eigenvalue of K, then the operator (I - \u03bb K) is invertible, and there's a unique solution. If 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of K, then the operator is not invertible, so the equation might not have a solution unless f is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator. Therefore, the values of \u03bb where the equation has no solutions are those \u03bb such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of K and f is not orthogonal to the null space of (I - \u03bb K)*. \n\nIn this problem, f is 1, which might not be orthogonal to the eigenfunctions if \u03bb is such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue. Therefore, the answer is that the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of the eigenvalues of the kernel K. So the problem reduces to finding the eigenvalues of the kernel K(x,y) = (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). \n\nWait, let's compute the kernel. Let me simplify (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). That's the sum x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} y + ... + y^{n-1}, right? Because x\u207f - y\u207f = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} y + ... + y^{n-1}). So the kernel is actually K(x,y) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} y^{k}. \n\nHmm, so K(x,y) is a finite rank kernel, as it's a sum of separable terms. The integral operator with such a kernel is of finite rank, meaning it has a finite number of non-zero eigenvalues. Therefore, the eigenvalues can be found by considering the integral equation Ku = \u03bc u, where \u03bc is an eigenvalue. Let's write that out: \u03bc u(x) = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 K(x,y)u(y) dy. Substituting K(x,y) as the sum, we get \u03bc u(x) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{k} u(y) dy. Let's denote the integral \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^k u(y) dy as a_k. Then, the equation becomes \u03bc u(x) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^{n-1 -k}. Therefore, u(x) must be a linear combination of the functions x^{n-1 -k} for k=0,\u2026,n-1}, which are x^{n-1}, x^{n-2}, ..., x^0=1. Therefore, u(x) is a polynomial of degree at most n-1. \n\nSo, the eigenfunctions are polynomials of degree up to n-1, and the eigenvalues can be found by substituting u(x) as a linear combination of these basis functions. Let's consider a basis {1, x, x^2, ..., x^{n-1}} for the space of polynomials of degree \u2264n-1. Let's compute the operator K acting on each basis element. For example, take u_m(y) = y^m, where m is from 0 to n-1. Then, Ku_m(x) = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 K(x,y) y^m dy = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 [\u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} y^{k}] y^m dy = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{k + m} dy. The integral is 1/(k + m +1) when k + m +1 is evaluated from 0 to1. So, each term is x^{n-1 -k} / (k + m +1). Therefore, Ku_m(x) is a sum of terms involving x^{n-1 -k} multiplied by constants. \n\nBut since the operator K maps the basis functions into the space spanned by {x^{n-1}, x^{n-2}, ..., 1}, which is the same as the original basis. So, the operator K can be represented as a matrix in this basis, and the eigenvalues \u03bc are the eigenvalues of this matrix. Then, the eigenvalues \u03bb of the original integral equation would correspond to the reciprocals of these \u03bc's. \n\nHowever, this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the kernel is K(x,y) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} y^k, then K(x,y) is a degenerate (finite rank) kernel, and the integral equation can be rewritten as:\n\nu(x) = 1 + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^k u(y) dy.\n\nLet me denote the integrals as c_k = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^k u(y) dy. Then the equation becomes:\n\nu(x) = 1 + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} c_{k} x^{n-1 -k}.\n\nBut u(x) is expressed in terms of the coefficients c_k, which are integrals of y^k times u(y). Let's substitute this expression into the definition of c_m:\n\nc_m = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^m u(y) dy = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^m [1 + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1 -k}] dy.\n\nExpanding this:\n\nc_m = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^m dy + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^m y^{n-1 -k} dy.\n\nCompute the integrals:\n\nFirst term: \u222b y^m dy from 0 to1 is 1/(m+1).\n\nSecond term: the integral becomes \u222b y^{m + n -1 -k} dy = 1/(m + n -k) if m + n -k \u2265 0. Since k ranges from 0 to n-1, m is from 0 to n-1. Let me check m + n -k. Since k \u2264n-1, m \u22650, then m +n -k \u22650 +n - (n-1) =1, so always positive. So the integral is 1/(m +n -k +1)? Wait, no. Wait, the integral of y^p from 0 to1 is 1/(p+1). So, the exponent here is m +n -1 -k. Wait, m +n -1 -k +1 = m +n -k. Wait, no. The integral is \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{p} dy = 1/(p +1), where p = m + (n-1 -k) ? Wait, in the term: y^m multiplied by y^{n-1 -k} is y^{m + n -1 -k}. So the integral is \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{m +n -1 -k} dy = 1/(m +n -k) ), as the exponent is s = m +n -1 -k. Then, 1/(s+1) = 1/(m + n -k). \n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nc_m = 1/(m+1) + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k * [1/(m +n -k)].\n\nSo, this gives a system of linear equations for the coefficients c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}.\n\nLet's define the matrix equation. Let\u2019s arrange the equations for m =0,1,...,n-1:\n\nFor each m, the equation is:\n\nc_m - \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} [1/(m +n -k)] c_k = 1/(m+1).\n\nLet me write this in matrix form:\n\nLet A be an n x n matrix where the entry A_{m,k} = 1/(m +n -k). Then the system is:\n\n(I - \u03bb A^T) c = b,\n\nwhere c is the vector [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}], and b is the vector [1/(0+1), 1/(1+1), ..., 1/(n-1 +1)] = [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n].\n\nWait, wait. Wait the equation is:\n\nc_m = 1/(m+1) + \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} [1/(m +n -k)] c_k.\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nc_m - \u03bb \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} [1/(m +n -k)] c_k = 1/(m+1).\n\nTherefore, the system is (I - \u03bb A) c = b, where A_{m,k} = 1/(m +n -k). Wait, m and k go from 0 to n-1. Let's check for specific m and k. For example, m=0, k=0: A_{0,0}=1/(0 +n -0) =1/n. For m=0, k=1: 1/(0 +n -1)=1/(n-1). Similarly, m=1, k=0: 1/(1 +n -0)=1/(n+1). Hmm, seems that the entries vary.\n\nThe solvability of the system (I - \u03bb A)c = b depends on the determinant of (I - \u03bb A). If the determinant is non-zero, then there is a unique solution. If the determinant is zero, then the system may have no solution or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether b is in the image of (I - \u03bb A). \n\nTherefore, the values of \u03bb for which the equation has no solution are those \u03bb where 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the matrix A and the vector b is not orthogonal to the nullspace of (I - \u03bb A)^* (by the Fredholm alternative). However, calculating this for a general n might be complex. However, perhaps there's a pattern or a simpler way to find the eigenvalues of A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can notice that the kernel K(x,y) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 -k} y^k is related to the outer product of the vectors [x^{n-1}, x^{n-2}, ..., 1] and [1, y, ..., y^{n-1}]. Therefore, the matrix A might have a particular structure. Alternatively, perhaps the operator is of rank n, and the eigenvalues can be calculated through the matrix.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think of a specific case. Suppose n=1. Then K(x,y) = (x^1 - y^1)/(x - y) =1. So the kernel is 1. Then the equation becomes u(x) =1 + \u03bb \u222b\u2080\u00b9 1 * u(y) dy. So u(x) =1 + \u03bb C, where C = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 u(y) dy. Then, integrating both sides from 0 to1, we get C=1 + \u03bb C *1. So C=1 + \u03bb C. Therefore, solving for C: C - \u03bb C =1 => C(1 - \u03bb)=1. So C=1/(1 - \u03bb). Therefore, u(x)=1 + \u03bb/(1 - \u03bb) =1/(1 - \u03bb). But this requires that \u03bb \u22601. If \u03bb=1, then the equation becomes C=1 + C, which implies 0=1, which is impossible, so no solution. Therefore, for n=1, the equation has no solution when \u03bb=1. \n\nSimilarly, let's take n=2. Then K(x,y) = (x\u00b2 - y\u00b2)/(x - y) =x + y. So the kernel is x + y. The integral equation is u(x) =1 + \u03bb \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x + y)u(y) dy. Let's compute the integral: \u222b(x + y)u(y) dy = x \u222bu(y) dy + \u222b y u(y) dy. Let\u2019s denote C1=\u222bu(y) dy and C2=\u222by u(y) dy. Then the equation becomes u(x) =1 + \u03bb (x C1 + C2). Substitute this into the definitions of C1 and C2:\n\nC1 = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 [1 + \u03bb (x C1 + C2)] dx = \u222b1 dx + \u03bb C1 \u222bx dx + \u03bb C2 \u222b dx. \n\nCompute each integral:\n\n\u222b1 dx from 0 to1 =1.\n\n\u222bx dx =1/2.\n\n\u222bdx from 0 to1 =1.\n\nThus, C1 =1 + \u03bb C1*(1/2) + \u03bb C2*1.\n\nSimilarly, C2 = \u222b x [1 + \u03bb (x C1 + C2)] dx = \u222bx dx + \u03bb C1 \u222bx\u00b2 dx + \u03bb C2 \u222bx dx.\n\nCompute:\n\n\u222bx dx =1/2.\n\n\u222bx\u00b2 dx=1/3.\n\n\u222bx dx =1/2.\n\nSo, C2 =1/2 + \u03bb C1*(1/3) + \u03bb C2*(1/2).\n\nNow we have a system:\n\nC1 =1 + (\u03bb/2) C1 + \u03bb C2.\n\nC2 =1/2 + (\u03bb/3) C1 + (\u03bb/2) C2.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nC1 - (\u03bb/2) C1 - \u03bb C2 =1.\n\nC2 - (\u03bb/3) C1 - (\u03bb/2) C2 =1/2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nC1(1 - \u03bb/2) - \u03bb C2 =1.\n\n- (\u03bb/3) C1 + C2(1 - \u03bb/2) =1/2.\n\nThis is a linear system. Let's write in matrix form:\n\n[ (1 - \u03bb/2) , -\u03bb        ] [C1]   = [1]\n\n[ -\u03bb/3       , (1 - \u03bb/2) ] [C2]     [1/2]\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is:\n\nD = (1 - \u03bb/2)(1 - \u03bb/2) - ( -\u03bb)( -\u03bb/3 )\n\n= (1 - \u03bb + \u03bb\u00b2/4) - (\u03bb\u00b2 /3 )\n\n= 1 - \u03bb + (\u03bb\u00b2/4 - \u03bb\u00b2/3 )\n\n=1 - \u03bb + ( -\u03bb\u00b2/12 )\n\nSo D =1 - \u03bb - \u03bb\u00b2/12.\n\nFor the system to have a unique solution, D \u22600. If D=0, then the system may not have a solution or have infinitely many. So, the values of \u03bb that make D=0 are the ones where there's no solution or infinitely many. But since the non-homogeneous term is present, when D=0, the system may be inconsistent, leading to no solution. Thus, for n=2, the equation has no solution when 1 - \u03bb - \u03bb\u00b2/12 =0. Solving this quadratic equation: \u03bb\u00b2/12 +\u03bb -1=0 \u2192 \u03bb\u00b2 +12\u03bb -12=0 \u2192 \u03bb=(-12 \u00b1 sqrt(144 +48))/2 = (-12 \u00b1 sqrt(192))/2 = (-12 \u00b1 8\u221a3)/2= -6 \u00b14\u221a3. So the roots are \u03bb= -6 +4\u221a3 \u2248 -6 +6.928\u22480.928, and \u03bb= -6 -4\u221a3\u2248-12.928. But since the integral equation is over [0,1], and the kernel is positive? Wait, but \u03bb can be any real number. But the question is for which \u03bb there's no solution. So for these two roots, the determinant is zero, and hence the equation might not have a solution. But we need to check whether the system is inconsistent for those \u03bb. \n\nAlternatively, maybe for all \u03bb such that D=0, the system is inconsistent. However, this depends on the specific values. But according to the Fredholm alternative, if \u03bb is such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the kernel, then the equation has a solution iff the right-hand side is orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint kernel. However, in this case, with n=2, the kernel is K(x,y)=x+y, which is symmetric, so the operator is self-adjoint. The eigenvalues \u03bc of K satisfy Ku=\u03bc u. So, solving \u03bc u(x)=\u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x + y)u(y) dy. Let's find the eigenvalues. Let\u2019s assume u(x) is a linear function, since the kernel is x + y, which is rank 2. So the eigenfunctions are of the form ax + b. Let's substitute:\n\n\u03bc (ax + b) = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x + y)(ay + b) dy.\n\nExpand the RHS:\n\n= x \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (ay + b) dy + \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y (ay + b) dy.\n\nCompute integrals:\n\nFirst integral: a \u222b y dy + b \u222b dy = a*(1/2) + b*1 = a/2 + b.\n\nSecond integral: a \u222b y\u00b2 dy + b \u222b y dy = a*(1/3) + b*(1/2).\n\nThus, RHS =x(a/2 + b) + (a/3 + b/2).\n\nTherefore, equate to LHS \u03bc(ax + b):\n\n\u03bc a x + \u03bc b = (a/2 + b) x + (a/3 + b/2).\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\nFor x term: \u03bc a = a/2 + b.\n\nConstant term: \u03bc b = a/3 + b/2.\n\nThis is a system of equations:\n\n\u03bc a - a/2 - b =0.\n\n- a/3 + \u03bc b - b/2 =0.\n\nTo find non-trivial solutions (a,b \u22600), the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Arrange as:\n\n(\u03bc -1/2) a - b =0.\n\n(-1/3) a + (\u03bc -1/2) b =0.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n|(\u03bc -1/2)   -1          |\n\n| -1/3      (\u03bc -1/2)   |\n\n= (\u03bc -1/2)^2 - ( (-1)(-1/3) ) = (\u03bc -1/2)^2 -1/3.\n\nSet to zero:\n\n(\u03bc -1/2)^2 =1/3 \u2192 \u03bc -1/2=\u00b11/\u221a3 \u2192 \u03bc=1/2 \u00b11/\u221a3\u22480.5\u00b10.577. So \u03bc\u22481.077 or \u03bc\u2248-0.077. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of the kernel K are \u03bc=1/2 \u00b11/\u221a3. Thus, the eigenvalues \u03bb of the integral equation (where 1/\u03bb is the eigenvalues of K) are \u03bb=1/\u03bc. Therefore, the equation u=1 +\u03bb Ku has no solution when \u03bb=1/\u03bc. So \u03bb=1/(1/2 +1/\u221a3) and \u03bb=1/(1/2 -1/\u221a3). Simplifying:\n\nFirst eigenvalue: \u03bc1=1/2 +1/\u221a3 \u22481.077. Then \u03bb1=1/\u03bc1\u22480.928.\n\nSecond eigenvalue: \u03bc2=1/2 -1/\u221a3\u2248-0.077, so \u03bb2=1/\u03bc2\u2248-12.928.\n\nWhich matches the roots of the determinant D=0 for the system when n=2. Therefore, for these \u03bb values, the equation has no solution.\n\nSo generalizing, for any n, the values of \u03bb where the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel K(x,y). Since the kernel is of finite rank (n terms), there are n eigenvalues (including multiplicity), and thus there are n such \u03bb values (possibly complex, but since the kernel is real and symmetric when n is such that K is symmetric?), but wait, for general n, K(x,y)= (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y), which is symmetric only if n is even? Wait, no. Let me check. K(x,y) = x^{n-1} +x^{n-2} y + ... + y^{n-1}. So for example, n=2: K(x,y)=x + y, which is symmetric. n=3: K(x,y)=x\u00b2 + xy + y\u00b2, which is symmetric. For general n, K(x,y) is symmetric because swapping x and y gives K(y,x)=y^{n-1} + y^{n-2}x + ... +x^{n-1} = K(x,y). So the kernel is symmetric for any n. Therefore, the integral operator is self-adjoint, and its eigenvalues are real, and the eigenfunctions are orthogonal. \n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues \u03bc of K are real, and thus the values of \u03bb=1/\u03bc are also real. Therefore, the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of K.\n\nThus, the answer is that the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel K(x,y)=\u03a3_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1\u2212k} y^k. \n\nBut how to express this in terms of n? For example, when n=1, the kernel is K(x,y)=1, and the eigenvalue is \u03bc=1 (since \u222b\u2080\u00b91*1 dy=1, so the eigenvalue is 1). Hence, \u03bb=1 would be problematic, which matches the earlier case.\n\nFor general n, the eigenvalues \u03bc can be found by considering the integral operator's action on the basis functions. However, the exact eigenvalues depend on n. For example, when n=2, we found eigenvalues \u03bc=1/2 \u00b11/\u221a3. For general n, the eigenvalues would be solutions to the characteristic equation of the matrix A, but since A is an n x n matrix, this becomes complex. However, the question is asking for the answer in terms of \u03bb being the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of K, regardless of n. \n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern. Let's think of the kernel K(x,y)= (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x\u2212y)=x^{n\u22121}+x^{n\u22122} y+\u2026+y^{n\u22121}. Notice that for each fixed x, K(x,y) is a polynomial in y of degree n\u22121, and similarly for y. The integral operator K is a symmetric operator, and its eigenfunctions are polynomials of degree up to n\u22121. Therefore, the eigenvalues can be found by diagonalizing the matrix representation of K in the basis {1, x, x\u00b2, ..., x^{n\u22121}}. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a generating function approach or another method. For example, consider the integral operator K acting on x^k:\n\nK(x^k) = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 K(x,y) y^k dy = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x^{n\u22121} +x^{n\u22122} y + \u2026 + y^{n\u22121}) y^k dy = x^{n\u22121} \u222by^k dy + x^{n\u22122} \u222by^{k+1} dy + \u2026 + \u222b y^{k+n\u22121} dy.\n\nEach integral is 1/(k + m +1) for the terms x^{n\u22121\u2212m} \u222b y^{m +k} dy, where m ranges from 0 to n-1. Wait, no. Let's index the terms in K(x,y) as x^{n\u22121\u2212m} y^m for m from 0 to n\u22121. So:\n\nK(x,y) = \u03a3_{m=0}^{n\u22121} x^{n\u22121\u2212m} y^m.\n\nThus, K(x^k) = \u03a3_{m=0}^{n\u22121} x^{n\u22121\u2212m} \u222b\u2080\u00b9 y^{m +k} dy = \u03a3_{m=0}^{n\u22121} x^{n\u22121\u2212m} / (m +k +1).\n\nTherefore, when we express K in the basis {x^0, x^1, ..., x^{n\u22121}}, the matrix elements would be such that the entry for x^{n\u22121\u2212m} multiplied by 1/(m +k +1). But this might not directly lead to a diagonalization.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the kernel K(x,y) is the sum over m=0 to n\u22121 of x^{n\u22121\u2212m} y^m. So the integral operator K can be written as the sum of rank-1 operators:\n\nK = \u03a3_{m=0}^{n\u22121} A_m \u2297 B_m,\n\nwhere A_m(x) =x^{n\u22121\u2212m}, and B_m(y)=y^m. The operator is then a sum of operators that take the form (A_m)(x) times the integral of B_m(y) u(y) dy. Therefore, the operator K has rank n, and its eigenvalues correspond to the singular values or the eigenvalues from this decomposition. However, since the kernel is symmetric, the singular values are the absolute values of the eigenvalues, but since it's self-adjoint, all eigenvalues are real.\n\nBut perhaps there's a generating function or a more straightforward approach. For example, consider that the kernel K(x,y) = (x^n - y^n)/(x - y) which is the same as the sum from m=0 to n\u22121 of x^{n\u22121\u2212m} y^m. This can be recognized as the Schur polynomial or a generating function for symmetric polynomials. However, I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is asking for the values of \u03bb where there's no solution, and the answer is likely to be related to the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of K, but perhaps a specific value for \u03bb in terms of n. However, given that for n=1, \u03bb=1, and for n=2, \u03bb= -6 \u00b14\u221a3, which are specific values, there's no general formula given unless the answer expects an expression in terms of the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of K. Since the kernel is positive-definite (since it's symmetric and K(x,y) is a sum of positive terms when x and y are positive), but the eigenvalues could be positive or negative? Wait, for n=2, one of the eigenvalues was negative.\n\nBut regardless, the answer is that \u03bb must be such that it is the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel K. Therefore, the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to 1/\u03bc, where \u03bc is any eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K(x,y). Since the problem doesn't specify a particular n, the answer must be expressed in terms of these eigenvalues. \n\nHowever, perhaps there's a way to compute the eigenvalues for any n. Let's try for n=3. Then kernel K(x,y) =x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2. The integral equation becomes u(x)=1 +\u03bb \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2) u(y) dy. Let's define the integrals C0=\u222bu(y) dy, C1=\u222by u(y) dy, C2=\u222by\u00b2 u(y) dy. Then the equation becomes u(x)=1 +\u03bb (x\u00b2 C0 +x C1 + C2). Then substitute into the definitions:\n\nC0 = \u222b [1 +\u03bb (x\u00b2 C0 +x C1 + C2)] dx =1 +\u03bb C0 \u222bx\u00b2 dx +\u03bb C1 \u222bx dx +\u03bb C2 \u222bdx =1 +\u03bb C0 (1/3) +\u03bb C1 (1/2) +\u03bb C2 (1).\n\nSimilarly, C1=\u222bx [1 +\u03bb(x\u00b2 C0 +x C1 + C2)] dx= \u222bx dx +\u03bb C0 \u222bx\u00b3 dx +\u03bb C1 \u222bx\u00b2 dx +\u03bb C2 \u222bx dx =1/2 +\u03bb C0 (1/4) +\u03bb C1 (1/3) +\u03bb C2 (1/2).\n\nC2=\u222bx\u00b2 [1 +\u03bb (x\u00b2 C0 +x C1 + C2)] dx= \u222bx\u00b2 dx +\u03bb C0 \u222bx^4 dx +\u03bb C1 \u222bx^3 dx +\u03bb C2 \u222bx\u00b2 dx =1/3 +\u03bb C0 (1/5) +\u03bb C1 (1/4) +\u03bb C2 (1/3).\n\nSo the system is:\n\nC0 - (\u03bb/3) C0 - (\u03bb/2) C1 -\u03bb C2 =1.\n\n- (\u03bb/4) C0 + C1 - (\u03bb/3) C1 - (\u03bb/2) C2 =1/2.\n\n- (\u03bb/5) C0 - (\u03bb/4) C1 + C2 - (\u03bb/3) C2 =1/3.\n\nThis leads to a 3x3 system. Finding eigenvalues would involve solving the characteristic equation of the coefficient matrix, which is cubic and complicated. Hence, for general n, it's not feasible to write explicit eigenvalues without knowing n, but the pattern is that the values of \u03bb for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel K. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that \u03bb must be such that it is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K(x,y) = (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). \n\nBut the question asks for \"For what values of \u03bb does the equation have no solutions?\" So the answer is that \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the integral operator defined by the kernel K. But unless there's a specific pattern, perhaps the eigenvalues are 1/k for k=1 to n? Wait, for n=1, the eigenvalue is 1, which would give \u03bb=1. For n=2, the eigenvalues were approximately 1.077 and -0.077, which don't fit a 1/k pattern. So likely, the answer is that the values of \u03bb are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel K, which depend on n. Since the question is general, maybe the answer is that the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any of the eigenvalues of the given kernel, but in the absence of a specific n, the answer should state that. \n\nHowever, looking back at the problem statement, the integral equation is given for a general n, and the question is to determine for which \u03bb there are no solutions. The answer depends on the eigenvalues of the kernel, which vary with n. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u03bb must be such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the kernel. \n\nIn the context of multiple-choice questions, such an answer would be expressed as \u03bb = 1/\u03bc, where \u03bc is a non-zero eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K. However, since this is a free-response question, the answer should be that the equation has no solutions for \u03bb equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel K(x,y) = \u03a3_{k=0}^{n\u22121} x^{n\u22121\u2212k} y^k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific answer in terms of the values of \u03bb, but without specific n, it's impossible to give numerical values. Hence, the answer must be phrased in terms of the eigenvalues of K. \n\nTherefore, the values of \u03bb for which the equation has no solutions are those \u03bb such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K(x,y) = (x\u207f - y\u207f)/(x - y). Therefore, the answer is \u03bb equals the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of this operator. \n\nBut since the problem requires a specific answer, and given the format, I think the answer is that for \u03bb equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel, which are the values that make the determinant of (I - \u03bb K) zero. Hence, the answer is that the equation has no solutions when \u03bb is the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel K. So the answer is \u03bb = 1/\u03bc where \u03bc is an eigenvalue of K. \n\nThus, the answer is that \u03bb is such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the kernel. For the given integral equation, this is the condition under which the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions, and hence the non-homogeneous equation (with the \"1\" term) may lack solutions depending on the Fredholm alternative. Since the kernel is symmetric, if 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue and the inhomogeneous term (1) is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction, then there's no solution. However, since the kernel's eigenfunctions are polynomials up to degree n-1, and the inhomogeneous term is 1 (which is x^0), it might not be orthogonal to all eigenfunctions. Therefore, for each eigenvalue \u03bc of K, \u03bb=1/\u03bc is a value where the equation has no solution. \n\nSo the answer should be: the equation has no solutions for all \u03bb such that 1/\u03bb is an eigenvalue of the integral operator with kernel K(x,y). Therefore, the correct answer is that \u03bb is equal to the reciprocal of any eigenvalue of the kernel.",
