  "question": "How many logical qubits at most can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many logical qubits can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes each. Hmm, surface codes are a type of quantum error-correcting code, right? I remember that the surface code uses a lattice of physical qubits to create logical qubits. The number of logical qubits usually depends on the topology of the surface.\n\nEach surface code patch can have holes, which correspond to logical qubits. So, maybe each hole represents a logical qubit? Wait, I think that the number of logical qubits in a single surface code patch is determined by the number of holes. Specifically, each hole contributes two logical qubits? Or is it one per hole? Wait, no. Wait, the standard surface code, like the toric code, on a torus, has two logical qubits. But when you have a planar code with boundaries, adding a hole (like a puncture) in the surface creates additional logical qubits. \n\nI recall that for a planar code (a surface code on a plane with boundaries), the number of logical qubits is given by the number of holes. Each hole adds one logical qubit. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. In the planar code (with no handles, i.e., genus 0), each hole (or puncture) adds two logical qubits. Because each hole introduces two logical operators, one associated with the Z stabilizers around the hole and one with the X stabilizers. Or maybe each hole gives one logical qubit. Wait, maybe the formula is that the number of logical qubits is 2g + h - 1, where g is the genus (number of handles) and h is the number of holes. But I might be mixing things up here.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: a single planar surface code (with no holes) encodes 0 logical qubits? No, that can't be. Wait, the standard planar code (without any holes) actually encodes one logical qubit. Wait, maybe when you create a code with boundaries, you get one logical qubit. If you add a hole, maybe that adds another logical qubit. So, for example, if you have a surface code with two holes, like two separate punctures, then the number of logical qubits would be 2 + 1? Wait, no. Let me check. \n\nI think the formula for the number of logical qubits in a surface code is given by k = 2g + h - 1, where g is the genus (number of handles) and h is the number of holes (punctures). But maybe another version is that each hole adds one logical qubit, and each handle (like a torus handle) adds two. For example, a torus (g=1, h=0) would have k=2. A planar code with h=0 (no holes) would have k=1. If you have h=1 hole, then k=1 +1 = 2? Or wait, maybe each hole adds two. Because when you make a hole, you create two new logical operators, one around the hole and one through it? So perhaps each hole contributes two logical qubits. But that doesn't align with some references I've seen. Wait. Let's try to recall. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: the number of encoded logical qubits in the surface code is equal to the number of non-contractible loops that can't be deformed into each other or into a boundary. For each hole in the surface, you can create a loop around it and a loop through it. But maybe each hole contributes two logical qubits. Wait, no. For instance, a single planar code (no holes) has one logical qubit. If you have a code with two separate patches, each being a surface code, then each patch can encode some number of logical qubits. Wait, the problem says \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". So each patch has two holes? Wait, the question is ambiguous. Wait, the user says \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". Wait, maybe each patch has two holes. Or perhaps the two patches collectively have two holes. Wait, the wording is unclear. Let me read the question again: \"How many logical qubits at most can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes?\" So, two patches, and each has two holes? Or two patches in total, and in those two patches combined, there are two holes? Hmmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each patch is a surface code that can have a certain number of logical qubits based on the number of holes. For example, if each patch has n holes, then each patch can encode n logical qubits. Then two patches would encode 2n. But that depends on how the holes contribute. Wait, maybe each hole adds two logical qubits. Wait, in the surface code, I think each hole (or puncture) contributes two logical qubits. Wait, no, in the case of the toric code (which is a surface code on a torus), the number of logical qubits is 2, which comes from the genus (g=1), so 2g=2. If a planar code (g=0) with h holes, then maybe the formula is 2h. But that can't be right because a planar code without holes (h=0) would give 0, but in reality, the planar code (without holes) encodes one logical qubit. So perhaps the formula is k = 2g + h. But if g=0 (planar), then k = h. But then h=0 would give k=0, but in reality the planar code with no holes (or just a single boundary) encodes 1 logical qubit. So that formula is not correct. \n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is k = 2g + (h - 1). For example, if you have a sphere (g=0) with h holes, then k = h -1. But if h=1, then k=0, which is wrong because a single hole (like a disk) would have one logical qubit. Wait, this is getting confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a planar code (g=0), the number of logical qubits is h, where h is the number of holes. For instance, a single planar code (a disk, h=1) encodes one logical qubit. If you have two holes (like a annulus, h=2), then you get two logical qubits. So each additional hole adds one logical qubit. But then two holes would mean two logical qubits per patch. So if each patch has two holes, then each patch encodes two logical qubits, and two patches would give a total of four. But the problem says \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". Wait, maybe each patch has one hole, and there are two patches. Then each patch would have one hole, so each encodes one logical qubit, total two. But the question says \"two holes\". Hmm. Wait, maybe the two patches collectively have two holes. So each patch is a surface code. If each surface code (patch) has a certain number of holes. For example, if each patch has one hole, then two patches would each contribute one, total two. If each patch has two holes, then two patches would have four logical qubits. But I need to clarify how the holes relate to the logical qubits per patch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each hole in a surface code allows for two logical qubits. For example, a torus (which is a surface with one handle, genus 1) has two logical qubits. So genus g gives 2g logical qubits. Then, for planar codes with holes (punctures), each puncture adds one logical qubit. Wait, but here's a source of confusion. Let me recall that in surface codes, the number of logical qubits is given by the formula 2g + h - 1, where h is the number of boundaries (holes). Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me try to find a reference in my mind. \n\nWait, according to some sources, the number of logical qubits in a surface code is determined by the number of holes or punctures. Each hole contributes two logical qubits. Wait, no, that's for toric code on a torus. Wait, maybe for a planar code with n holes, the number of logical qubits is n. For example, if you have a planar code with two holes, you get two logical qubits. So each hole adds a logical qubit. Then, two patches, each with one hole, would have two logical qubits. But the question states \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". If each patch is a surface code that has two holes, then each patch would have two logical qubits, so two patches would have four. But maybe the two patches each have one hole, totaling two holes across both patches. Then each patch with one hole (each patch having one logical qubit), so total two logical qubits. Wait, the problem is ambiguous in wording. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about two separate surface code patches, each of which has two holes. If each patch with two holes can encode two logical qubits, then two patches would encode four. So the answer would be four. Alternatively, if each hole gives two logical qubits, then two holes per patch would be four per patch, times two patches would be eight. But that seems high. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take an example. A single planar surface code with one boundary (a disk) encodes one logical qubit. If we create a hole (puncture) in the middle, making it an annulus (like a doughnut shape but in 2D, with two boundaries: the outer and inner), then this would add another logical qubit. So two logical qubits. Because the hole allows for an additional pair of logical operators (one around the hole and one through it). Wait, but in 2D, for each hole (boundary), you can have a logical operator around it and another through it. So perhaps each hole contributes two logical qubits. But wait, that would mean a single hole (annulus) gives two logical qubits. Wait, but earlier thought was that the disk (one hole) has one logical qubit. So maybe that's incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the standard surface code (planar) with one boundary (a single outer boundary) encodes one logical qubit. If you add another boundary (a hole), making it an annulus, then you have two logical qubits. Each additional hole adds one more logical qubit. So the formula would be k = number of holes. Wait, but for the annulus (two boundaries), the number of logical qubits is two. Hmm. Wait, maybe for a surface with n boundaries (holes), the number of logical qubits is n - 1. So if you have a single boundary (disk), it's n=1, so k=0? That's not right. That contradicts the fact that planar code encodes one logical qubit. So maybe this approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is that the number of logical qubits equals the number of holes (boundaries) minus one. So for a disk (n=1), k=0. But in reality, planar code (disk) encodes one logical qubit. So that's not matching. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from different ways of counting boundaries. The standard planar code has two boundaries: one for the rough (Z-type) and one for the smooth (X-type) boundary. Wait, no. The surface code is typically defined on a lattice with two types of stabilizers (plaquette and star), and the boundaries can be of different types. But the number of logical qubits is determined by the topology. \n\nI think the correct formula is that for a planar surface code (genus 0), each hole (or puncture) allows for an additional logical qubit, but the base number is one. So if you have a single patch with h holes, then the number of logical qubits is 1 + h. Wait, but then a disk (h=0) would have one logical qubit, which is correct. An annulus (h=1) would have two, etc. So each hole adds one. So if a patch has two holes, then 1 + 2 = 3 logical qubits. Then two such patches would have 3 * 2 = 6. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each hole adds two logical qubits. For example, a torus (g=1) has two logical qubits, which is 2g. If you have h holes in a planar code (g=0), maybe each hole adds two, so 2h. But then a disk with two holes would have four logical qubits. But I\u2019m not sure. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me try to recall a specific example. In the paper \"Surface codes: Towards practical large-scale quantum computation\" by Fowler et al., the number of logical qubits in a planar code with holes is discussed. For example, a single planar code (with no additional holes) encodes one logical qubit. If you introduce a hole (like a defect or a puncture), you can encode additional logical qubits. Each such hole allows for two logical qubits. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Maybe each hole allows for one additional logical qubit. For example, a single hole (annulus) allows two logical qubits. Wait, no. Let me check: in a planar code with one hole (like a defect), you can have logical operators that loop around the hole and ones that go from the outer boundary to the hole. But I think each hole contributes two logical qubits. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: the number of logical qubits in a surface code is equal to the number of encoded qubits, which is determined by the topology. For a surface with genus g and b boundaries, the number of logical qubits is 2g + b -1. If that's the case, then for two separate patches (each with their own topology), the total logical qubits would be the sum of each patch's contribution. \n\nSo for each surface code patch, if it's a planar code (g=0) with two holes (b=2), then the logical qubits would be 2*0 + 2 -1 = 1. Wait, that gives 1 per patch. Then two patches would sum to 2. But that contradicts previous thoughts. Hmm. \n\nWait, the formula from topology for the number of encoded qubits is k = 2g + (b - c), where c is the number of connected components. But I'm not sure. Another formula I found (though unsure) is that for a surface with genus g and b boundaries, the number of logical qubits is k = 2g + b -1. So for each planar patch (g=0) with two boundaries (i.e., two holes), the number of logical qubits would be 0 + 2 -1 = 1. So each patch contributes one. Two patches would then have 2. But the question is asking for the maximum number of logical qubits. Maybe there's a way to arrange the holes to get more. \n\nAlternatively, if each patch has genus g and h holes, but I\u2019m getting lost. Let me think of each patch as a separate surface. Suppose each patch has two holes (two boundaries), then according to the formula k = 2g + b -1, with g=0, b=2, so k=0+2-1=1 per patch. Two patches would have 2. But maybe the patches can be connected in a way that increases the genus. But the problem states \"two patches\", which are separate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the holes being referred to are not boundaries but actual punctures that create additional logical qubits. For example, in the surface code, each puncture (hole) allows for storing a logical qubit. Some sources say that each puncture can encode a logical qubit, and additional logical qubits can be created by the topology. Hmm. \n\nAnother way: the standard surface code (planar, no holes) encodes one logical qubit. Each additional hole (puncture) adds one logical qubit. So if you have a surface code with two holes (punctures), you get 1 + 2 = 3 logical qubits. But wait, maybe each puncture adds two logical qubits. \n\nAlternatively, in the surface code, each hole (or \"defect\") is associated with both a Z-type and an X-type logical operator, hence contributing two logical qubits. But I think that's not correct. For each defect (hole), you can define a pair of logical operators (one for Z and one for X), hence two logical qubits per hole. But I'm not certain. \n\nWait, looking back at some notes: In the surface code, each logical qubit corresponds to a pair of non-contractible loops (one for X and one for Z). Adding a hole (puncture) in the lattice allows for the creation of additional logical qubits. For each hole, you can have a logical operator that encircles the hole (like a loop around it) and one that goes from the boundary through the hole. So each hole effectively adds two logical qubits. But that can't be right because the standard surface code (with no holes) has one logical qubit. If you add a hole, maybe you get two more, totaling three. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, in the surface code with n holes, the number of logical qubits is 2n. Because each hole allows for two logical qubits. But then the standard surface code (n=0) would have 0, which is wrong. Hmm. \n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to find a different angle. Suppose each surface code patch can encode a number of logical qubits based on its topology. If a single patch has two holes, how many logical qubits does it have? \n\nIf a patch has one hole (like an annulus), it encodes two logical qubits. If it has two holes, it encodes four. Because each hole gives two. Then two patches with two holes each would have 4 * 2 = 8 logical qubits. But I don't recall such a high number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each hole in a surface code adds one logical qubit. So two holes per patch would mean two logical qubits per patch. Two patches would have four. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of logical qubits in two patches with two holes in total would be four. For example, each hole allows two logical qubits, and two holes give four. \n\nWait, the problem says \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". Are the two holes in each patch or in total? The wording is ambiguous. If each patch has two holes, then two patches have four holes total. If the total holes across both patches are two, then each patch has one hole. \n\nAssuming that each patch is a surface code with two holes, meaning each has two holes, then per patch, how many logical qubits? If each hole gives one logical qubit, then two holes per patch gives two logical qubits, total four. If each hole gives two, then four per patch, total eight. \n\nBut I'm not confident. Another approach: look for standard results. The surface code typically encodes one logical qubit per \"patch\" or per region. But when you add holes (defects), you can create more. Each hole allows for additional logical qubits. For example, in some papers, creating a pair of holes (defects) allows for a logical qubit to be stored between them. So perhaps each pair of holes gives one logical qubit. So two holes (as in a pair) would give one logical qubit. Then two patches each with two holes (so one logical qubit per patch) would total two logical qubits. But that seems low. \n\nAlternatively, each single hole in a surface code allows for encoding a logical qubit. So two holes would give two logical qubits. But then two patches would each contribute two, totaling four. \n\nBut I'm getting myself mixed up. Maybe the correct answer is four. Because each hole allows two logical qubits, two holes per patch, two patches: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8? No. If each hole gives two, two holes per patch would be four per patch, two patches would be eight. But I don't think that's right. \n\nAlternatively, if each surface code patch, regardless of holes, encodes one logical qubit, and each hole adds one more. Then two patches with two holes each would be (1 + 2) * 2 = 6. But I've never heard of that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is that each hole adds one logical qubit. So two patches with two holes each: each patch has two holes, thus two logical qubits per patch, total four. \n\nThat seems plausible. If each hole in a surface code allows for an additional logical qubit, then two patches with two holes each would have four logical qubits. \n\nBut I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is four. Let me try to remember some examples. For example, a single surface code patch with one hole (annulus) encodes two logical qubits. That's because the loop around the hole and the loop connecting the inner and outer boundaries. So maybe each hole adds two. Then two holes would add four. So two patches would have eight. But this contradicts the standard knowledge that a surface code typically encodes one logical qubit per patch. \n\nWait, no. The standard surface code (planar) has one logical qubit. Adding a hole (making it an annulus) might add another logical qubit, making it two. Then each hole adds one. So two holes would make three logical qubits. But that seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, the number of logical qubits in a surface code is equal to the number of holes plus one. So one hole gives two logical qubits. Two holes give three. So two patches with two holes each would have (2+1)*2=6? That doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nThis is really challenging. I think I need to settle on the most plausible answer. Given that each surface code patch can have logical qubits depending on the number of holes, and each hole contributes one logical qubit, then two patches with two holes each would have 2 * 2 = 4 logical qubits. So the answer is 4. However, I'm not entirely confident because I might be misremembering the exact formula. But given the options and the thought process, I'll go with four.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: In surface code quantum error correction, the number of logical qubits depends on the topology of the code patches.

Wait, no, in the case of the toric code (which is a surface code on a torus), the number of logical qubits is 2, which comes from the genus (g=1), so 2g=2. If a planar code (g=0) with h holes, then maybe the formula is 2h.

So maybe this approach is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is that the number of logical qubits equals the number of holes (boundaries) minus one. So for a disk (n=1), k=0. But in reality, planar code (disk) encodes one logical qubit. So that's not matching. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from different ways of counting boundaries. The standard planar code has two boundaries: one for the rough (Z-type) and one for the smooth (X-type) boundary. Wait, no. The surface code is typically defined on a lattice with two types of stabilizers (plaquette and star), and the boundaries can be of different types. But the number of logical qubits is determined by the topology. \n\nI think the correct formula is that for a planar surface code (genus 0), each hole (or puncture) allows for an additional logical qubit, but the base number is one. So if you have a single patch with h holes, then the number of logical qubits is 1 + h. Wait, but then a disk (h=0) would have one logical qubit, which is correct. An annulus (h=1) would have two, etc. So each hole adds one. So if a patch has two holes, then 1 + 2 = 3 logical qubits. Then two such patches would have 3 * 2 = 6. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each hole adds two logical qubits. For example, a torus (g=1) has two logical qubits, which is 2g. If you have h holes in a planar code (g=0), maybe each hole adds two, so 2h. But then a disk with two holes would have four logical qubits. But I\u2019m not sure. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me try to recall a specific example. In the paper \"Surface codes: Towards practical large-scale quantum computation\" by Fowler et al., the number of logical qubits in a planar code with holes is discussed. For example, a single planar code (with no additional holes) encodes one logical qubit. If you introduce a hole (like a defect or a puncture), you can encode additional logical qubits. Each such hole allows for two logical qubits. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Maybe each hole allows for one additional logical qubit. For example, a single hole (annulus) allows two logical qubits. Wait, no. Let me check: in a planar code with one hole (like a defect), you can have logical operators that loop around the hole and ones that go from the outer boundary to the hole. But I think each hole contributes two logical qubits. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: the number of logical qubits in a surface code is equal to the number of encoded qubits, which is determined by the topology. For a surface with genus g and b boundaries, the number of logical qubits is 2g + b -1. If that's the case, then for two separate patches (each with their own topology), the total logical qubits would be the sum of each patch's contribution. \n\nSo for each surface code patch, if it's a planar code (g=0) with two holes (b=2), then the logical qubits would be 2*0 + 2 -1 = 1. Wait, that gives 1 per patch. Then two patches would sum to 2. But that contradicts previous thoughts. Hmm. \n\nWait, the formula from topology for the number of encoded qubits is k = 2g + (b - c), where c is the number of connected components. But I'm not sure. Another formula I found (though unsure) is that for a surface with genus g and b boundaries, the number of logical qubits is k = 2g + b -1. So for each planar patch (g=0) with two boundaries (i.e., two holes), the number of logical qubits would be 0 + 2 -1 = 1. So each patch contributes one. Two patches would then have 2. But the question is asking for the maximum number of logical qubits. Maybe there's a way to arrange the holes to get more. \n\nAlternatively, if each patch has genus g and h holes, but I\u2019m getting lost. Let me think of each patch as a separate surface. Suppose each patch has two holes (two boundaries), then according to the formula k = 2g + b -1, with g=0, b=2, so k=0+2-1=1 per patch. Two patches would have 2. But maybe the patches can be connected in a way that increases the genus. But the problem states \"two patches\", which are separate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the holes being referred to are not boundaries but actual punctures that create additional logical qubits. For example, in the surface code, each puncture (hole) allows for storing a logical qubit. Some sources say that each puncture can encode a logical qubit, and additional logical qubits can be created by the topology. Hmm. \n\nAnother way: the standard surface code (planar, no holes) encodes one logical qubit. Each additional hole (puncture) adds one logical qubit. So if you have a surface code with two holes (punctures), you get 1 + 2 = 3 logical qubits. But wait, maybe each puncture adds two logical qubits. \n\nAlternatively, in the surface code, each hole (or \"defect\") is associated with both a Z-type and an X-type logical operator, hence contributing two logical qubits. But I think that's not correct. For each defect (hole), you can define a pair of logical operators (one for Z and one for X), hence two logical qubits per hole. But I'm not certain. \n\nWait, looking back at some notes: In the surface code, each logical qubit corresponds to a pair of non-contractible loops (one for X and one for Z). Adding a hole (puncture) in the lattice allows for the creation of additional logical qubits. For each hole, you can have a logical operator that encircles the hole (like a loop around it) and one that goes from the boundary through the hole. So each hole effectively adds two logical qubits. But that can't be right because the standard surface code (with no holes) has one logical qubit. If you add a hole, maybe you get two more, totaling three. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, in the surface code with n holes, the number of logical qubits is 2n. Because each hole allows for two logical qubits. But then the standard surface code (n=0) would have 0, which is wrong. Hmm. \n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to find a different angle. Suppose each surface code patch can encode a number of logical qubits based on its topology. If a single patch has two holes, how many logical qubits does it have? \n\nIf a patch has one hole (like an annulus), it encodes two logical qubits. If it has two holes, it encodes four. Because each hole gives two. Then two patches with two holes each would have 4 * 2 = 8 logical qubits. But I don't recall such a high number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each hole in a surface code adds one logical qubit. So two holes per patch would mean two logical qubits per patch. Two patches would have four. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of logical qubits in two patches with two holes in total would be four. For example, each hole allows two logical qubits, and two holes give four. \n\nWait, the problem says \"two patches of surface code with two holes\". Are the two holes in each patch or in total? The wording is ambiguous. If each patch has two holes, then two patches have four holes total. If the total holes across both patches are two, then each patch has one hole. \n\nAssuming that each patch is a surface code with two holes, meaning each has two holes, then per patch, how many logical qubits? If each hole gives one logical qubit, then two holes per patch gives two logical qubits, total four. If each hole gives two, then four per patch, total eight. \n\nBut I'm not confident. Another approach: look for standard results. The surface code typically encodes one logical qubit per \"patch\" or per region. But when you add holes (defects), you can create more. Each hole allows for additional logical qubits. For example, in some papers, creating a pair of holes (defects) allows for a logical qubit to be stored between them. So perhaps each pair of holes gives one logical qubit. So two holes (as in a pair) would give one logical qubit. Then two patches each with two holes (so one logical qubit per patch) would total two logical qubits. But that seems low. \n\nAlternatively, each single hole in a surface code allows for encoding a logical qubit. So two holes would give two logical qubits. But then two patches would each contribute two, totaling four. \n\nBut I'm getting myself mixed up. Maybe the correct answer is four. Because each hole allows two logical qubits, two holes per patch, two patches: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8? No. If each hole gives two, two holes per patch would be four per patch, two patches would be eight. But I don't think that's right. \n\nAlternatively, if each surface code patch, regardless of holes, encodes one logical qubit, and each hole adds one more. Then two patches with two holes each would be (1 + 2) * 2 = 6. But I've never heard of that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is that each hole adds one logical qubit. So two patches with two holes each: each patch has two holes, thus two logical qubits per patch, total four. \n\nThat seems plausible. If each hole in a surface code allows for an additional logical qubit, then two patches with two holes each would have four logical qubits. \n\nBut I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is four. Let me try to remember some examples. For example, a single surface code patch with one hole (annulus) encodes two logical qubits. That's because the loop around the hole and the loop connecting the inner and outer boundaries. So maybe each hole adds two. Then two holes would add four. So two patches would have eight. But this contradicts the standard knowledge that a surface code typically encodes one logical qubit per patch. \n\nWait, no. The standard surface code (planar) has one logical qubit. Adding a hole (making it an annulus) might add another logical qubit, making it two. Then each hole adds one. So two holes would make three logical qubits. But that seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, the number of logical qubits in a surface code is equal to the number of holes plus one. So one hole gives two logical qubits. Two holes give three. So two patches with two holes each would have (2+1)*2=6? That doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nThis is really challenging. I think I need to settle on the most plausible answer. Given that each surface code patch can have logical qubits depending on the number of holes, and each hole contributes one logical qubit, then two patches with two holes each would have 2 * 2 = 4 logical qubits. So the answer is 4. However, I'm not entirely confident because I might be misremembering the exact formula. But given the options and the thought process, I'll go with four.",
