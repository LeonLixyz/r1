  "question": "What are the maximal number of pieces obtained by slicing a torus (or a bagel) with 10 cuts?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the maximum number of pieces you can get by slicing a torus with 10 cuts. Hmm, I remember that for a sphere or a cake (which is like a 3D object), the formula for the maximum number of pieces with n cuts is something like (n^3 + 5n + 6)/6. Wait, but a torus is a different shape. Maybe the formula is different?\n\nWait, let me think. The problem is about a torus, which has a hole in the middle. The way the cuts intersect might be different compared to a sphere because of that hole. I think the formula for the maximum number of regions created by n cuts in a torus is different from the standard 3D case.\n\nI recall that the general formula for the maximum regions R(n) for a torus is given by R(n) = n(n - 1) + 2. Or wait, is that for something else? Wait, no, maybe that's for a circle on a plane. Wait, for a circle (2D), the maximum number with n cuts is n(n+1)/2 +1. But that's not right either. Let me get this straight.\n\nIn 3D, the standard formula (like for a sphere) is (n^3 + 5n + 6)/6. For example, for n=1, it's (1 +5 +6)/6=12/6=2. That makes sense. For n=2, (8 +10 +6)/6=24/6=4. But wait, two cuts on a sphere would give 4 pieces. Hmm. But for a torus, the maximum number is different. \n\nI remember that for a torus, the formula is n(n - 1) + 2. Wait, let me check. If n=1, then 1*0 +2=2. Which makes sense. One cut on a torus would split it into two pieces. For n=2, 2(1)+2=4. That seems possible. Wait, but maybe the formula is similar to the 2D case but adjusted. \n\nWait, another approach: The problem is similar to the number of regions divided by hyperplanes in a space, but adjusted for the topology of the torus. Wait, in the case of a torus, which is a surface with genus 1, the formula might be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is n\u00b2 -n +2. Let's test for small n. For n=1, 1-1+2=2. For n=2, 4-2 +2=4. For n=3, 9-3 +2=8. Hmm, does that make sense? Let's see. For the torus, each new cut can intersect all previous cuts to maximize regions. Wait, the general formula for the maximum number of regions formed by n cuts on a torus is n\u00b2 -n +2. But let me verify.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to look for the sequence. Let me look up the formula for maximum regions on a torus. Wait, but I can't actually look it up, so I have to derive it. \n\nIn 2D, the maximum number of regions with n lines is (n\u00b2 +n +2)/2. But for a torus, which is a different topology, perhaps there's a different formula. Wait, but the question is about a 3D torus. Wait, no, the torus is a 2-dimensional surface, but embedded in 3D space. So when making cuts (slices), we are making 2-dimensional intersections. \n\nWait, maybe each cut is a plane cutting through the torus. The problem is similar to how many regions 3D space can be divided by n planes, but adjusted for the torus. Wait, no, the regions are on the torus itself. So perhaps the problem is about the maximum number of regions a torus can be divided into by n planar cuts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is similar to the circle division problem. For a circle (1D), it's n(n-1)/2 +1. But for the torus, maybe the formula is different. Wait, but the torus is 2-dimensional. So perhaps the formula is similar to dividing a 2D surface. For a plane, the maximum regions with n lines is n(n+1)/2 +1. For a torus, perhaps the formula is n(n-1) +2. Let's check n=1: 0+2=2. n=2: 2(1)+2=4. n=3: 3*2+2=8. Wait, but 3 cuts would give 8 regions? Let's think. If each new cut intersects all previous ones, each new cut would add 2n regions. Wait, but perhaps for the torus, each new cut can intersect all previous cuts twice. So maybe the formula is quadratic. Let me think recursively. Suppose after k-1 cuts, we have M(k-1) regions. The k-th cut can intersect the previous k-1 cuts in 2(k-1) points (since on a torus, each pair of cuts can intersect twice), dividing the cut into 2(k-1) segments, each adding a region. So the number of new regions added by the k-th cut would be 2(k-1). Therefore, the recurrence relation would be M(k) = M(k-1) + 2(k-1). Starting with M(0)=1 (no cuts, one region). Then M(1)=1+2*0=1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, initial conditions: M(0) =1, when no cuts, one region. Then M(1)=1 +2*0=1? But that can't be right. Because the first cut would split the torus into two regions. Hmm. So maybe the recurrence is different. Let me see. Let's think again. For each new k-th cut, the number of new regions added is equal to the number of times the new cut crosses the previous cuts. On a plane, each new line can cross each existing line once, adding k regions for the k-th line. But on a torus, maybe each existing cut is crossed twice by the new cut. So each new cut intersects each previous cut twice. Therefore, the number of intersections for the k-th cut would be 2(k-1). Each intersection creates a new segment, which adds a region. So for the k-th cut, the number of new regions added would be 2(k-1). Therefore, the total number after n cuts would be M(n) = M(n-1) + 2(n-1). Let's compute this. Starting from M(0)=1. Then M(1)=1 +0=1? That can't be right. Because with one cut, you have two regions. Hmm. Maybe the initial conditions are different. Wait, perhaps when making the first cut (n=1), the torus is split into two regions. So M(1)=2. Then for the second cut, the maximum number of regions would be M(2) = M(1) + 2*1 =2 +2=4. For the third cut: M(3)=4 +2*2=8. Then M(4)=8 +2*3=14. Wait, but let's check with n=1: 2, n=2:4, n=3:8, n=4:14. Wait, but the formula seems to be M(n)=M(n-1) +2(n-1). Then M(n) = 2 + 2*(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)). Wait, since each term after M(1) is adding 2*(k-1). So for n >=1, the total would be 2 + 2*(sum from k=1 to n-1 of k) ). The sum from k=1 to m is m(m+1)/2. Here, m =n-1. So sum is (n-1)n/2. Then M(n) = 2 + 2*(n-1)n/2) = 2 + n(n-1). So M(n)=n(n-1)+2. For n=1, 1*0 +2=2. For n=2, 2*1 +2=4. For n=3, 3*2 +2=8. For n=4, 4*3 +2=14. That seems to fit. So the formula is n(n-1) +2. Therefore, for 10 cuts, the maximum number of pieces would be 10*9 +2=90 +2=92. \n\nBut wait, let me check this with some references I remember. For example, I think the formula for the torus is indeed quadratic, unlike the cubic formula for 3D objects. So the answer would be 10*9 +2=92. Therefore, the maximal number is 92.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The maximum number of pieces obtained by slicing a torus with \\( n \\) cuts follows the formula \\( n(n - 1) + 2 \\). This formula arises because each new cut intersects all previous cuts twice (due to the torus's topology), adding \\( 2(n-1) \\) regions per cut.
