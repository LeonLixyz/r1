  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this puzzle. So, the problem gives us several inputs and their corresponding outputs and asks us to find the missing output for Input_C. Let's start by analyzing the examples provided to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input to the output.\n\nFirst, looking at Input_A and Output_A. Input_A is '001111,121111,111111', which becomes Output_A '201111,101111,111111'. Let me split these into rows to better visualize them.\n\nInput_A rows:\n1. 001111\n2. 121111\n3. 111111\n\nOutput_A rows:\n1. 201111\n2. 101111\n3. 111111\n\nHmm, what's changing here? Let's look at each position. Starting with the first row of Input_A: 0,0,1,1,1,1. The output is 2,0,1,1,1,1. So the first two digits changed from 00 to 20. The third digit changed from 1 to 1? Wait, no, the third digit was 1 in input and remains 1. Wait, maybe I need to check column-wise instead of row-wise. Let me check the columns. Let's see each column for the three rows.\n\nLooking at the first column across all rows in Input_A:\n0 (from first row), 1 (second row), 1 (third row). In Output_A, the first column becomes 2,1,1. Wait, how? So the first element in the first column changed from 0 to 2. The second row's first element was 1 and became 1. The third row's first element was 1 and stayed 1. That's a bit confusing. Let me check other columns.\n\nSecond column in Input_A: 0 (first row), 2 (second row), 1 (third row). Output_A's second column: 0 (first row), 0 (second row), 1 (third row). So the second row's second element changed from 2 to 0. Third column: in Input_A, all rows have 1 in third column. Output_A remains 1s. Hmm. Maybe looking for some specific patterns, like certain numbers changing based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell is transformed based on some rule. Let's look for cells that changed. In Input_A, the first row's first two digits changed from 00 to 20. The second row's first digit changed from 1 to 1 (no change?), wait no. Wait, the second row's first digit in Input_A is 1, and in Output_A, it's 1. Wait, maybe looking at the cells where the number changed. Let me list the changes:\n\nInput_A to Output_A changes:\n\nRow 1:\n0 \u2192 2 (position 1)\n0 \u2192 0 (position 2)\nOther positions stay 1.\n\nRow 2:\n1 \u2192 1 (no change)\n2 \u2192 0 (position 2)\nOther positions stay 1.\n\nRow 3:\nNo changes.\n\nWait, maybe this is about the presence of a '2' in the input. Let's check Input_A's second row (121111). There's a '2' in the second position. In Output_A, that '2' becomes '0', and in the first row, the first two digits become '20'. Maybe the rule has to do with a cell adjacent to a '2' being changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a gravity or falling blocks scenario. For example, if a '2' is present, perhaps it \"falls\" down, but only if there's space. Let's see. In Input_A, the second row has a '2' in column 2. In Output_A, the first row's column 1 becomes '2', and the original '2' becomes '0'. So maybe the '2' moved up? That doesn't make sense with gravity. Alternatively, maybe the '2' is converted to '0' and a '2' is added above. But in Input_A, the first row's first two digits are 00, and in Output they become 20. So perhaps the '2' is moving up. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: whenever there is a '2' in a cell, the cell above it (in the previous row, same column) is incremented by 2, and the '2' is replaced with 0. Let's check that.\n\nIn Input_A, the second row has a '2' in column 2. The cell above it is row 1, column 2, which is 0. In Output_A, row 1, column 1 becomes 2 (original was 0), but wait, the 2 is in column 2. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking more carefully. Input_A's first row (001111) and Output_A's first row: 201111. So the first two digits changed from 00 to 20. Wait, perhaps the '2' in the second row's second column (Input_A) is replaced by 0, and the 0 in the first row's first column becomes 2. That seems like a shift left or something. But that might not be systematic.\n\nLet's look at Input_B and Output_B. Input_B is:\n\n0000000000000,\n1100000001000,\n1111000011110,\n1111002111111,\n1111111111111\n\nOutput_B is:\n\n0000000000000,\n1100000001000,\n1111000211110,\n1111000111111,\n1111111111111\n\nSo, let's see the changes. The third row in Input_B is 1111000011110, which in Output_B becomes 1111000211110. The fourth row in Input_B is 1111002111111, which becomes 1111000111111. So, in the fourth row's fifth column (assuming 0-index or 1-index?), the '2' in Input_B becomes 0 in Output_B. And in the third row's fifth column (or sixth?), a '0' becomes '2'. So, perhaps when there's a '2' in a cell, the cell directly above it (previous row) increments by 2 (or becomes 2 if 0), and the '2' is replaced by 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Input_B's fourth row, the fifth column (assuming the '2' is at position 5 in \"1111002111111\"), the '2' is present. In Output_B, that becomes 0. Then, in the third row of Output_B, the same column (if that's the case), the '0' becomes '2'. So that's a possible transfer: moving the '2' up by one row. So when there's a '2' in a cell, it moves up to the cell above, replacing the value (if possible), and the original cell becomes 0. But how does that work?\n\nWait, in Input_A, the '2' is in row 2, column 2. In Output_A, row 1, column 1 becomes 2. Wait, that's a different column. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the '2' is moving left. In Input_A, the '2' is in position (2,2). In Output_A, the '2' appears in position (1,1), and the original becomes 0. That's a diagonal move up-left, which seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nAnother angle: notice that in the Outputs, the '2's are only present in certain positions, perhaps each '2' in the input is replaced by a 0, and a 2 is added to the cell above and/or to the left. Let's check:\n\nIn Input_A, row 2 has a '2' at column 2. In Output_A, row 2's column 2 becomes 0. And then in row 1, column 1 becomes 2 (from 0). So perhaps the '2' from row 2, column 2 is split into two parts: moving to the cell above (row 1, column 2) and the cell to the left (row 2, column 1). But in Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2. Hmm, that's not directly above or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2's are moving up as much as possible. Let's see. In Input_A, the '2' is in row 2 (middle row). If the cell above (row 1, same column) is 0, then the '2' moves up. So row 1, column 2 would get the 2, and the original becomes 0. But in Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2, which is not the same column. So that contradicts.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the transformation involves replacing '2's with '0's and adding '2's to the first possible position in the previous rows. For example, in Input_A, the '2' is in row 2, column 2. The first row's first two columns are 00. Maybe the '2' is added to the earliest possible position (leftmost) in the row above. So, row 1, column 1 becomes 2, and the original '2' becomes 0. That's possible. Let's check for Input_B.\n\nIn Input_B, the '2' is in row 4, column 6 (assuming the part '1111002111111' breaks down as positions 1-7: 1,1,1,1,0,0,2,...). Wait, maybe the positions are 0-based. Let's parse row 4 as:\n\nPositions (0-12): 1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1.\n\nSo the '2' is at column 6 (0-based index 6). In Output_B, the row 4 becomes 1111000111111, so the '2' becomes 0. And in row 3 (the row above), which was originally 1111000011110, in Output_B it's 1111000211110. So the '0' at column 6 becomes '2'. So the '2' in row 4, column 6 moves up to row 3, column 6. That matches the idea that each '2' moves up to the row above, same column, if possible, and the original cell becomes 0.\n\nSimilarly, in Input_A, the '2' is in row 2 (middle row), column 2. So moving it up to row 1, column 2. But in the Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Because according to this rule, the '2' should move up to row 1, column 2. But in Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2, and row 1, column 2 is 0. So perhaps this rule isn't exactly correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the '2' moves up as far as possible, but if the cell above is already occupied (not 0), it moves to the left? Let's check Input_A. The '2' is at row 2, column 2. The cell directly above (row 1, column 2) is 0. So according to the previous rule, the '2' should move up to there. But in Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2. Hmm, that suggests that the movement is not directly vertical. Maybe the '2' moves to the leftmost possible cell in the row above.\n\nWait, in Input_A's row 2, column 2 is 2. The row above (row 1) has columns 0 and 1 as 0,0. So if the '2' is moving up, perhaps it can move to the leftmost available 0 in the row above. So, since the row above (row 1) has columns 1 and 2 as 0 and 0, but in Output_A, row 1's column 1 becomes 2. Wait, perhaps the '2' can move up to the first 0 in the row above, starting from the left.\n\nIn row 1 of Input_A (001111), the first two columns are 0. So the '2' from row 2, column 2 would move up to the first available 0 in row 1. The first available 0 is column 0. So it fills the leftmost 0 in row 1 with 2, and turns the original '2' into 0. But that would mean row 1, column 0 becomes 2, and row 2, column 2 becomes 0. However, in Output_A, row 1 becomes 201111, which is 2 in column 0, 0 in column 1. So the first 0 in row 1 (column 0) is filled with 2. The original '2' in row 2, column 2 becomes 0. Then, what about the other 0 in row 1's column 1? It remains 0. So perhaps the rule is: for each '2' in the input, find the first (leftmost) 0 in the row above, replace that with 2, and set the original '2' to 0.\n\nBut why does in Input_A, the '2' in row 2, column 2 move to row 1, column 0? The row above (row 1) has two 0s in columns 0 and 1. The leftmost is column 0. So the '2' would move there. Then, the row 2, column 2 becomes 0. Let me check:\n\nInput_A row 1: 0 0 1 1 1 1 \u2192 becomes 2 0 1 1 1 1. So yes, first 0 becomes 2, and the rest of the row is same except the next 0 becomes 0. Wait, but that leaves column 1 in row 1 as 0. But why does the second column of row 2 (original '2') become 0? Because after moving up, the original '2' is replaced with 0.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation rule is: For each '2' in the grid, look at the row above (if exists) and find the leftmost '0' in that row. Replace that '0' with '2', and replace the original '2' with '0'. If there are multiple '2's, process them all.\n\nLet's test this with Input_B. The '2' in row 4, column 6 (as per earlier). The row above (row 3) has the row 1111000011110. So looking for the leftmost 0 in row 3. The original row 3 in Input_B is 1111000011110. The leftmost 0 is at position 4 (columns 4 and 5 are zeros, starting from 0). So the leftmost 0 in row 3 is column 4. But wait, in Output_B's row 3, the 0 at position 6 becomes 2. So this contradicts the rule. Wait, maybe the '2' in row 4, column 6 would look at row 3. The leftmost 0 in row 3 is at column 4, but in Output_B, row 3's column 6 is replaced with 2. That suggests that the '2' moves to the same column in the row above, not the leftmost 0. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, in Input_B's row 4, column 6 (let's call it column 6), Output_B's row 3, column 6 is changed from 0 to 2. The '2' from row 4, column 6 moves up to row 3, column 6, and becomes 0 in row 4, column 6. So in that case, the movement is directly upward, same column.\n\nSo then why in Input_A, the '2' in row 2, column 2 moves to row 1, column 0? Because in that case, the row above's column 2 was 1, not 0, so the '2' cannot move up to the same column. Therefore, when moving up, if the same column in the row above is not 0, perhaps the '2' moves to the leftmost available 0 in the row above.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each '2' in the current grid, look at the cell directly above (same column) in the previous row. If that cell is 0, replace it with '2' and set the original '2' to 0. If that cell is not 0, then look for the leftmost 0 in the same row (original '2's row's previous row), and replace that leftmost 0 with '2', then set the original '2' to 0.\n\nLet's apply that to Input_A. The '2' is at row 2, column 2. Row 1, column 2 is 1 (from Input_A's first row: 0,0,1,1,1,1). So same column in row 1 is 1, which is not 0. Therefore, we look for the leftmost 0 in row 1. The leftmost zeros in row 1 are columns 0 and 1. The leftmost is column 0. So replace that 0 with 2, and the original '2' becomes 0. Hence, row 1, column 0 becomes 2, and row 2, column 2 becomes 0. That matches Output_A's first row being 201111 and second row's column 2 being 0 (101111).\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's confirm with Input_B. The '2' is in row 4, column 6. The row above (row 3) has column 6 as 0. So same column in row 3 is 0. So the '2' moves up to row 3, column 6, becomes 2, and the original '2' becomes 0. Hence, in Output_B, row 4's '2' becomes 0, and row 3's column 6 becomes 2. Which matches the given Output_B.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Input_C to find Output_C (MISSING).\n\nInput_C is '000000,011120,111111'.\n\nSplit into rows:\n\nRow 1: 000000\n\nRow 2: 011120\n\nRow 3: 111111\n\nNow, we need to process each '2' in the input. Let's find where the '2' is. In row 2, which is the middle row, the fifth column (assuming 0-based index) is '2'. Let's index the row 2 as 0,1,1,1,2,0? Wait, no, the input is '011120'. So each character is a digit. Let's split row 2: 0,1,1,1,2,0. So '2' is at row 2, column 4 (if columns are 0-based). So in this case, the '2' is at (row 2, column 4).\n\nNow, according to the rule: Check the cell above (row 1, column 4). Row 1 is '000000', so column 4 is 0. Therefore, the same column in the row above is 0. So the '2' can move directly up to row 1, column 4. So in Output_C, row 1's column 4 becomes 2, and the original '2' becomes 0. So row 2's column 4 becomes 0. The rest remains the same.\n\nSo what would the rows look like after transformation?\n\nRow 1: 000000 \u2192 becomes 000020 (since column 4 changes from 0 to 2)\n\nRow 2: 011120 \u2192 becomes 011100 (since column 4's 2 becomes 0)\n\nRow 3: 111111 (unchanged)\n\nSo Output_C should be '000020,011100,111111'. But let me check if there are any other '2's. No, only one '2' in the input.\n\nBut wait, the input row 2 is '011120', so the last digit is 0. So the '2' is in the fifth position (columns 0-5: positions 0,1,2,3,4,5). So row 2, column 4 is '2'. Moving up to row 1, column 4 (which is 0 in input). So row 1 becomes 000020. So the first row becomes '000020', the second row becomes '011100'. Third row remains '111111'.\n\nTherefore, the Output_C would be '000020,011100,111111'.\n\nWait, but the problem says Input_C's Output_C is MISSING. So that's the answer?\n\nBut let me double-check. Let's apply the rule step by step.\n\nOriginal Input_C:\n\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow2: 0 1 1 1 2 0\n\nRow3: 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nProcessing the '2' in row2, column4 (0-based):\n\nCheck row1, column4: it's 0.\n\nSo replace row1, column4 with 2, and set row2, column4 to 0.\n\nSo row1 becomes 0 0 0 0 2 0 \u2192 \"000020\"\n\nRow2 becomes 0 1 1 1 0 0 \u2192 \"011100\"\n\nRow3 remains same.\n\nSo the Output_C would be \"000020,011100,111111\".\n\nBut the problem states Output_C is MISSING, and we need to find that. So according to this, the answer is '000020,011100,111111'.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other '2's in the input that I might have missed. Input_C is '000000,011120,111111'. The third part is '111111' which has no '2's. The second row is '011120', which ends with a '0'. So the '2' is in the fifth position (index 4 if 0-based). Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is '000020,011100,111111', but maybe the order in the output is different? Wait, the Input_A and Input_B's outputs are comma-separated rows, so the order of rows remains the same. So the answer should be as above.\n\nBut let's confirm with another example. For instance, in Input_B, the '2' in row4, column6 (assumed) moves up to row3, column6. So the same column. So the same applies here. The movement is vertical if possible. Here, it's possible, so the '2' moves up. So the answer seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the MISSING value should be '000020,011100,111111'.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The transformation rule involves moving each '2' in the input upward to the same column in the row above if that cell is '0'. If the cell above is not '0', the '2' moves to the leftmost '0' in the same row above. The original '2' becomes '0'. Applying this to Input_C's '2' (row 2, column 4) moves it to row 1, column 4 (which is '0'), resulting in \"000020\" for row1. Row2's '2' becomes '0', leading to \"011100\". Row3 remains unchanged.\n\nAnswer: 000020,011100,111111  \nConfidence: 95%",

  "thinking": "Okay, let's try to figure out this puzzle. So, the problem gives us several inputs and their corresponding outputs and asks us to find the missing output for Input_C. Let's start by analyzing the examples provided to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input to the output.\n\nFirst, looking at Input_A and Output_A. Input_A is '001111,121111,111111', which becomes Output_A '201111,101111,111111'. Let me split these into rows to better visualize them.\n\nInput_A rows:\n1. 001111\n2. 121111\n3. 111111\n\nOutput_A rows:\n1. 201111\n2. 101111\n3. 111111\n\nHmm, what's changing here? Let's look at each position. Starting with the first row of Input_A: 0,0,1,1,1,1. The output is 2,0,1,1,1,1. So the first two digits changed from 00 to 20. The third digit changed from 1 to 1? Wait, no, the third digit was 1 in input and remains 1. Wait, maybe I need to check column-wise instead of row-wise. Let me check the columns. Let's see each column for the three rows.\n\nLooking at the first column across all rows in Input_A:\n0 (from first row), 1 (second row), 1 (third row). In Output_A, the first column becomes 2,1,1. Wait, how? So the first element in the first column changed from 0 to 2. The second row's first element was 1 and became 1. The third row's first element was 1 and stayed 1. That's a bit confusing. Let me check other columns.\n\nSecond column in Input_A: 0 (first row), 2 (second row), 1 (third row). Output_A's second column: 0 (first row), 0 (second row), 1 (third row). So the second row's second element changed from 2 to 0. Third column: in Input_A, all rows have 1 in third column. Output_A remains 1s. Hmm. Maybe looking for some specific patterns, like certain numbers changing based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell is transformed based on some rule. Let's look for cells that changed. In Input_A, the first row's first two digits changed from 00 to 20. The second row's first digit changed from 1 to 1 (no change?), wait no. Wait, the second row's first digit in Input_A is 1, and in Output_A, it's 1. Wait, maybe looking at the cells where the number changed. Let me list the changes:\n\nInput_A to Output_A changes:\n\nRow 1:\n0 \u2192 2 (position 1)\n0 \u2192 0 (position 2)\nOther positions stay 1.\n\nRow 2:\n1 \u2192 1 (no change)\n2 \u2192 0 (position 2)\nOther positions stay 1.\n\nRow 3:\nNo changes.\n\nWait, maybe this is about the presence of a '2' in the input. Let's check Input_A's second row (121111). There's a '2' in the second position. In Output_A, that '2' becomes '0', and in the first row, the first two digits become '20'. Maybe the rule has to do with a cell adjacent to a '2' being changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a gravity or falling blocks scenario. For example, if a '2' is present, perhaps it \"falls\" down, but only if there's space. Let's see. In Input_A, the second row has a '2' in column 2. In Output_A, the first row's column 1 becomes '2', and the original '2' becomes '0'. So maybe the '2' moved up? That doesn't make sense with gravity. Alternatively, maybe the '2' is converted to '0' and a '2' is added above. But in Input_A, the first row's first two digits are 00, and in Output they become 20. So perhaps the '2' is moving up. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: whenever there is a '2' in a cell, the cell above it (in the previous row, same column) is incremented by 2, and the '2' is replaced with 0. Let's check that.\n\nIn Input_A, the second row has a '2' in column 2. The cell above it is row 1, column 2, which is 0. In Output_A, row 1, column 1 becomes 2 (original was 0), but wait, the 2 is in column 2. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking more carefully. Input_A's first row (001111) and Output_A's first row: 201111. So the first two digits changed from 00 to 20. Wait, perhaps the '2' in the second row's second column (Input_A) is replaced by 0, and the 0 in the first row's first column becomes 2. That seems like a shift left or something. But that might not be systematic.\n\nLet's look at Input_B and Output_B. Input_B is:\n\n0000000000000,\n1100000001000,\n1111000011110,\n1111002111111,\n1111111111111\n\nOutput_B is:\n\n0000000000000,\n1100000001000,\n1111000211110,\n1111000111111,\n1111111111111\n\nSo, let's see the changes. The third row in Input_B is 1111000011110, which in Output_B becomes 1111000211110. The fourth row in Input_B is 1111002111111, which becomes 1111000111111. So, in the fourth row's fifth column (assuming 0-index or 1-index?), the '2' in Input_B becomes 0 in Output_B. And in the third row's fifth column (or sixth?), a '0' becomes '2'. So, perhaps when there's a '2' in a cell, the cell directly above it (previous row) increments by 2 (or becomes 2 if 0), and the '2' is replaced by 0. Let's check.\n\nIn Input_B's fourth row, the fifth column (assuming the '2' is at position 5 in \"1111002111111\"), the '2' is present. In Output_B, that becomes 0. Then, in the third row of Output_B, the same column (if that's the case), the '0' becomes '2'. So that's a possible transfer: moving the '2' up by one row. So when there's a '2' in a cell, it moves up to the cell above, replacing the value (if possible), and the original cell becomes 0. But how does that work?\n\nWait, in Input_A, the '2' is in row 2, column 2. In Output_A, row 1, column 1 becomes 2. Wait, that's a different column. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the '2' is moving left. In Input_A, the '2' is in position (2,2). In Output_A, the '2' appears in position (1,1), and the original becomes 0. That's a diagonal move up-left, which seems less likely. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nAnother angle: notice that in the Outputs, the '2's are only present in certain positions, perhaps each '2' in the input is replaced by a 0, and a 2 is added to the cell above and/or to the left. Let's check:\n\nIn Input_A, row 2 has a '2' at column 2. In Output_A, row 2's column 2 becomes 0. And then in row 1, column 1 becomes 2 (from 0). So perhaps the '2' from row 2, column 2 is split into two parts: moving to the cell above (row 1, column 2) and the cell to the left (row 2, column 1). But in Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2. Hmm, that's not directly above or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '2's are moving up as much as possible. Let's see. In Input_A, the '2' is in row 2 (middle row). If the cell above (row 1, same column) is 0, then the '2' moves up. So row 1, column 2 would get the 2, and the original becomes 0. But in Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2, which is not the same column. So that contradicts.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the transformation involves replacing '2's with '0's and adding '2's to the first possible position in the previous rows. For example, in Input_A, the '2' is in row 2, column 2. The first row's first two columns are 00. Maybe the '2' is added to the earliest possible position (leftmost) in the row above. So, row 1, column 1 becomes 2, and the original '2' becomes 0. That's possible. Let's check for Input_B.\n\nIn Input_B, the '2' is in row 4, column 6 (assuming the part '1111002111111' breaks down as positions 1-7: 1,1,1,1,0,0,2,...). Wait, maybe the positions are 0-based. Let's parse row 4 as:\n\nPositions (0-12): 1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1.\n\nSo the '2' is at column 6 (0-based index 6). In Output_B, the row 4 becomes 1111000111111, so the '2' becomes 0. And in row 3 (the row above), which was originally 1111000011110, in Output_B it's 1111000211110. So the '0' at column 6 becomes '2'. So the '2' in row 4, column 6 moves up to row 3, column 6. That matches the idea that each '2' moves up to the row above, same column, if possible, and the original cell becomes 0.\n\nSimilarly, in Input_A, the '2' is in row 2 (middle row), column 2. So moving it up to row 1, column 2. But in the Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Because according to this rule, the '2' should move up to row 1, column 2. But in Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2, and row 1, column 2 is 0. So perhaps this rule isn't exactly correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the '2' moves up as far as possible, but if the cell above is already occupied (not 0), it moves to the left? Let's check Input_A. The '2' is at row 2, column 2. The cell directly above (row 1, column 2) is 0. So according to the previous rule, the '2' should move up to there. But in Output_A, row 1, column 1 is 2. Hmm, that suggests that the movement is not directly vertical. Maybe the '2' moves to the leftmost possible cell in the row above.\n\nWait, in Input_A's row 2, column 2 is 2. The row above (row 1) has columns 0 and 1 as 0,0. So if the '2' is moving up, perhaps it can move to the leftmost available 0 in the row above. So, since the row above (row 1) has columns 1 and 2 as 0 and 0, but in Output_A, row 1's column 1 becomes 2. Wait, perhaps the '2' can move up to the first 0 in the row above, starting from the left.\n\nIn row 1 of Input_A (001111), the first two columns are 0. So the '2' from row 2, column 2 would move up to the first available 0 in row 1. The first available 0 is column 0. So it fills the leftmost 0 in row 1 with 2, and turns the original '2' into 0. But that would mean row 1, column 0 becomes 2, and row 2, column 2 becomes 0. However, in Output_A, row 1 becomes 201111, which is 2 in column 0, 0 in column 1. So the first 0 in row 1 (column 0) is filled with 2. The original '2' in row 2, column 2 becomes 0. Then, what about the other 0 in row 1's column 1? It remains 0. So perhaps the rule is: for each '2' in the input, find the first (leftmost) 0 in the row above, replace that with 2, and set the original '2' to 0.\n\nBut why does in Input_A, the '2' in row 2, column 2 move to row 1, column 0? The row above (row 1) has two 0s in columns 0 and 1. The leftmost is column 0. So the '2' would move there. Then, the row 2, column 2 becomes 0. Let me check:\n\nInput_A row 1: 0 0 1 1 1 1 \u2192 becomes 2 0 1 1 1 1. So yes, first 0 becomes 2, and the rest of the row is same except the next 0 becomes 0. Wait, but that leaves column 1 in row 1 as 0. But why does the second column of row 2 (original '2') become 0? Because after moving up, the original '2' is replaced with 0.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation rule is: For each '2' in the grid, look at the row above (if exists) and find the leftmost '0' in that row. Replace that '0' with '2', and replace the original '2' with '0'. If there are multiple '2's, process them all.\n\nLet's test this with Input_B. The '2' in row 4, column 6 (as per earlier). The row above (row 3) has the row 1111000011110. So looking for the leftmost 0 in row 3. The original row 3 in Input_B is 1111000011110. The leftmost 0 is at position 4 (columns 4 and 5 are zeros, starting from 0). So the leftmost 0 in row 3 is column 4. But wait, in Output_B's row 3, the 0 at position 6 becomes 2. So this contradicts the rule. Wait, maybe the '2' in row 4, column 6 would look at row 3. The leftmost 0 in row 3 is at column 4, but in Output_B, row 3's column 6 is replaced with 2. That suggests that the '2' moves to the same column in the row above, not the leftmost 0. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nWait, in Input_B's row 4, column 6 (let's call it column 6), Output_B's row 3, column 6 is changed from 0 to 2. The '2' from row 4, column 6 moves up to row 3, column 6, and becomes 0 in row 4, column 6. So in that case, the movement is directly upward, same column.\n\nSo then why in Input_A, the '2' in row 2, column 2 moves to row 1, column 0? Because in that case, the row above's column 2 was 1, not 0, so the '2' cannot move up to the same column. Therefore, when moving up, if the same column in the row above is not 0, perhaps the '2' moves to the leftmost available 0 in the row above.\n\nSo the rule could be: For each '2' in the current grid, look at the cell directly above (same column) in the previous row. If that cell is 0, replace it with '2' and set the original '2' to 0. If that cell is not 0, then look for the leftmost 0 in the same row (original '2's row's previous row), and replace that leftmost 0 with '2', then set the original '2' to 0.\n\nLet's apply that to Input_A. The '2' is at row 2, column 2. Row 1, column 2 is 1 (from Input_A's first row: 0,0,1,1,1,1). So same column in row 1 is 1, which is not 0. Therefore, we look for the leftmost 0 in row 1. The leftmost zeros in row 1 are columns 0 and 1. The leftmost is column 0. So replace that 0 with 2, and the original '2' becomes 0. Hence, row 1, column 0 becomes 2, and row 2, column 2 becomes 0. That matches Output_A's first row being 201111 and second row's column 2 being 0 (101111).\n\nThis seems to fit. Let's confirm with Input_B. The '2' is in row 4, column 6. The row above (row 3) has column 6 as 0. So same column in row 3 is 0. So the '2' moves up to row 3, column 6, becomes 2, and the original '2' becomes 0. Hence, in Output_B, row 4's '2' becomes 0, and row 3's column 6 becomes 2. Which matches the given Output_B.\n\nNow, applying this rule to Input_C to find Output_C (MISSING).\n\nInput_C is '000000,011120,111111'.\n\nSplit into rows:\n\nRow 1: 000000\n\nRow 2: 011120\n\nRow 3: 111111\n\nNow, we need to process each '2' in the input. Let's find where the '2' is. In row 2, which is the middle row, the fifth column (assuming 0-based index) is '2'. Let's index the row 2 as 0,1,1,1,2,0? Wait, no, the input is '011120'. So each character is a digit. Let's split row 2: 0,1,1,1,2,0. So '2' is at row 2, column 4 (if columns are 0-based). So in this case, the '2' is at (row 2, column 4).\n\nNow, according to the rule: Check the cell above (row 1, column 4). Row 1 is '000000', so column 4 is 0. Therefore, the same column in the row above is 0. So the '2' can move directly up to row 1, column 4. So in Output_C, row 1's column 4 becomes 2, and the original '2' becomes 0. So row 2's column 4 becomes 0. The rest remains the same.\n\nSo what would the rows look like after transformation?\n\nRow 1: 000000 \u2192 becomes 000020 (since column 4 changes from 0 to 2)\n\nRow 2: 011120 \u2192 becomes 011100 (since column 4's 2 becomes 0)\n\nRow 3: 111111 (unchanged)\n\nSo Output_C should be '000020,011100,111111'. But let me check if there are any other '2's. No, only one '2' in the input.\n\nBut wait, the input row 2 is '011120', so the last digit is 0. So the '2' is in the fifth position (columns 0-5: positions 0,1,2,3,4,5). So row 2, column 4 is '2'. Moving up to row 1, column 4 (which is 0 in input). So row 1 becomes 000020. So the first row becomes '000020', the second row becomes '011100'. Third row remains '111111'.\n\nTherefore, the Output_C would be '000020,011100,111111'.\n\nWait, but the problem says Input_C's Output_C is MISSING. So that's the answer?\n\nBut let me double-check. Let's apply the rule step by step.\n\nOriginal Input_C:\n\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow2: 0 1 1 1 2 0\n\nRow3: 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nProcessing the '2' in row2, column4 (0-based):\n\nCheck row1, column4: it's 0.\n\nSo replace row1, column4 with 2, and set row2, column4 to 0.\n\nSo row1 becomes 0 0 0 0 2 0 \u2192 \"000020\"\n\nRow2 becomes 0 1 1 1 0 0 \u2192 \"011100\"\n\nRow3 remains same.\n\nSo the Output_C would be \"000020,011100,111111\".\n\nBut the problem states Output_C is MISSING, and we need to find that. So according to this, the answer is '000020,011100,111111'.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other '2's in the input that I might have missed. Input_C is '000000,011120,111111'. The third part is '111111' which has no '2's. The second row is '011120', which ends with a '0'. So the '2' is in the fifth position (index 4 if 0-based). Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is '000020,011100,111111', but maybe the order in the output is different? Wait, the Input_A and Input_B's outputs are comma-separated rows, so the order of rows remains the same. So the answer should be as above.\n\nBut let's confirm with another example. For instance, in Input_B, the '2' in row4, column6 (assumed) moves up to row3, column6. So the same column. So the same applies here. The movement is vertical if possible. Here, it's possible, so the '2' moves up. So the answer seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the MISSING value should be '000020,011100,111111'.",
