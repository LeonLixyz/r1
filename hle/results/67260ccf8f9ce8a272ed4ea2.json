  "question": "Starting with a single stick of unit length, a point $p \\in (0, 1)$ is picked uniformly at random along the stick and the stick is snapped, producing two sticks of length $p$ and $1-p$.\n\nAt each next stage, a stick is picked uniformly at random, and a point is picked uniformly at random along the length of that stick, and it is snapped.\n\n**Question:** After n snaps, what is the order of the expected length of the longest remaining stick? Your answer should be in the form of $n^s$ for some real $s$.",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the expected length of the longest remaining stick after n snaps. Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the process begins with one stick of length 1. Each time we snap a stick, we choose one stick uniformly at random and snap it at a uniformly random point, resulting in two sticks. After n snaps, there are n+1 sticks. The question is about the order of the expected length of the longest stick in terms of n, expressed as n^s for some exponent s.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how this process works. Each snap breaks one stick into two parts. The key here is to model how the lengths evolve over each snap. Maybe I can approach this by considering the expectation after each step.\n\nInitially, before any snaps, the longest stick is length 1. After the first snap, we have two sticks of lengths p and 1-p. Since p is uniformly distributed in (0,1), the expected maximum length here would be the expectation of max(p, 1-p). The maximum of p and 1-p when p is uniform is known. Since for p ~ U(0,1), the maximum is always greater than or equal to 1/2. The expected value of max(p, 1-p) is 3/4. Wait, let me verify that. If p is uniform, then the distribution of max(p, 1-p) is symmetric around 1/2. So for p in [0, 1/2], the max is 1-p, which ranges from 1 to 1/2. For p in [1/2, 1], the max is p. So the expected value would be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of (1 - p) dp plus the integral from 1/2 to 1 of p dp. Let's compute that:\n\nFirst integral: integral from 0 to 0.5 of (1 - p) dp = [p - (p^2)/2] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5 - 0.125) - 0 = 0.375\n\nSecond integral: integral from 0.5 to 1 of p dp = [ (p^2)/2 ] from 0.5 to 1 = (0.5 - 0.125) = 0.375\n\nTotal expected max after first snap: 0.375 + 0.375 = 0.75. So 3/4. So after first snap, expectation is 3/4.\n\nNow, moving to the next snap. At the second step, we have two sticks. We choose one uniformly at random (each has probability 1/2) to snap. Suppose we have sticks of lengths a and b. Let's assume the first stick was broken into a and 1-a. So after the first snap, the two sticks are of lengths 3/4 on average? Wait, no, the actual lengths depend on p. But in expectation, the max is 3/4, but each time, the next step depends on which stick is chosen. Hmm, maybe I need to model this recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's see. After each snap, when we break a stick, the new sticks are going to have lengths that are fractions of the original stick. Let's consider that each time a stick is broken, the maximum length in the system might decrease in expectation.\n\nBut I need to find the expected maximum after n snaps. Let's think recursively. Let E(k) be the expected maximum length after k snaps. We start with E(0) = 1.\n\nAfter the first snap, E(1) = 3/4, as computed.\n\nFor the second snap, we have two sticks. Let's suppose the lengths are L1 and L2, which after the first break are random variables. The next step is to choose one of the two sticks uniformly at random (each with probability 1/2) and break it. When we break a stick of length L, the expected maximum of the two resulting pieces is (3/4)L, similar to the first step. Because breaking a stick of length L gives two pieces with expected maximum (3/4)L. So, perhaps the expected maximum after each break can be modeled as the previous maximum times 3/4, but this seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think. Suppose after the first snap, the two sticks are of lengths p and 1-p. Then, in expectation, the maximum is 3/4. Now, for the second snap, we pick one of the two sticks at random. If we pick the longer one (which is of length max(p, 1-p)) and break it, then the new maximum would be the maximum between the unbroken stick and the maximum of the broken pieces. But if we break the shorter one, then the maximum remains the original longer one. However, since we are choosing the stick uniformly at random, not based on their lengths, we have a 50% chance to break either stick.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's model this step by step. When we have multiple sticks, each subsequent break is done by first selecting a stick uniformly at random (i.e., each stick has equal probability of being chosen regardless of length) and then breaking it at a uniformly random point. So, each time we perform a snap, the chosen stick's length is, say, L. Then, the expected maximum of the two new pieces is (3/4)L. But the other sticks remain as they are.\n\nHowever, the overall maximum after the snap would be the maximum between the previous maximum (among the other sticks) and the maximum of the two new pieces. Wait, but if the original stick was part of the previous maximum, then breaking it might reduce the maximum. Alternatively, if we break a stick that is not the current maximum, then the maximum remains, unless the new pieces from the broken non-max stick are larger than the current maximum, which is impossible since the non-max stick was already smaller. So, breaking a non-max stick can't increase the maximum. Breaking the max stick can potentially reduce the maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps the key idea is that each time we break a stick, if that stick was the current maximum, then the new maximum is (3/4)L, where L was the previous maximum. Otherwise, the maximum remains the same. So, the expected maximum after each snap is the previous maximum multiplied by the probability that we broke the maximum stick times (3/4) plus the probability that we didn't break the maximum stick times the original maximum.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague. Let's formalize it.\n\nSuppose that after k snaps, there are k+1 sticks. Let M_k be the expected maximum length. When we perform the (k+1)-th snap, we select a stick uniformly at random from the k+1 sticks. The probability that we select the current maximum stick is 1/(k+1) (assuming there's only one maximum stick; but perhaps multiple sticks could have the maximum length? Hmm, in expectation, but maybe the process leads to a unique maximum. Not sure, but perhaps we can model it as a single maximum for approximation.)\n\nIf we break the maximum stick (probability 1/(k+1)), then the new maximum would be the max between the other sticks and the new pieces from the broken maximum. The new pieces from breaking the maximum stick, which was of length M_k, will have an expected maximum of (3/4)M_k. So, the new expected maximum in this case would be the maximum between the remaining sticks (which are all less than or equal to M_k) and (3/4)M_k. Therefore, the new maximum would be (3/4)M_k, since the remaining sticks are all <= M_k.\n\nIf we break a non-maximum stick (probability k/(k+1)), then the maximum remains M_k, because breaking a smaller stick can't produce a piece larger than the existing maximum.\n\nTherefore, the recursion would be:\n\nM_{k+1} = (1/(k+1)) * (3/4 M_k) + (k/(k+1)) * M_k\n\nSimplifying:\n\nM_{k+1} = [ (3/4) + k ] / (k+1) ) * M_k\n\nWhich is:\n\nM_{k+1} = [ (3/4 + k) / (k+1) ) ] * M_k\n\nSimplify the numerator: k + 3/4 = (4k + 3)/4\n\nSo:\n\nM_{k+1} = (4k + 3)/(4(k + 1)) * M_k\n\nSo, M_{k+1} = ( (4k + 3)/4(k + 1) ) * M_k\n\nHmm. Let's compute this recursion. Starting with M_0 = 1.\n\nM_1 = (4*0 + 3)/(4*(0 + 1)) ) * M_0 = 3/4 * 1 = 3/4. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nM_2 = (4*1 + 3)/(4*2) * M_1 = 7/8 * 3/4 = 21/32 \u2248 0.65625\n\nM_3 = (4*2 + 3)/(4*3) * M_2 = 11/12 * 21/32 = 231/384 \u2248 0.60156\n\nWait, so each time, we multiply by a factor that's approaching (k + something)/k+1, but let's see if this product can be represented in terms of a product formula.\n\nWe can write M_n as the product from k=0 to n-1 of (4k + 3)/(4(k + 1)).\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as product_{k=0}^{n-1} ( (4k + 3) / (4(k+1)) )\n\nLet me see. Let's try to write it in terms of Gamma functions or something. The product term:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{n-1} (4k + 3) / (4(k + 1)) ) = Product_{k=0}^{n-1} ( (k + 3/4) ) / (k + 1) ) * 4/4 ?\n\nWait, 4k + 3 = 4(k + 3/4). So:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{n-1} [4(k + 3/4) / 4(k + 1)) ] = Product_{k=0}^{n-1} ( (k + 3/4) / (k + 1) )\n\nTherefore:\n\nM_n = Product_{k=0}^{n-1} (k + 3/4) / (k + 1)\n\nWhich is equal to [ Gamma(n + 3/4) / Gamma(3/4) ) ] / [ Gamma(n + 1) / Gamma(1) ) ].\n\nBecause the product of terms (k + a) from k=0 to n-1 is equal to Gamma(n + a)/Gamma(a). So,\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{n-1} (k + 3/4) = Gamma(n + 3/4)/Gamma(3/4)\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{n-1} (k + 1) = Gamma(n + 1)/Gamma(1) = n! since Gamma(1)=1.\n\nThus, M_n = [ Gamma(n + 3/4) / Gamma(3/4) ) ] / [ Gamma(n + 1) ) ] = [ Gamma(n + 3/4) ] / [ Gamma(3/4) Gamma(n + 1) )\n\nAlternatively, using properties of the Gamma function, we can write this ratio in terms of Beta functions or perhaps use Stirling's approximation for Gamma functions.\n\nWe need to find the asymptotic behavior of M_n as n becomes large. So, using Stirling's formula for Gamma(z):\n\nGamma(z) \u2248 sqrt(2 pi) z^{z - 1/2} e^{-z} for large z.\n\nSo, Gamma(n + 3/4) \u2248 sqrt(2 pi) (n + 3/4)^{n + 3/4 - 1/2} e^{-(n + 3/4)} = sqrt(2 pi) (n + 3/4)^{n + 1/4} e^{-n - 3/4}\n\nGamma(n + 1) \u2248 sqrt(2 pi) (n + 1)^{n + 1 - 1/2} e^{-(n + 1)} = sqrt(2 pi) (n + 1)^{n + 1/2} e^{-n -1}\n\nTherefore, Gamma(n + 3/4)/Gamma(n + 1) \u2248 [ sqrt(2 pi) (n + 3/4)^{n + 1/4} e^{-n -3/4} ] / [ sqrt(2 pi) (n +1)^{n +1/2} e^{-n -1} } ]\n\nCancel the sqrt(2 pi):\n\n= [ (n + 3/4)^{n +1/4} / (n +1)^{n +1/2} ) ] * e^{ -3/4 +1 }\n\nSimplify the exponential: e^{1/4}\n\nSo, = e^{1/4} * [ (n + 3/4)^{n +1/4} / (n +1)^{n +1/2} ) ]\n\nLet me write (n + 3/4) as (n +1) - 1/4. Let's factor out (n +1) from both numerator and denominator.\n\n= e^{1/4} * [ ( (n +1) - 1/4 )^{n +1/4} / (n +1)^{n +1/2} ) ]\n\n= e^{1/4} * (n +1)^{n +1/4} * (1 - 1/(4(n +1)))^{n +1/4} / (n +1)^{n +1/2} )\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n(n +1)^{n +1/4 - (n +1/2)} ) = (n +1)^{-1/4}\n\nSo, = e^{1/4} * (n +1)^{-1/4} * (1 - 1/(4(n +1)))^{n +1/4}\n\nNow, for large n, (1 - 1/(4(n+1)))^{n +1/4} \u2248 e^{ - (1/(4(n+1))) * (n +1/4) ) } = e^{ - (n +1/4)/(4(n+1)) } \u2248 e^{- 1/4 * (1 - (3/4)/(n+1)) } \u2248 e^{-1/4} * e^{ (3/16(n+1)) } \u2248 e^{-1/4} (since the second term tends to 1 as n grows)\n\nThus, combining everything:\n\n\u2248 e^{1/4} * (n +1)^{-1/4} * e^{-1/4} } = (n +1)^{-1/4} \u2248 n^{-1/4}\n\nTherefore, Gamma(n + 3/4)/Gamma(n +1) \u2248 n^{-1/4} / some constant factors. Wait, but the exact asymptotic behavior is n^{-1/4} ?\n\nBut then M_n = [Gamma(n +3/4)/(Gamma(3/4) Gamma(n+1))] \u2248 C * n^{-1/4}\n\nSo the leading term is n^{-1/4}, meaning that the expected maximum length after n snaps is of order n^{-1/4}, so the answer would be n^{-1/4}, which is n^{-0.25}. So the order is O(n^{-1/4}), so the expected longest stick is \u0398(n^{-1/4}).\n\nTherefore, the exponent s is -1/4. But the question asks for the order in terms of n^s, so the answer should be n^{-1/4}, which would be written as \\boxed{n^{-1/4}}.\n\nWait, but let me check if my calculations are correct. Let me go back through the steps.\n\nWe started with M_{k+1} = [(4k + 3)/(4(k+1)))] M_k. This recursion leads to M_n being a product of terms (4k + 3)/(4(k +1)) from k=0 to n-1. Then, by expressing this product in terms of Gamma functions and using Stirling's approximation, we found that M_n decays as n^{-1/4}.\n\nYes, this seems right. So the expected length of the longest stick after n snaps is proportional to n^{-1/4}, so the order is \u0398(n^{-1/4}).\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The problem involves repeatedly snapping sticks and determining the expected length of the longest remaining stick after \\(n\\) snaps. Each snap breaks a uniformly selected stick at a random point, reducing its length into two parts. The key insight is that breaking the current longest stick (with probability decreasing as \\(1/(k+1)\\) at step \\(k\\)) reduces the maximum length by a factor of \\(3/4\\). Using a recursive relation and analyzing the product of terms using properties of the Gamma function and Stirling's approximation, the expected maximum length scales asymptotically as \\(n^{-1/4}\\). \n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{n^{-1/4}}\\)\n\nConfidence: 95%",

Maybe I can approach this by considering the expectation after each step.\n\nInitially, before any snaps, the longest stick is length 1. After the first snap, we have two sticks of lengths p and 1-p. Since p is uniformly distributed in (0,1), the expected maximum length here would be the expectation of max(p, 1-p). The maximum of p and 1-p when p is uniform is known. Since for p ~ U(0,1), the maximum is always greater than or equal to 1/2. The expected value of max(p, 1-p) is 3/4. Wait, let me verify that. If p is uniform, then the distribution of max(p, 1-p) is symmetric around 1/2. So for p in [0, 1/2], the max is 1-p, which ranges from 1 to 1/2. For p in [1/2, 1], the max is p. So the expected value would be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of (1 - p) dp plus the integral from 1/2 to 1 of p dp. Let's compute that:\n\nFirst integral: integral from 0 to 0.5 of (1 - p) dp = [p - (p^2)/2] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5 - 0.125) - 0 = 0.375\n\nSecond integral: integral from 0.5 to 1 of p dp = [ (p^2)/2 ] from 0.5 to 1 = (0.5 - 0.125) = 0.375\n\nTotal expected max after first snap: 0.375 + 0.375 = 0.75. So 3/4. So after first snap, expectation is 3/4.\n\nNow, moving to the next snap. At the second step, we have two sticks. We choose one uniformly at random (each has probability 1/2) to snap. Suppose we have sticks of lengths a and b. Let's assume the first stick was broken into a and 1-a. So after the first snap, the two sticks are of lengths 3/4 on average?

Let E(k) be the expected maximum length after k snaps. We start with E(0) = 1.\n\nAfter the first snap, E(1) = 3/4, as computed.\n\nFor the second snap, we have two sticks. Let's suppose the lengths are L1 and L2, which after the first break are random variables. The next step is to choose one of the two sticks uniformly at random (each with probability 1/2) and break it. When we break a stick of length L, the expected maximum of the two resulting pieces is (3/4)L, similar to the first step.

When we perform the (k+1)-th snap, we select a stick uniformly at random from the k+1 sticks. The probability that we select the current maximum stick is 1/(k+1) (assuming there's only one maximum stick; but perhaps multiple sticks could have the maximum length? Hmm, in expectation, but maybe the process leads to a unique maximum. Not sure, but perhaps we can model it as a single maximum for approximation.)\n\nIf we break the maximum stick (probability 1/(k+1)), then the new maximum would be the max between the other sticks and the new pieces from the broken maximum. The new pieces from breaking the maximum stick, which was of length M_k, will have an expected maximum of (3/4)M_k. So, the new expected maximum in this case would be the maximum between the remaining sticks (which are all less than or equal to M_k) and (3/4)M_k. Therefore, the new maximum would be (3/4)M_k, since the remaining sticks are all <= M_k.\n\nIf we break a non-maximum stick (probability k/(k+1)), then the maximum remains M_k, because breaking a smaller stick can't produce a piece larger than the existing maximum.\n\nTherefore, the recursion would be:\n\nM_{k+1} = (1/(k+1)) * (3/4 M_k) + (k/(k+1)) * M_k\n\nSimplifying:\n\nM_{k+1} = [ (3/4) + k ] / (k+1) ) * M_k\n\nWhich is:\n\nM_{k+1} = [ (3/4 + k) / (k+1) ) ] * M_k\n\nSimplify the numerator: k + 3/4 = (4k + 3)/4\n\nSo:\n\nM_{k+1} = (4k + 3)/(4(k + 1)) * M_k\n\nSo, M_{k+1} = ( (4k + 3)/4(k + 1) ) * M_k\n\nHmm. Let's compute this recursion. Starting with M_0 = 1.\n\nM_1 = (4*0 + 3)/(4*(0 + 1)) ) * M_0 = 3/4 * 1 = 3/4.

So, using Stirling's formula for Gamma(z):\n\nGamma(z) \u2248 sqrt(2 pi) z^{z - 1/2} e^{-z} for large z.\n\nSo, Gamma(n + 3/4) \u2248 sqrt(2 pi) (n + 3/4)^{n + 3/4 - 1/2} e^{-(n + 3/4)} = sqrt(2 pi) (n + 3/4)^{n + 1/4} e^{-n - 3/4}\n\nGamma(n + 1) \u2248 sqrt(2 pi) (n + 1)^{n + 1 - 1/2} e^{-(n + 1)} = sqrt(2 pi) (n + 1)^{n + 1/2} e^{-n -1}\n\nTherefore, Gamma(n + 3/4)/Gamma(n + 1) \u2248 [ sqrt(2 pi) (n + 3/4)^{n + 1/4} e^{-n -3/4} ] / [ sqrt(2 pi) (n +1)^{n +1/2} e^{-n -1} } ]\n\nCancel the sqrt(2 pi):\n\n= [ (n + 3/4)^{n +1/4} / (n +1)^{n +1/2} ) ] * e^{ -3/4 +1 }\n\nSimplify the exponential: e^{1/4}\n\nSo, = e^{1/4} * [ (n + 3/4)^{n +1/4} / (n +1)^{n +1/2} ) ]\n\nLet me write (n + 3/4) as (n +1) - 1/4. Let's factor out (n +1) from both numerator and denominator.\n\n= e^{1/4} * [ ( (n +1) - 1/4 )^{n +1/4} / (n +1)^{n +1/2} ) ]\n\n= e^{1/4} * (n +1)^{n +1/4} * (1 - 1/(4(n +1)))^{n +1/4} / (n +1)^{n +1/2} )\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n(n +1)^{n +1/4 - (n +1/2)} ) = (n +1)^{-1/4}\n\nSo, = e^{1/4} * (n +1)^{-1/4} * (1 - 1/(4(n +1)))^{n +1/4}\n\nNow, for large n, (1 - 1/(4(n+1)))^{n +1/4} \u2248 e^{ - (1/(4(n+1))) * (n +1/4) ) } = e^{ - (n +1/4)/(4(n+1)) } \u2248 e^{- 1/4 * (1 - (3/4)/(n+1)) } \u2248 e^{-1/4} * e^{ (3/16(n+1)) } \u2248 e^{-1/4} (since the second term tends to 1 as n grows)\n\nThus, combining everything:\n\n\u2248 e^{1/4} * (n +1)^{-1/4} * e^{-1/4} } = (n +1)^{-1/4} \u2248 n^{-1/4}\n\nTherefore, Gamma(n + 3/4)/Gamma(n +1) \u2248 n^{-1/4} / some constant factors. Wait, but the exact asymptotic behavior is n^{-1/4} ?\n\nBut then M_n = [Gamma(n +3/4)/(Gamma(3/4) Gamma(n+1))] \u2248 C * n^{-1/4}\n\nSo the leading term is n^{-1/4}, meaning that the expected maximum length after n snaps is of order n^{-1/4}, so the answer would be n^{-1/4}, which is n^{-0.25}. So the order is O(n^{-1/4}), so the expected longest stick is \u0398(n^{-1/4}).\n\nTherefore, the exponent s is -1/4. But the question asks for the order in terms of n^s, so the answer should be n^{-1/4}, which would be written as \\boxed{n^{-1/4}}.\n\nWait, but let me check if my calculations are correct. Let me go back through the steps.\n\nWe started with M_{k+1} = [(4k + 3)/(4(k+1)))] M_k. This recursion leads to M_n being a product of terms (4k + 3)/(4(k +1)) from k=0 to n-1. Then, by expressing this product in terms of Gamma functions and using Stirling's approximation, we found that M_n decays as n^{-1/4}.\n\nYes, this seems right. So the expected length of the longest stick after n snaps is proportional to n^{-1/4}, so the order is \u0398(n^{-1/4}).",
