  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic concepts here. \n\nFirst, Dirichlet characters are functions that arise in number theory, particularly in the context of Dirichlet L-functions. A Dirichlet character modulo n is called primitive if it cannot be induced by any character modulo a proper divisor of n. The conductor of a character is the modulus of the associated primitive character. So, in this case, since the conductor is given as 53599, that means we're looking for primitive characters modulo 53599.\n\nThe order of a character is the smallest positive integer k such that \u03c7^k is the trivial character. So, an order 6 character means that \u03c7^6 is trivial, and there's no smaller positive integer than 6 with that property. Therefore, the character must have multiplicative order 6 in the group of Dirichlet characters modulo 53599.\n\nNow, the key steps here are to determine the structure of the multiplicative group modulo 53599, because the number of primitive characters of a given order depends on the structure of this group. The number of primitive characters of conductor d and order m is equal to \u03c6(m) multiplied by the number of primitive multiplicative characters of order m modulo d. Wait, actually, I need to be careful here. Let me think again.\n\nThe conductor d must be equal to the modulus here since the characters are primitive. So, modulus and conductor are the same. For the character to be primitive, the modulus cannot be reduced. Therefore, the modulus is 53599, which is prime? Wait, let me check if 53599 is a prime number. If not, its factorization will matter because the structure of the multiplicative group modulo d depends on whether d is prime, a prime power, or composite.\n\nWait, let's factorize 53599. Let me try dividing by small primes. First, check if it's even: 53599 is odd. Sum of digits: 5+3+5+9+9 = 31, which isn't divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3. Next, test 5: last digit is 9, so no. Then 7: 53599 \u00f77. Let's compute 7*7657 = 53599? 7*7000=49000, 7*600=4200, 7*57=399. So 7000+600+57=7657. 7*7657: 49000 + 4200=53200, plus 399=53599. Yes! So 53599 =7*7657. Wait, but 7657 needs to be checked if it's prime. Let me check 7657. Divided by 7: 7*1000=7000, 7657-7000=657. 657 \u00f77=93.857\u2026 Not integer. Next, 11: 7657. 11*696 = 7656, so 7657-7656=1. Not divisible by 11. 13: 13*589=7657? 13*500=6500, 13*80=1040, 13*9=117. 6500+1040=7540+117=7657. Yes! So 7657=13*589. Now check if 589 is prime. 589 divided by 17: 17*34=578, 589-578=11. Not divisible. 19: 19*31=589? 19*30=570, 19*1=19. 570+19=589. Yes! So 589=19*31. Therefore, the prime factorization of 53599 is 7*13*19*31. All primes here.\n\nSo, d=53599 factors into distinct primes: 7, 13, 19, 31. Since these are distinct primes, the modulus is square-free. For a square-free modulus, the multiplicative group modulo d is isomorphic to the product of the multiplicative groups modulo each prime factor. That is, (Z/dZ)^* \u2245 (Z/7Z)^* \u00d7 (Z/13Z)^* \u00d7 (Z/19Z)^* \u00d7 (Z/31Z)^*. Each of these factors is cyclic because the multiplicative group modulo a prime is cyclic. Therefore, the entire group is isomorphic to the product of cyclic groups of orders 6, 12, 18, and 30, respectively. Wait, let's check:\n\nFor primes p, (Z/pZ)^* is cyclic of order p-1. So:\n\n- For p=7: order 6\n- p=13: order 12\n- p=19: order 18\n- p=31: order 30\n\nTherefore, the group (Z/53599Z)^* is isomorphic to C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30, where Ck denotes a cyclic group of order k. \n\nNow, the group of Dirichlet characters modulo d is isomorphic to the dual group of (Z/dZ)^*, which for finite abelian groups is isomorphic to the group itself. Therefore, the group of characters is also isomorphic to C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30. \n\nBut we are looking for primitive characters of order 6. Now, a primitive character modulo d is one that cannot be induced by a character modulo a proper divisor of d. However, since d is square-free, any primitive character modulo d is equivalent to a character whose modulus is d, and the primitive characters correspond to characters that are nontrivial on each component (since d is square-free). Wait, actually, when the modulus is square-free, a character is primitive if and only if it is nontrivial on each prime component. Because if a character were trivial on one prime component, then it could be considered as a character modulo the product of the other primes, which is a proper divisor. Therefore, the primitive characters modulo square-free d are those that are nontrivial on each prime factor. \n\nTherefore, in the group of characters, which is the product of the character groups for each prime component, the primitive characters correspond to characters where each component character is non-trivial. Therefore, the number of primitive characters would be the product over each prime factor of (number of non-trivial characters for that component). Wait, but perhaps more accurately, since the group of characters modulo d is the product of the character groups modulo each prime power in the factorization. But since d is square-free, each component is modulo a prime. Thus, the primitive characters are exactly those that are nontrivial on each component. So, the total number of primitive characters would be the product over each prime p dividing d of (\u03c6(p) - 1), but wait. Wait, for each prime p, the number of characters modulo p is \u03c6(p) = p-1. However, when considering primitive characters modulo d (which is square-free), each local component must be a primitive character modulo p, which for prime p, primitive characters modulo p are just the characters modulo p (since primes are square-free and primitive characters modulo primes can't be induced from a lower modulus). Wait, no. Actually, for modulus being a prime p, all characters modulo p are primitive except the trivial character. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a modulus p, which is prime, then a character modulo p is primitive if it cannot be induced by a character modulo 1, which is trivial. But the trivial character modulo p is the only one that is induced by modulus 1. So, the number of primitive characters modulo p is equal to the number of characters modulo p minus 1 (excluding the trivial character). However, wait, the conductor of a character is the smallest modulus for which the character is induced. So, for a prime modulus p, the trivial character has conductor 1, since it's induced by the trivial character modulo 1. All other characters modulo p have conductor p. Therefore, the number of primitive characters modulo p is \u03c6(p) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, the number of characters modulo p is \u03c6(p) = p - 1. The trivial character has conductor 1, so the number of primitive characters modulo p is (p - 1) - 1 = p - 2. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no: to be precise, the number of primitive characters modulo p is equal to the number of nontrivial characters modulo p. Since the trivial character is the only non-primitive one. So, if there are \u03c6(p) = p-1 characters modulo p, then primitive ones are p-1 - 1 = p-2. Therefore, for each prime p, the number of primitive characters modulo p is p-2. But in our case, the modulus is d = 7*13*19*31, which is square-free, and the primitive characters modulo d are those that are primitive at each prime component. Therefore, the total number of primitive characters modulo d is the product over each prime p dividing d of the number of primitive characters modulo p. Which would be (7-2)*(13-2)*(19-2)*(31-2) = 5*11*17*29. But wait, that's the total number of primitive characters modulo d, regardless of their order. \n\nBut our problem is to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d (which is 53599) and order 6. So, among all primitive characters modulo d, how many have order exactly 6?\n\nSo, first, the group of characters modulo d is isomorphic to the product of the character groups modulo each prime component. Since each prime component's multiplicative group is cyclic, the character group modulo each prime is cyclic of order p-1. Therefore, the character group modulo d is the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 6, 12, 18, and 30 (since for p=7, 7-1=6; p=13, 13-1=12; p=19, 19-1=18; p=31, 31-1=30). So the group is C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30. \n\nSince we need characters of order 6, we need elements in this group whose order is exactly 6. Furthermore, since the characters must be primitive, each local component (i.e., each factor in the product) must be non-trivial. So, for each prime p dividing d, the component character modulo p must be non-trivial. Therefore, when constructing such a character, each component must be a non-trivial character of the respective cyclic group, and their product must have order exactly 6. \n\nThe strategy is to find all tuples (\u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731) where each \u03c7p is a non-trivial character modulo p (i.e., of order dividing p-1, but not trivial), and the product character (defined by \u03c7(n) = \u03c77(n) \u03c713(n) \u03c719(n) \u03c731(n)) has order exactly 6. Since the order of the product is the least common multiple of the orders of the components. Wait, no. Wait, in a product of cyclic groups, the order of an element (a, b, c, d) is the least common multiple of the orders of a, b, c, d. Therefore, for the character \u03c7 = (\u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731), the order of \u03c7 is the LCM of the orders of \u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731. So, to have order 6, we need that LCM(ord(\u03c77), ord(\u03c713), ord(\u03c719), ord(\u03c731)) =  6, and also that none of the components are trivial. \n\nGiven that each \u03c7p is a non-trivial character modulo p, which is a cyclic group of order p-1. So the possible orders of \u03c7p are the divisors of p-1 greater than 1 (since they have to be non-trivial). Let's list for each prime p:\n\np=7: p-1=6. So possible orders for \u03c77: divisors of 6 greater than 1, i.e., 2, 3, 6.\n\np=13: p-1=12. Possible orders for \u03c713: divisors of 12 greater than 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\np=19: p-1=18. Possible orders: 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.\n\np=31: p-1=30. Possible orders: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n\nOur task is to choose \u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731, each non-trivial, such that the LCM of their orders is 6. Also, since the LCM must be 6, each component's order must divide 6. Wait, because if LCM(a,b,c,d)=6, then each of a,b,c,d must divide 6. Because LCM is the smallest number divisible by each. So for example, if one component had order 9, then LCM would have to be at least 9, which contradicts the LCM being 6. Therefore, all the component orders must divide 6. Therefore, for each prime p, we need to consider the possible orders of \u03c7p that divide 6. Let's check each prime:\n\nFor p=7: orders dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6. Since p-1=6, so yes.\n\nFor p=13: orders dividing 6. 12's divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The ones dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6. So, possible orders for \u03c713: 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor p=19: orders dividing 6. p-1=18. Divisors of 18 are 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. Those dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor p=31: p-1=30. Divisors of 30: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30. Those dividing 6: 2, 3, 6.\n\nTherefore, for each prime, the possible orders of \u03c7p are 2, 3, 6. However, note that for p=7, since p-1=6, the characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6. Similarly for others.\n\nBut since the LCM of all orders must be 6, we need that at least one of the components has order 6, or some combination where LCM becomes 6. Wait, no. For example, if all components have order 2, LCM is 2. If some have order 3 and the rest 2, LCM is 6. If one component has order 6 and others have orders dividing 6, LCM could be 6. So all possible combinations where the LCM is 6. So, possible orders of components:\n\nWe need to have that the LCM of the orders is 6. Therefore, the possible orders for each component can be 2, 3, or 6, but such that the LCM is exactly 6. That is, not all components have order 2, or 3. At least one component must have order 3 and at least one component must have order 2, or have a component with order 6. Because 6 is already a multiple of 2 and 3, so if any component has order 6, then the LCM would be 6 if all others are divisors of 6. Wait, no. If one component is 6, then LCM(6, others) would be 6 if others divide 6. So, indeed, we need to count all tuples where each component's order divides 6 (i.e., 2, 3, 6), and such that the LCM of the orders is exactly 6. Therefore, we have two cases:\n\n1. All components have orders dividing 6, and the LCM is exactly 6. So this includes tuples where some components have order 2, some 3, and possibly one or more components have order 6. But the LCM of all must be 6.\n\nBut how can we count such tuples?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of such characters is equal to the number of elements of order 6 in the group C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30, but with the restriction that each component is non-trivial. Wait, but actually, the group here is C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30, but each component is the character group modulo p, which is cyclic of order p-1.\n\nWait, but we need to model the group of characters as the product of cyclic groups. However, in our case, for each prime p, the character group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, which for p=7 is 6, p=13 is 12, p=19 is 18, p=31 is 30. Therefore, the entire character group is C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30. However, we are considering the primitive characters, which in the square-free case correspond to characters where each component is non-trivial. Therefore, in the product group C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30, the primitive characters correspond to the elements where each component is non-identity. So, each component must be an element of order at least 2 in each cyclic group.\n\nBut we want the elements of this product group where each component is non-trivial (i.e., primitive character) and the element has order 6.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of elements (a, b, c, d) in C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30 such that:\n\n1. a \u2260 1 in C6,\n\n2. b \u2260 1 in C12,\n\n3. c \u2260 1 in C18,\n\n4. d \u2260 1 in C30,\n\n5. The order of (a, b, c, d) is 6.\n\nSo, how do we count such elements?\n\nFirst, note that the order of (a, b, c, d) is the LCM of the orders of a, b, c, d. Therefore, we need to find all tuples where the LCM of ord(a), ord(b), ord(c), ord(d) is 6, and each component is non-trivial.\n\nSo, each component's order must divide 6, and the LCM must be 6. Therefore, each component must have order dividing 6, and at least one component must have order 3, and at least one component must have order 2, or some component of order 6. Because LCM(orders) = 6.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- If all components have order 2, LCM is 2, which is not 6.\n\n- If all components have order 3, LCM is 3, which is not 6.\n\n- If some components have order 2 and others 3, LCM is 6.\n\n- If any component has order 6, then LCM is at least 6. However, if another component has order which is a multiple of 6, then LCM would be higher. But since all orders must divide 6, other components can only have orders 2, 3, or 6. If a component has order 6, then LCM(6, 6) = 6. So, if at least one component has order 6, and the rest have orders dividing 6, then LCM is 6.\n\nTherefore, the possible cases are:\n\nCase 1: At least one component has order 6, and the remaining components have orders dividing 6 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 6). But since all components must be non-trivial, their orders can't be 1. Therefore, in this case, other components can have orders 2, 3, or 6, but LCM including the 6 from one component, so LCM will still be 6.\n\nCase 2: No component has order 6. Then, the LCM must be 6, which requires that there's at least one component with order 2 and at least one component with order 3. \n\nTherefore, the total number is equal to the number of tuples in Case 1 plus the number of tuples in Case 2.\n\nBut let's formalize this. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nFor each prime p, the cyclic group C_{p-1} has elements of orders dividing 6 which are non-trivial. For each p, the possible orders are:\n\n- For p=7 (C6): elements can have orders 2, 3, 6.\n\n- For p=13 (C12): elements of orders dividing 6: 2, 3, 6. (Note that in C12, elements can have orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Non-trivial ones: 2,3,4,6,12. But restricting to orders dividing 6: 2,3,6.)\n\n- For p=19 (C18): similarly, orders dividing 6: 2,3,6.\n\n- For p=31 (C30): orders dividing 6: 2,3,6.\n\nTherefore, for each prime p, the number of elements of order dividing 6 and non-trivial is \u03c6(2) + \u03c6(3) + \u03c6(6) for each group. Wait, actually, in each C_{p-1}, the number of elements of order exactly k is \u03c6(k), provided that k divides p-1.\n\nBut since we need to count elements in each component with orders 2, 3, or 6, and non-trivial, the counts would be:\n\nFor p=7 (C6):\n\n- \u03c6(2) = 1\n\n- \u03c6(3) = 2\n\n- \u03c6(6) = 2\n\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Wait, but C6 has \u03c6(6)=2 elements of order 6, \u03c6(3)=2 elements of order 3, \u03c6(2)=1 element of order 2. So total of 5 elements with orders 2, 3, 6. But since the group has order 6, and the trivial element is order 1, so yes, 5 elements.\n\nSimilarly for p=13 (C12). The elements of orders 2,3,6 in C12:\n\n- \u03c6(2) = 1 (elements of order 2)\n\n- \u03c6(3) = 2 (elements of order 3)\n\n- \u03c6(6) = 2 (elements of order 6)\n\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But C12 has more elements: \u03c6(4)=2, \u03c6(12)=4. But we are only considering orders dividing 6 here. So total 5 non-trivial elements with orders 2,3,6.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in C12, the elements of order 2: there is \u03c6(2)=1. Order 3: \u03c6(3)=2. Order 4: \u03c6(4)=2. Order 6: \u03c6(6)=2. Order 12: \u03c6(12)=4. So, orders dividing 6 are 1,2,3,6. So non-trivial elements with orders 2,3,6: \u03c6(2)=1, \u03c6(3)=2, \u03c6(6)=2. Total 5. So yes, 5 elements.\n\nSimilarly for p=19 (C18). Orders dividing 6: 2,3,6. So:\n\n\u03c6(2)=1, \u03c6(3)=2, \u03c6(6)=2. Total 5.\n\nFor p=31 (C30). Orders dividing 6: 2,3,6. \u03c6(2)=1, \u03c6(3)=2, \u03c6(6)=2. Total 5.\n\nTherefore, for each component, there are 5 elements that have orders dividing 6 and non-trivial. So the total number of tuples (without considering the LCM) would be 5^4=625. But we need to subtract those tuples where LCM(orders) is less than 6. However, since we need LCM=6, it's better to compute it directly.\n\nAlternatively, use inclusion-exclusion. Compute the number of tuples where all components have orders dividing 6 (which we already have as 5^4=625) minus those where LCM is 1, 2, or 3. But since all components are non-trivial, LCM cannot be 1. So we need to subtract tuples where LCM is 2 or 3, and also subtract those where LCM is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 2 or 3). Then the number of desired tuples is total tuples with orders dividing 6 and non-trivial minus those with LCM 2 or 3.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of tuples where LCM is 2 or 3?\n\nFirst, compute number of tuples where LCM=2:\n\nFor LCM=2, all components must have orders dividing 2, and at least one component has order 2.\n\nBut since components are non-trivial, their orders are exactly 2. So each component must have order 2. But wait, if all components have order 2, then LCM=2. So the number of such tuples is the product over each component of the number of elements of order 2 in each group.\n\nFor each prime p:\n\n- p=7: \u03c6(2)=1 element of order 2.\n\n- p=13: \u03c6(2)=1.\n\n- p=19: \u03c6(2)=1.\n\n- p=31: \u03c6(2)=1.\n\nTherefore, the number of tuples where all components have order 2 is 1^4=1. So LCM=2 is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for LCM=3:\n\nAll components must have orders dividing 3, and at least one component has order 3.\n\nBut since components are non-trivial, their orders are exactly 3. So each component must have order 3. The number of such tuples is the product over each component of the number of elements of order 3.\n\nFor each prime p:\n\n- p=7: \u03c6(3)=2 elements of order 3.\n\nWait, wait. Let's check:\n\nWait, for C6 (p=7):\n\nNumber of elements of order 3 is \u03c6(3)=2. Yes.\n\nFor C12 (p=13):\n\nNumber of elements of order 3 is \u03c6(3)=2.\n\nFor C18 (p=19):\n\nNumber of elements of order 3 is \u03c6(3)=2.\n\nFor C30 (p=31):\n\nNumber of elements of order 3 is \u03c6(3)=2.\n\nBut wait, in C12, 3 divides 12, so yes, \u03c6(3)=2. Similarly in C18 and C30, \u03c6(3)=2.\n\nTherefore, the number of tuples where all components have order 3 is 2^4=16. So LCM=3 is 16.\n\nHowever, wait, if a component has order 3 and another component has order 1, but since components must be non-trivial, all components must have order 3. So LCM=3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of tuples with LCM=3 is 16.\n\nAdditionally, there might be tuples where some components have order 2 and others 3, but LCM=6. Wait, no. That's part of the desired count. So, the tuples that have LCM=6 are those where either:\n\n- At least one component has order 6, and the rest have orders dividing 6 (but at least 2), or\n\n- All components have orders 2 or 3, and there's at least one of each.\n\nTherefore, to compute the total number of tuples with LCM=6:\n\nTotal tuples with orders dividing 6 (625) minus tuples with LCM=2 (1) minus tuples with LCM=3 (16) minus tuples with LCM=1 (0, since all components are non-trivial).\n\nBut wait, LCM=1 is only possible if all components have order 1, which they don't. So:\n\nNumber of desired tuples = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608.\n\nWait, that seems high. But is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. So all tuples where components have orders dividing 6, non-trivial, total 5^4=625. Then subtract those with LCM=2 (1) and LCM=3 (16), so 625 - 1 -16=608. Hmm. But does this count correctly?\n\nWait, but in LCM=2, we have all components with order 2. In LCM=3, all components with order 3. So yes, these are the only cases where LCM is 2 or 3. The rest of the 625 -1 -16 = 608 tuples must have LCM=6. Therefore, the answer is 608.\n\nWait, but that seems plausible? Let me check with a small example. Suppose we have two components, each with possible orders 2,3,6. Total tuples: 5*5=25. Those with LCM=2: components both order 2: 1*1=1. LCM=3: both order 3: 2*2=4. LCM=6: the remaining 25 -1 -4=20. So, 20 tuples where LCM=6. Let's see: these could be mixed orders (some 2, some 3, some 6). For example, (2,3) gives LCM=6. (3,2) also. Or (6,2), LCM=6. Etc. So yes, in that case, the count would indeed be 20. So similar logic applies here. So in our problem, with four components, the same logic gives 625 -1 -16=608.\n\nBut wait, let me verify if there are other possible LCMs. For example, suppose a component has order 6 and others have orders 2. Then LCM is 6. If one component has order 6, and others have orders 3, LCM is 6. If some have order 6 and others have orders 2 or 3, then LCM is 6. So yes, all tuples where not all orders are 2 or 3, and LCM is 6. So 608.\n\nBut wait, but in this calculation, we have considered all components with orders dividing 6. But are there other orders possible? For example, in p=13 (C12), the elements can have orders up to 12, but we are restricting to elements with orders dividing 6. So, in the group C12, the elements of order dividing 6 are precisely those with orders 1,2,3,6. But since we need non-trivial elements, orders 2,3,6. So yes, we are correct to restrict to these. So the total number of tuples with components' orders dividing 6 is indeed 5^4=625.\n\nBut in reality, the multiplicative group (Z/53599Z)^* is isomorphic to C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30. So when we take characters, the dual group is isomorphic to that. But when considering elements of the dual group (i.e., characters), each character corresponds to a tuple (\u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731), where each \u03c7p is a character of the respective cyclic group. The orders of the characters are the same as the orders of the elements in the dual group. So yes, the analysis holds.\n\nTherefore, the number of primitive characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is 608. Wait, but this seems high. Let me think again. 5^4=625, subtract 1 (all order 2) and 16 (all order 3) to get 608. But confidence in this answer?\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because for the LCM to be 6, you need that the orders are such that their LCM is 6. So, each component's order must divide 6, and not all components' orders divide to a lower LCM. But maybe my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, an alternative way to compute the number of elements of order 6 in the product group where each component is non-trivial. Let's model each component:\n\nFor each component (prime p), let\u2019s denote:\n\n- For p=7 (C6): possible orders 2,3,6.\n\n- For p=13 (C12): orders 2,3,6.\n\n- For p=19 (C18): orders 2,3,6.\n\n- For p=31 (C30): orders 2,3,6.\n\nIn each component, the number of elements of order exactly k is \u03c6(k), provided that k divides the group order. For example, in C6 (p=7):\n\n- \u03c6(2)=1, \u03c6(3)=2, \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo, to compute the number of tuples (a,b,c,d) where each component has order dividing 6 and non-trivial, and LCM(a,b,c,d)=6.\n\nThis is equivalent to the inclusion-exclusion principle. That is, the number of tuples where LCM is exactly 6 is equal to the total number of tuples with orders dividing 6, minus those with LCM dividing 6 but less than 6. Which are LCM=1, 2, 3. But since all components are non-trivial, LCM=1 is impossible. So subtract those with LCM=2 and LCM=3.\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumber of desired tuples = Total tuples with orders dividing 6 (625) - tuples with LCM=2 (1) - tuples with LCM=3 (16) = 608.\n\nThus, the answer would be 608. But wait, let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of each component and how they contribute to the order.\n\nTo have LCM=6, the exponents of primes in the LCM must be max exponents across components. Since 6=2\u00d73, we need that the maximum exponent of 2 in any component's order is 1, and the maximum exponent of 3 in any component's order is 1. Therefore, each component's order must be a divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, since all components are non-trivial, their orders are at least 2. So possible orders: 2, 3, 6.\n\nNow, for the LCM to be 6, we need that at least one component has order divisible by 2 and at least one component has order divisible by 3. Moreover, no component can have an order with a prime factor other than 2 or 3. Since all components are restricted to orders dividing 6, this is already satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, breaking into cases based on whether a component has order 6:\n\nCase 1: At least one component has order 6. Then, since order 6 includes both 2 and 3, the LCM will be 6 as long as no component has order higher than 6. But since we already restricted components to orders dividing 6, this is satisfied. So the number of such tuples is equal to (number of ways to have at least one component order 6) multiplied by the number of ways to choose the other components with orders dividing 6 (but non-trivial). However, this is inclusion-exclusion again.\n\nAlternatively, the number of tuples with at least one component of order 6 is equal to total tuples with components possibly having order 6 minus tuples where no component has order 6.\n\nBut this might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, for each component, the number of elements of order 6 in each group:\n\nFor p=7 (C6): \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nFor p=13 (C12): \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nFor p=19 (C18): \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nFor p=31 (C30): \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nTherefore, each component has 2 elements of order 6.\n\nSo the number of tuples where at least one component has order 6 is equal to the inclusion-exclusion over the four components:\n\nSum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1} C(4,i) * (2^i) * (5 - 2)^{4 - i} }.\n\nWait, no, this is getting too complicated. Let's try to compute the number of tuples where at least one component has order 6. Let's instead compute the total number of tuples where at least one component is order 6. For each component, the number of elements of order 6 is 2, and for other components, they can be any of the 5 elements (orders 2,3,6) except that when considering \"at least one\", it's easier to compute total tuples with at least one order 6 as:\n\nTotal tuples with at least one order 6 = Total tuples with any order 6 components = Total tuples - tuples with no order 6 components.\n\nTotal tuples:5^4=625.\n\nTuples with no order 6 components: For each component, number of elements with order 2 or 3. For each component:\n\n- p=7: orders 2,3: 1+2=3.\n\n- p=13: orders 2,3:1+2=3.\n\n- p=19: same, 1+2=3.\n\n- p=31: same, 1+2=3.\n\nTherefore, tuples with no order 6 components: 3^4=81.\n\nTherefore, tuples with at least one order 6 component: 625 -81=544.\n\nNow, these 544 tuples have at least one component with order 6. However, the LCM of such tuples could be 6 or higher. Wait, but since we required all components to have orders dividing 6, and one component has order 6, then LCM is 6. Because all other components have orders dividing 6, so LCM can't be higher than 6. Therefore, tuples with at least one component of order 6 and all others dividing 6 will have LCM=6. So these 544 tuples are part of the desired count.\n\nThen, the remaining tuples with LCM=6 are those where no component has order 6, but the LCM is still 6. That is, they have components with orders 2 and 3 such that the LCM is 6. How many such tuples are there?\n\nThese are the tuples where no component has order 6, and the LCM of the orders is 6. Which requires that there is at least one component with order 2 and at least one component with order 3. Since if all components have order 2, LCM=2; if all components have order 3, LCM=3. So to have LCM=6, there must be at least one 2 and at least one 3.\n\nThe number of such tuples is equal to (number of tuples with orders 2 or 3) minus (number of tuples with all orders 2) minus (number of tuples with all orders 3).\n\nNumber of tuples with orders 2 or 3 (and non-trivial):\n\nFor each component, number of elements of orders 2 or 3: for each p, it's 1 (order 2) + 2 (order 3) =3. Hence, total tuples: 3^4=81.\n\nSubtract the all-2s:1^4=1 and all-3s:2^4=16. So 81 -1 -16=64.\n\nTherefore, there are 64 tuples where components have orders 2 or 3, and LCM=6.\n\nTherefore, total number of desired tuples is 544 + 64=608.\n\nSo that confirms the previous result of 608. Therefore, the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is 608.\n\nBut wait, let's check for any possible mistakes here. For example, the count of elements of order 6 in each component. For example, in C6 (p=7), \u03c6(6)=2 elements of order 6. In C12 (p=13), \u03c6(6)=2 elements of order 6. Similarly for others. So 2 elements per component. Therefore, the number of tuples with at least one order 6 component is 625 - 3^4 = 625 -81=544. Correct.\n\nThen, the remaining 64 tuples where LCM=6 come from mixing orders 2 and 3. Therefore, total 544 +64=608.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 608. But let me think if there\u2019s any other catch.\n\nWait, the question asks for primitive characters. But in our calculation, we already required that each component is non-trivial, which corresponds to being primitive. Therefore, yes, each component is non-trivial, so these 608 characters are indeed primitive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 608, and confidence is high. But wait, let me check if the total number of primitive characters is correctly given by (p1-2)(p2-2)... where pi are the prime factors. Wait, for a square-free modulus d with k prime factors, the number of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo d is \u03c6(d) multiplied by something? Wait, no. For each prime p, the number of primitive characters modulo p is p-2 (excluding the trivial character). But when d is square-free with k prime factors, the total number of primitive characters modulo d is the product over each prime p|d of (number of non-trivial characters modulo p), which is for each prime p, (p-1 -1)=p-2. Therefore, the total number of primitive characters modulo d is product_{p|d} (p-2). Wait, but for d=7*13*19*31, this would be (7-2)(13-2)(19-2)(31-2)=5*11*17*29. Let's compute that: 5*11=55, 55*17=935, 935*29=27115. So total primitive characters modulo d=53599 is 27115. But according to our previous count, the number of tuples with components non-trivial (orders dividing 6 or not) would be (7-2)(13-2)(19-2)(31-2)=5*11*17*29=27115. But in our problem, we are only considering characters of order 6, which is a subset of all primitive characters. So among 27115 primitive characters, 608 of them have order 6. That seems plausible, but a sanity check: 608 is roughly 2% of 27115, which is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, my answer is 608.\n\n**Final Answer**\nExplanation: The conductor \\( d = 53599 \\) factors into primes \\( 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31 \\).

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic concepts here. \n\nFirst, Dirichlet characters are functions that arise in number theory, particularly in the context of Dirichlet L-functions. A Dirichlet character modulo n is called primitive if it cannot be induced by any character modulo a proper divisor of n. The conductor of a character is the modulus of the associated primitive character. So, in this case, since the conductor is given as 53599, that means we're looking for primitive characters modulo 53599.\n\nThe order of a character is the smallest positive integer k such that \u03c7^k is the trivial character. So, an order 6 character means that \u03c7^6 is trivial, and there's no smaller positive integer than 6 with that property. Therefore, the character must have multiplicative order 6 in the group of Dirichlet characters modulo 53599.\n\nNow, the key steps here are to determine the structure of the multiplicative group modulo 53599, because the number of primitive characters of a given order depends on the structure of this group. The number of primitive characters of conductor d and order m is equal to \u03c6(m) multiplied by the number of primitive multiplicative characters of order m modulo d. Wait, actually, I need to be careful here. Let me think again.\n\nThe conductor d must be equal to the modulus here since the characters are primitive. So, modulus and conductor are the same. For the character to be primitive, the modulus cannot be reduced. Therefore, the modulus is 53599, which is prime? Wait, let me check if 53599 is a prime number. If not, its factorization will matter because the structure of the multiplicative group modulo d depends on whether d is prime, a prime power, or composite.\n\nWait, let's factorize 53599. Let me try dividing by small primes. First, check if it's even: 53599 is odd. Sum of digits: 5+3+5+9+9 = 31, which isn't divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3. Next, test 5: last digit is 9, so no. Then 7: 53599 \u00f77. Let's compute 7*7657 = 53599? 7*7000=49000, 7*600=4200, 7*57=399. So 7000+600+57=7657. 7*7657: 49000 + 4200=53200, plus 399=53599. Yes! So 53599 =7*7657. Wait, but 7657 needs to be checked if it's prime. Let me check 7657. Divided by 7: 7*1000=7000, 7657-7000=657. 657 \u00f77=93.857\u2026 Not integer. Next, 11: 7657. 11*696 = 7656, so 7657-7656=1. Not divisible by 11. 13: 13*589=7657? 13*500=6500, 13*80=1040, 13*9=117. 6500+1040=7540+117=7657. Yes! So 7657=13*589. Now check if 589 is prime. 589 divided by 17: 17*34=578, 589-578=11. Not divisible. 19: 19*31=589? 19*30=570, 19*1=19. 570+19=589. Yes! So 589=19*31. Therefore, the prime factorization of 53599 is 7*13*19*31. All primes here.\n\nSo, d=53599 factors into distinct primes: 7, 13, 19, 31. Since these are distinct primes, the modulus is square-free. For a square-free modulus, the multiplicative group modulo d is isomorphic to the product of the multiplicative groups modulo each prime factor. That is, (Z/dZ)^* \u2245 (Z/7Z)^* \u00d7 (Z/13Z)^* \u00d7 (Z/19Z)^* \u00d7 (Z/31Z)^*. Each of these factors is cyclic because the multiplicative group modulo a prime is cyclic. Therefore, the entire group is isomorphic to the product of cyclic groups of orders 6, 12, 18, and 30, respectively. Wait, let's check:\n\nFor primes p, (Z/pZ)^* is cyclic of order p-1. So:\n\n- For p=7: order 6\n- p=13: order 12\n- p=19: order 18\n- p=31: order 30\n\nTherefore, the group (Z/53599Z)^* is isomorphic to C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30, where Ck denotes a cyclic group of order k. \n\nNow, the group of Dirichlet characters modulo d is isomorphic to the dual group of (Z/dZ)^*, which for finite abelian groups is isomorphic to the group itself. Therefore, the group of characters is also isomorphic to C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30. \n\nBut we are looking for primitive characters of order 6. Now, a primitive character modulo d is one that cannot be induced by a character modulo a proper divisor of d. However, since d is square-free, any primitive character modulo d is equivalent to a character whose modulus is d, and the primitive characters correspond to characters that are nontrivial on each component (since d is square-free). Wait, actually, when the modulus is square-free, a character is primitive if and only if it is nontrivial on each prime component. Because if a character were trivial on one prime component, then it could be considered as a character modulo the product of the other primes, which is a proper divisor. Therefore, the primitive characters modulo square-free d are those that are nontrivial on each prime factor. \n\nTherefore, in the group of characters, which is the product of the character groups for each prime component, the primitive characters correspond to characters where each component character is non-trivial. Therefore, the number of primitive characters would be the product over each prime factor of (number of non-trivial characters for that component). Wait, but perhaps more accurately, since the group of characters modulo d is the product of the character groups modulo each prime power in the factorization. But since d is square-free, each component is modulo a prime. Thus, the primitive characters are exactly those that are nontrivial on each component. So, the total number of primitive characters would be the product over each prime p dividing d of (\u03c6(p) - 1), but wait. Wait, for each prime p, the number of characters modulo p is \u03c6(p) = p-1. However, when considering primitive characters modulo d (which is square-free), each local component must be a primitive character modulo p, which for prime p, primitive characters modulo p are just the characters modulo p (since primes are square-free and primitive characters modulo primes can't be induced from a lower modulus). Wait, no. Actually, for modulus being a prime p, all characters modulo p are primitive except the trivial character. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a modulus p, which is prime, then a character modulo p is primitive if it cannot be induced by a character modulo 1, which is trivial. But the trivial character modulo p is the only one that is induced by modulus 1. So, the number of primitive characters modulo p is equal to the number of characters modulo p minus 1 (excluding the trivial character). However, wait, the conductor of a character is the smallest modulus for which the character is induced. So, for a prime modulus p, the trivial character has conductor 1, since it's induced by the trivial character modulo 1. All other characters modulo p have conductor p. Therefore, the number of primitive characters modulo p is \u03c6(p) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, the number of characters modulo p is \u03c6(p) = p - 1. The trivial character has conductor 1, so the number of primitive characters modulo p is (p - 1) - 1 = p - 2. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no: to be precise, the number of primitive characters modulo p is equal to the number of nontrivial characters modulo p. Since the trivial character is the only non-primitive one. So, if there are \u03c6(p) = p-1 characters modulo p, then primitive ones are p-1 - 1 = p-2. Therefore, for each prime p, the number of primitive characters modulo p is p-2. But in our case, the modulus is d = 7*13*19*31, which is square-free, and the primitive characters modulo d are those that are primitive at each prime component. Therefore, the total number of primitive characters modulo d is the product over each prime p dividing d of the number of primitive characters modulo p. Which would be (7-2)*(13-2)*(19-2)*(31-2) = 5*11*17*29. But wait, that's the total number of primitive characters modulo d, regardless of their order. \n\nBut our problem is to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d (which is 53599) and order 6. So, among all primitive characters modulo d, how many have order exactly 6?\n\nSo, first, the group of characters modulo d is isomorphic to the product of the character groups modulo each prime component. Since each prime component's multiplicative group is cyclic, the character group modulo each prime is cyclic of order p-1. Therefore, the character group modulo d is the direct product of cyclic groups of orders 6, 12, 18, and 30 (since for p=7, 7-1=6; p=13, 13-1=12; p=19, 19-1=18; p=31, 31-1=30). So the group is C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30. \n\nSince we need characters of order 6, we need elements in this group whose order is exactly 6. Furthermore, since the characters must be primitive, each local component (i.e., each factor in the product) must be non-trivial. So, for each prime p dividing d, the component character modulo p must be non-trivial. Therefore, when constructing such a character, each component must be a non-trivial character of the respective cyclic group, and their product must have order exactly 6. \n\nThe strategy is to find all tuples (\u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731) where each \u03c7p is a non-trivial character modulo p (i.e., of order dividing p-1, but not trivial), and the product character (defined by \u03c7(n) = \u03c77(n) \u03c713(n) \u03c719(n) \u03c731(n)) has order exactly 6. Since the order of the product is the least common multiple of the orders of the components. Wait, no. Wait, in a product of cyclic groups, the order of an element (a, b, c, d) is the least common multiple of the orders of a, b, c, d. Therefore, for the character \u03c7 = (\u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731), the order of \u03c7 is the LCM of the orders of \u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731. So, to have order 6, we need that LCM(ord(\u03c77), ord(\u03c713), ord(\u03c719), ord(\u03c731)) =  6, and also that none of the components are trivial. \n\nGiven that each \u03c7p is a non-trivial character modulo p, which is a cyclic group of order p-1. So the possible orders of \u03c7p are the divisors of p-1 greater than 1 (since they have to be non-trivial). Let's list for each prime p:\n\np=7: p-1=6. So possible orders for \u03c77: divisors of 6 greater than 1, i.e., 2, 3, 6.\n\np=13: p-1=12. Possible orders for \u03c713: divisors of 12 greater than 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\np=19: p-1=18. Possible orders: 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.\n\np=31: p-1=30. Possible orders: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n\nOur task is to choose \u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731, each non-trivial, such that the LCM of their orders is 6. Also, since the LCM must be 6, each component's order must divide 6. Wait, because if LCM(a,b,c,d)=6, then each of a,b,c,d must divide 6. Because LCM is the smallest number divisible by each. So for example, if one component had order 9, then LCM would have to be at least 9, which contradicts the LCM being 6. Therefore, all the component orders must divide 6. Therefore, for each prime p, we need to consider the possible orders of \u03c7p that divide 6. Let's check each prime:\n\nFor p=7: orders dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6. Since p-1=6, so yes.\n\nFor p=13: orders dividing 6. 12's divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The ones dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6. So, possible orders for \u03c713: 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor p=19: orders dividing 6. p-1=18. Divisors of 18 are 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. Those dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor p=31: p-1=30. Divisors of 30: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30. Those dividing 6: 2, 3, 6.\n\nTherefore, for each prime, the possible orders of \u03c7p are 2, 3, 6. However, note that for p=7, since p-1=6, the characters can have orders 2, 3, or 6. Similarly for others.\n\nBut since the LCM of all orders must be 6, we need that at least one of the components has order 6, or some combination where LCM becomes 6. Wait, no. For example, if all components have order 2, LCM is 2. If some have order 3 and the rest 2, LCM is 6. If one component has order 6 and others have orders dividing 6, LCM could be 6. So all possible combinations where the LCM is 6. So, possible orders of components:\n\nWe need to have that the LCM of the orders is 6. Therefore, the possible orders for each component can be 2, 3, or 6, but such that the LCM is exactly 6. That is, not all components have order 2, or 3. At least one component must have order 3 and at least one component must have order 2, or have a component with order 6. Because 6 is already a multiple of 2 and 3, so if any component has order 6, then the LCM would be 6 if all others are divisors of 6. Wait, no. If one component is 6, then LCM(6, others) would be 6 if others divide 6. So, indeed, we need to count all tuples where each component's order divides 6 (i.e., 2, 3, 6), and such that the LCM of the orders is exactly 6. Therefore, we have two cases:\n\n1. All components have orders dividing 6, and the LCM is exactly 6. So this includes tuples where some components have order 2, some 3, and possibly one or more components have order 6. But the LCM of all must be 6.\n\nBut how can we count such tuples?\n\nAlternatively, the total number of such characters is equal to the number of elements of order 6 in the group C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30, but with the restriction that each component is non-trivial. Wait, but actually, the group here is C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30, but each component is the character group modulo p, which is cyclic of order p-1.\n\nWait, but we need to model the group of characters as the product of cyclic groups. However, in our case, for each prime p, the character group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1, which for p=7 is 6, p=13 is 12, p=19 is 18, p=31 is 30. Therefore, the entire character group is C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30. However, we are considering the primitive characters, which in the square-free case correspond to characters where each component is non-trivial. Therefore, in the product group C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30, the primitive characters correspond to the elements where each component is non-identity. So, each component must be an element of order at least 2 in each cyclic group.\n\nBut we want the elements of this product group where each component is non-trivial (i.e., primitive character) and the element has order 6.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of elements (a, b, c, d) in C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30 such that:\n\n1. a \u2260 1 in C6,\n\n2. b \u2260 1 in C12,\n\n3. c \u2260 1 in C18,\n\n4. d \u2260 1 in C30,\n\n5. The order of (a, b, c, d) is 6.\n\nSo, how do we count such elements?\n\nFirst, note that the order of (a, b, c, d) is the LCM of the orders of a, b, c, d. Therefore, we need to find all tuples where the LCM of ord(a), ord(b), ord(c), ord(d) is 6, and each component is non-trivial.\n\nSo, each component's order must divide 6, and the LCM must be 6. Therefore, each component must have order dividing 6, and at least one component must have order 3, and at least one component must have order 2, or some component of order 6. Because LCM(orders) = 6.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- If all components have order 2, LCM is 2, which is not 6.\n\n- If all components have order 3, LCM is 3, which is not 6.\n\n- If some components have order 2 and others 3, LCM is 6.\n\n- If any component has order 6, then LCM is at least 6. However, if another component has order which is a multiple of 6, then LCM would be higher. But since all orders must divide 6, other components can only have orders 2, 3, or 6. If a component has order 6, then LCM(6, 6) = 6. So, if at least one component has order 6, and the rest have orders dividing 6, then LCM is 6.\n\nTherefore, the possible cases are:\n\nCase 1: At least one component has order 6, and the remaining components have orders dividing 6 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 6). But since all components must be non-trivial, their orders can't be 1. Therefore, in this case, other components can have orders 2, 3, or 6, but LCM including the 6 from one component, so LCM will still be 6.\n\nCase 2: No component has order 6. Then, the LCM must be 6, which requires that there's at least one component with order 2 and at least one component with order 3. \n\nTherefore, the total number is equal to the number of tuples in Case 1 plus the number of tuples in Case 2.\n\nBut let's formalize this. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nFor each prime p, the cyclic group C_{p-1} has elements of orders dividing 6 which are non-trivial. For each p, the possible orders are:\n\n- For p=7 (C6): elements can have orders 2, 3, 6.\n\n- For p=13 (C12): elements of orders dividing 6: 2, 3, 6. (Note that in C12, elements can have orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Non-trivial ones: 2,3,4,6,12. But restricting to orders dividing 6: 2,3,6.)\n\n- For p=19 (C18): similarly, orders dividing 6: 2,3,6.\n\n- For p=31 (C30): orders dividing 6: 2,3,6.\n\nTherefore, for each prime p, the number of elements of order dividing 6 and non-trivial is \u03c6(2) + \u03c6(3) + \u03c6(6) for each group. Wait, actually, in each C_{p-1}, the number of elements of order exactly k is \u03c6(k), provided that k divides p-1.\n\nBut since we need to count elements in each component with orders 2, 3, or 6, and non-trivial, the counts would be:\n\nFor p=7 (C6):\n\n- \u03c6(2) = 1\n\n- \u03c6(3) = 2\n\n- \u03c6(6) = 2\n\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Wait, but C6 has \u03c6(6)=2 elements of order 6, \u03c6(3)=2 elements of order 3, \u03c6(2)=1 element of order 2. So total of 5 elements with orders 2, 3, 6. But since the group has order 6, and the trivial element is order 1, so yes, 5 elements.\n\nSimilarly for p=13 (C12). The elements of orders 2,3,6 in C12:\n\n- \u03c6(2) = 1 (elements of order 2)\n\n- \u03c6(3) = 2 (elements of order 3)\n\n- \u03c6(6) = 2 (elements of order 6)\n\nTotal: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But C12 has more elements: \u03c6(4)=2, \u03c6(12)=4. But we are only considering orders dividing 6 here. So total 5 non-trivial elements with orders 2,3,6.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in C12, the elements of order 2: there is \u03c6(2)=1. Order 3: \u03c6(3)=2. Order 4: \u03c6(4)=2. Order 6: \u03c6(6)=2. Order 12: \u03c6(12)=4. So, orders dividing 6 are 1,2,3,6. So non-trivial elements with orders 2,3,6: \u03c6(2)=1, \u03c6(3)=2, \u03c6(6)=2. Total 5. So yes, 5 elements.\n\nSimilarly for p=19 (C18). Orders dividing 6: 2,3,6. So:\n\n\u03c6(2)=1, \u03c6(3)=2, \u03c6(6)=2. Total 5.\n\nFor p=31 (C30). Orders dividing 6: 2,3,6. \u03c6(2)=1, \u03c6(3)=2, \u03c6(6)=2. Total 5.\n\nTherefore, for each component, there are 5 elements that have orders dividing 6 and non-trivial. So the total number of tuples (without considering the LCM) would be 5^4=625. But we need to subtract those tuples where LCM(orders) is less than 6. However, since we need LCM=6, it's better to compute it directly.\n\nAlternatively, use inclusion-exclusion. Compute the number of tuples where all components have orders dividing 6 (which we already have as 5^4=625) minus those where LCM is 1, 2, or 3. But since all components are non-trivial, LCM cannot be 1. So we need to subtract tuples where LCM is 2 or 3, and also subtract those where LCM is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 2 or 3). Then the number of desired tuples is total tuples with orders dividing 6 and non-trivial minus those with LCM 2 or 3.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of tuples where LCM is 2 or 3?\n\nFirst, compute number of tuples where LCM=2:\n\nFor LCM=2, all components must have orders dividing 2, and at least one component has order 2.\n\nBut since components are non-trivial, their orders are exactly 2. So each component must have order 2. But wait, if all components have order 2, then LCM=2. So the number of such tuples is the product over each component of the number of elements of order 2 in each group.\n\nFor each prime p:\n\n- p=7: \u03c6(2)=1 element of order 2.\n\n- p=13: \u03c6(2)=1.\n\n- p=19: \u03c6(2)=1.\n\n- p=31: \u03c6(2)=1.\n\nTherefore, the number of tuples where all components have order 2 is 1^4=1. So LCM=2 is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for LCM=3:\n\nAll components must have orders dividing 3, and at least one component has order 3.\n\nBut since components are non-trivial, their orders are exactly 3. So each component must have order 3. The number of such tuples is the product over each component of the number of elements of order 3.\n\nFor each prime p:\n\n- p=7: \u03c6(3)=2 elements of order 3.\n\nWait, wait. Let's check:\n\nWait, for C6 (p=7):\n\nNumber of elements of order 3 is \u03c6(3)=2. Yes.\n\nFor C12 (p=13):\n\nNumber of elements of order 3 is \u03c6(3)=2.\n\nFor C18 (p=19):\n\nNumber of elements of order 3 is \u03c6(3)=2.\n\nFor C30 (p=31):\n\nNumber of elements of order 3 is \u03c6(3)=2.\n\nBut wait, in C12, 3 divides 12, so yes, \u03c6(3)=2. Similarly in C18 and C30, \u03c6(3)=2.\n\nTherefore, the number of tuples where all components have order 3 is 2^4=16. So LCM=3 is 16.\n\nHowever, wait, if a component has order 3 and another component has order 1, but since components must be non-trivial, all components must have order 3. So LCM=3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of tuples with LCM=3 is 16.\n\nAdditionally, there might be tuples where some components have order 2 and others 3, but LCM=6. Wait, no. That's part of the desired count. So, the tuples that have LCM=6 are those where either:\n\n- At least one component has order 6, and the rest have orders dividing 6 (but at least 2), or\n\n- All components have orders 2 or 3, and there's at least one of each.\n\nTherefore, to compute the total number of tuples with LCM=6:\n\nTotal tuples with orders dividing 6 (625) minus tuples with LCM=2 (1) minus tuples with LCM=3 (16) minus tuples with LCM=1 (0, since all components are non-trivial).\n\nBut wait, LCM=1 is only possible if all components have order 1, which they don't. So:\n\nNumber of desired tuples = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608.\n\nWait, that seems high. But is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. So all tuples where components have orders dividing 6, non-trivial, total 5^4=625. Then subtract those with LCM=2 (1) and LCM=3 (16), so 625 - 1 -16=608. Hmm. But does this count correctly?\n\nWait, but in LCM=2, we have all components with order 2. In LCM=3, all components with order 3. So yes, these are the only cases where LCM is 2 or 3. The rest of the 625 -1 -16 = 608 tuples must have LCM=6. Therefore, the answer is 608.\n\nWait, but that seems plausible? Let me check with a small example. Suppose we have two components, each with possible orders 2,3,6. Total tuples: 5*5=25. Those with LCM=2: components both order 2: 1*1=1. LCM=3: both order 3: 2*2=4. LCM=6: the remaining 25 -1 -4=20. So, 20 tuples where LCM=6. Let's see: these could be mixed orders (some 2, some 3, some 6). For example, (2,3) gives LCM=6. (3,2) also. Or (6,2), LCM=6. Etc. So yes, in that case, the count would indeed be 20. So similar logic applies here. So in our problem, with four components, the same logic gives 625 -1 -16=608.\n\nBut wait, let me verify if there are other possible LCMs. For example, suppose a component has order 6 and others have orders 2. Then LCM is 6. If one component has order 6, and others have orders 3, LCM is 6. If some have order 6 and others have orders 2 or 3, then LCM is 6. So yes, all tuples where not all orders are 2 or 3, and LCM is 6. So 608.\n\nBut wait, but in this calculation, we have considered all components with orders dividing 6. But are there other orders possible? For example, in p=13 (C12), the elements can have orders up to 12, but we are restricting to elements with orders dividing 6. So, in the group C12, the elements of order dividing 6 are precisely those with orders 1,2,3,6. But since we need non-trivial elements, orders 2,3,6. So yes, we are correct to restrict to these. So the total number of tuples with components' orders dividing 6 is indeed 5^4=625.\n\nBut in reality, the multiplicative group (Z/53599Z)^* is isomorphic to C6 \u00d7 C12 \u00d7 C18 \u00d7 C30. So when we take characters, the dual group is isomorphic to that. But when considering elements of the dual group (i.e., characters), each character corresponds to a tuple (\u03c77, \u03c713, \u03c719, \u03c731), where each \u03c7p is a character of the respective cyclic group. The orders of the characters are the same as the orders of the elements in the dual group. So yes, the analysis holds.\n\nTherefore, the number of primitive characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is 608. Wait, but this seems high. Let me think again. 5^4=625, subtract 1 (all order 2) and 16 (all order 3) to get 608. But confidence in this answer?\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because for the LCM to be 6, you need that the orders are such that their LCM is 6. So, each component's order must divide 6, and not all components' orders divide to a lower LCM. But maybe my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, an alternative way to compute the number of elements of order 6 in the product group where each component is non-trivial. Let's model each component:\n\nFor each component (prime p), let\u2019s denote:\n\n- For p=7 (C6): possible orders 2,3,6.\n\n- For p=13 (C12): orders 2,3,6.\n\n- For p=19 (C18): orders 2,3,6.\n\n- For p=31 (C30): orders 2,3,6.\n\nIn each component, the number of elements of order exactly k is \u03c6(k), provided that k divides the group order. For example, in C6 (p=7):\n\n- \u03c6(2)=1, \u03c6(3)=2, \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo, to compute the number of tuples (a,b,c,d) where each component has order dividing 6 and non-trivial, and LCM(a,b,c,d)=6.\n\nThis is equivalent to the inclusion-exclusion principle. That is, the number of tuples where LCM is exactly 6 is equal to the total number of tuples with orders dividing 6, minus those with LCM dividing 6 but less than 6. Which are LCM=1, 2, 3. But since all components are non-trivial, LCM=1 is impossible. So subtract those with LCM=2 and LCM=3.\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumber of desired tuples = Total tuples with orders dividing 6 (625) - tuples with LCM=2 (1) - tuples with LCM=3 (16) = 608.\n\nThus, the answer would be 608. But wait, let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of each component and how they contribute to the order.\n\nTo have LCM=6, the exponents of primes in the LCM must be max exponents across components. Since 6=2\u00d73, we need that the maximum exponent of 2 in any component's order is 1, and the maximum exponent of 3 in any component's order is 1. Therefore, each component's order must be a divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, since all components are non-trivial, their orders are at least 2. So possible orders: 2, 3, 6.\n\nNow, for the LCM to be 6, we need that at least one component has order divisible by 2 and at least one component has order divisible by 3. Moreover, no component can have an order with a prime factor other than 2 or 3. Since all components are restricted to orders dividing 6, this is already satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, breaking into cases based on whether a component has order 6:\n\nCase 1: At least one component has order 6. Then, since order 6 includes both 2 and 3, the LCM will be 6 as long as no component has order higher than 6. But since we already restricted components to orders dividing 6, this is satisfied. So the number of such tuples is equal to (number of ways to have at least one component order 6) multiplied by the number of ways to choose the other components with orders dividing 6 (but non-trivial). However, this is inclusion-exclusion again.\n\nAlternatively, the number of tuples with at least one component of order 6 is equal to total tuples with components possibly having order 6 minus tuples where no component has order 6.\n\nBut this might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, for each component, the number of elements of order 6 in each group:\n\nFor p=7 (C6): \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nFor p=13 (C12): \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nFor p=19 (C18): \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nFor p=31 (C30): \u03c6(6)=2.\n\nTherefore, each component has 2 elements of order 6.\n\nSo the number of tuples where at least one component has order 6 is equal to the inclusion-exclusion over the four components:\n\nSum_{i=1}^4 (-1)^{i+1} C(4,i) * (2^i) * (5 - 2)^{4 - i} }.\n\nWait, no, this is getting too complicated. Let's try to compute the number of tuples where at least one component has order 6. Let's instead compute the total number of tuples where at least one component is order 6. For each component, the number of elements of order 6 is 2, and for other components, they can be any of the 5 elements (orders 2,3,6) except that when considering \"at least one\", it's easier to compute total tuples with at least one order 6 as:\n\nTotal tuples with at least one order 6 = Total tuples with any order 6 components = Total tuples - tuples with no order 6 components.\n\nTotal tuples:5^4=625.\n\nTuples with no order 6 components: For each component, number of elements with order 2 or 3. For each component:\n\n- p=7: orders 2,3: 1+2=3.\n\n- p=13: orders 2,3:1+2=3.\n\n- p=19: same, 1+2=3.\n\n- p=31: same, 1+2=3.\n\nTherefore, tuples with no order 6 components: 3^4=81.\n\nTherefore, tuples with at least one order 6 component: 625 -81=544.\n\nNow, these 544 tuples have at least one component with order 6. However, the LCM of such tuples could be 6 or higher. Wait, but since we required all components to have orders dividing 6, and one component has order 6, then LCM is 6. Because all other components have orders dividing 6, so LCM can't be higher than 6. Therefore, tuples with at least one component of order 6 and all others dividing 6 will have LCM=6. So these 544 tuples are part of the desired count.\n\nThen, the remaining tuples with LCM=6 are those where no component has order 6, but the LCM is still 6. That is, they have components with orders 2 and 3 such that the LCM is 6. How many such tuples are there?\n\nThese are the tuples where no component has order 6, and the LCM of the orders is 6. Which requires that there is at least one component with order 2 and at least one component with order 3. Since if all components have order 2, LCM=2; if all components have order 3, LCM=3. So to have LCM=6, there must be at least one 2 and at least one 3.\n\nThe number of such tuples is equal to (number of tuples with orders 2 or 3) minus (number of tuples with all orders 2) minus (number of tuples with all orders 3).\n\nNumber of tuples with orders 2 or 3 (and non-trivial):\n\nFor each component, number of elements of orders 2 or 3: for each p, it's 1 (order 2) + 2 (order 3) =3. Hence, total tuples: 3^4=81.\n\nSubtract the all-2s:1^4=1 and all-3s:2^4=16. So 81 -1 -16=64.\n\nTherefore, there are 64 tuples where components have orders 2 or 3, and LCM=6.\n\nTherefore, total number of desired tuples is 544 + 64=608.\n\nSo that confirms the previous result of 608. Therefore, the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is 608.\n\nBut wait, let's check for any possible mistakes here. For example, the count of elements of order 6 in each component. For example, in C6 (p=7), \u03c6(6)=2 elements of order 6. In C12 (p=13), \u03c6(6)=2 elements of order 6. Similarly for others. So 2 elements per component. Therefore, the number of tuples with at least one order 6 component is 625 - 3^4 = 625 -81=544. Correct.\n\nThen, the remaining 64 tuples where LCM=6 come from mixing orders 2 and 3. Therefore, total 544 +64=608.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 608. But let me think if there\u2019s any other catch.\n\nWait, the question asks for primitive characters. But in our calculation, we already required that each component is non-trivial, which corresponds to being primitive. Therefore, yes, each component is non-trivial, so these 608 characters are indeed primitive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 608, and confidence is high. But wait, let me check if the total number of primitive characters is correctly given by (p1-2)(p2-2)... where pi are the prime factors. Wait, for a square-free modulus d with k prime factors, the number of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo d is \u03c6(d) multiplied by something? Wait, no. For each prime p, the number of primitive characters modulo p is p-2 (excluding the trivial character). But when d is square-free with k prime factors, the total number of primitive characters modulo d is the product over each prime p|d of (number of non-trivial characters modulo p), which is for each prime p, (p-1 -1)=p-2. Therefore, the total number of primitive characters modulo d is product_{p|d} (p-2). Wait, but for d=7*13*19*31, this would be (7-2)(13-2)(19-2)(31-2)=5*11*17*29. Let's compute that: 5*11=55, 55*17=935, 935*29=27115. So total primitive characters modulo d=53599 is 27115. But according to our previous count, the number of tuples with components non-trivial (orders dividing 6 or not) would be (7-2)(13-2)(19-2)(31-2)=5*11*17*29=27115. But in our problem, we are only considering characters of order 6, which is a subset of all primitive characters. So among 27115 primitive characters, 608 of them have order 6. That seems plausible, but a sanity check: 608 is roughly 2% of 27115, which is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, my answer is 608.\n\n**Final Answer**\nExplanation: The conductor \\( d = 53599 \\) factors into primes \\( 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31 \\). Primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor \\( d \\) correspond to tuples of non-trivial characters modulo each prime factor. Characters of order 6 must have component orders dividing 6 and LCM 6. Calculations show there are 608 such characters.  \nAnswer: 608  \nConfidence: 95%",
