  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find an analytical approximation for the integral I(\u03b5) when \u03b5 is small. The integral is from 0 to 15 of 1 over (\u03b5 + 9x\u2075 +5x\u2076 +9x\u2078) dx. Hmm. Alright, small \u03b5 usually suggests that maybe the integral is dominated by regions where the denominator is small, since when \u03b5 approaches zero, the integrand could become large there. So, first, I should think about where the denominator is minimized in the interval [0,15].\n\nLet me look at the denominator: \u03b5 + 9x\u2075 +5x\u2076 +9x\u2078. When \u03b5 is very small, the dominant term is the polynomial 9x\u2075 +5x\u2076 +9x\u2078. So to find where the denominator is smallest, I need to find the minimum of this polynomial on the interval [0,15]. The minimum would be where the polynomial is smallest, which would make the integrand largest. So maybe the integral is dominated by the region near that minimum.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimum of 9x\u2075 +5x\u2076 +9x\u2078. Let's see. For x in [0,15], the exponents are all positive, so as x increases, each term increases. Wait, but maybe there's a minimum somewhere. Let's check for x near zero. At x=0, the polynomial is 0 +0 +0 =0. But when x is very small but positive, like x approaching zero, then the terms 9x\u2075, 5x\u2076, 9x\u2078. The dominant term is 9x\u2075, since lower exponent. So near x=0, the polynomial is approximately 9x\u2075, which increases as x increases. So as x increases from 0, the polynomial increases. Wait, but x=0 is 0. So when x=0, the denominator is \u03b5. So as \u03b5 approaches zero, the integrand near x=0 is 1/\u03b5, which is very large. But wait, if x is approaching zero, and \u03b5 is approaching zero, but x is in the interval from 0 to 15. So maybe the integral is dominated near x=0 when \u03b5 is small?\n\nWait, but the integral is from 0 to 15. If the denominator at x=0 is \u03b5, so near x=0, the integrand is 1/(\u03b5 + ...). But if other terms are negligible compared to \u03b5 when x is near zero, then maybe the dominant contribution comes from x near zero. But as \u03b5 becomes very small, the region where the denominator is of order \u03b5 would be where the polynomial terms are comparable to \u03b5. So when x is such that 9x^5 ~ \u03b5. Let me think.\n\nSuppose \u03b5 is very small. For x near zero, 9x^5 +5x^6 +9x^8 \u22489x^5. So the denominator becomes \u03b5 +9x^5. The integrand is 1/(\u03b5 +9x^5). The main contribution to the integral would come from x where 9x^5 is comparable to \u03b5, i.e., x ~ (\u03b5/9)^(1/5). For x much larger than that, 9x^5 dominates over \u03b5, so the integrand becomes 1/(9x^5) which is small. So the integral is dominated around x ~ (\u03b5/9)^{1/5}, and the region near x=0 contributes the most.\n\nTherefore, maybe we can approximate the integral by extending the upper limit to infinity (since beyond some point, the contribution is negligible when \u03b5 is small). Then, change variables to y = x/(\u03b5/9)^{1/5} or something like that.\n\nLet me try to make a substitution. Let\u2019s set t = x / (\u03b5/a)^(1/n), where a is the coefficient of x^n. Wait, here the dominant term near x=0 is 9x^5, so maybe n=5 and a=9. Let's define a variable substitution to zoom into the region where x is of order (\u03b5/9)^{1/5}. Let\u2019s let t = x / (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} = x * (9/\u03b5)^{1/5}. Then x = t*(\u03b5/9)^{1/5}. Then dx = (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt. Substitute into the integral:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} [ (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt ] / [ \u03b5 +9*(t*(\u03b5/9)^{1/5})^5 + ... ]\n\nBut the other terms (5x^6 and 9x^8) are higher order in x, so when x is small, they can be neglected compared to 9x^5. Therefore, near x=0, the denominator is approximately \u03b5 +9x^5. Then, substituting x as above:\n\nDenominator: \u03b5 +9 [ t^5 (\u03b5/9) ] = \u03b5 + \u03b5 t^5 = \u03b5(1 + t^5)\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes approximately:\n\n\u222b_{0}^{\u221e} ( (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt ) / ( \u03b5 (1 + t^5) ) ) = (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} / \u03b5 * \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 )\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(\u03b5^{1/5} / 9^{1/5}) / \u03b5 ) = \u03b5^{-4/5} / 9^{1/5}\n\nSo the integral I(\u03b5) \u2248 (9^{-1/5}) \u03b5^{-4/5} * \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 )\n\nThe remaining integral is a constant. Let's compute \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 ). The integral of 1/(1 + t^n) from 0 to \u221e is (\u03c0/n) csc(\u03c0/n). For n=5, this would be (\u03c0/5) csc(\u03c0/5). Let me recall that csc(\u03c0/5) is 1/sin(\u03c0/5). Sin(\u03c0/5) is sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/8 ), which is approximately 0.5878. But perhaps we can write it in terms of gamma functions?\n\nAlternatively, the standard result is \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dx/(1 + x^n ) = \u03c0/(n sin(\u03c0/n)). Let me check that. For example, for n=2, the integral is \u03c0/2, which matches. For n=3, it's 2\u03c0/(3\u221a3), which also matches. So for n=5, the integral is \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)).\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 9^{-1/5} \u03b5^{-4/5} * \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5))\n\nSimplify the constants. Let me compute 9^{-1/5}. Since 9=3\u00b2, 9^{1/5}=3^{2/5}, so 9^{-1/5}= 3^{-2/5}.\n\nThus, the analytical approximation is:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 ( \u03c0 / (5 sin(\u03c0/5)) ) * 3^{-2/5} * \u03b5^{-4/5}\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the substitution again.\n\nOriginal substitution: x = t*(\u03b5/9)^{1/5}. Then dx = (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt. The denominator is \u03b5 +9x^5 \u2248 \u03b5 +9*(t^5*(\u03b5/9)) )= \u03b5 + \u03b5 t^5 = \u03b5(1 + t^5). Therefore, the integrand becomes [dx]/(denominator) = (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt / [\u03b5 (1 + t^5)] ) = (\u03b5^{-4/5}/9^{1/5}) * dt/(1 + t^5). Then, the integral from x=0 to x=15. However, when \u03b5 is small, the region where x is not near zero contributes negligibly because once x is large enough that 9x^5 >> \u03b5, the integrand is ~1/(9x^5), and integrating that from, say, (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} to 15 will be a term of order \u222b x^{-5} dx ~ x^{-4}/4, which evaluated at x=(\u03b5/9)^{1/5} gives something like ( (\u03b5/9)^{-4/5} )^{-4} = (\u03b5/9)^{ -16/5 }? Wait, perhaps I confused, but in any case, the contribution from the upper limit (15) is negligible compared to the integral near zero when \u03b5 is small, so extending the upper limit to infinity is a valid approximation in the leading order.\n\nTherefore, the leading order term in I(\u03b5) for small \u03b5 is proportional to \u03b5^{-4/5}, with the coefficient involving the integral over t and the substitution constants.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 [ (9^{-1/5}) * \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)) ] * \u03b5^{-4/5}\n\nAlternatively, simplifying 9^{-1/5} as 3^{-2/5}, but perhaps it's better to leave it as 9^{-1/5} for clarity.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the other terms in the denominator (5x^6 +9x^8) affect the approximation. Since near x ~ (\u03b5/9)^{1/5}, the term 9x^5 is of order \u03b5, and 5x^6 would be 5x * x^5 ~5x*(\u03b5/9) ~5*(\u03b5/9)^{1/5}*(\u03b5/9) =5*(\u03b5^{6/5}/9^{6/5}), which for small \u03b5 is much smaller than \u03b5, so the 5x^6 term is negligible compared to \u03b5. Similarly, the 9x^8 term would be even smaller. Therefore, in the leading order approximation for small \u03b5, these higher-order terms can be neglected, and the denominator can be approximated as \u03b5 +9x^5. So the initial approximation is valid.\n\nTherefore, the analytical formula for small \u03b5 is proportional to \u03b5^{-4/5}, and the coefficient involves the integral over t and the constants from substitution. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 C * \u03b5^{-4/5}, where C is the constant computed as 9^{-1/5} * \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)).\n\nAlternatively, sin(\u03c0/5) can be expressed as sqrt[(5 - sqrt(5))/8], but maybe leaving it as sin(\u03c0/5) is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final expression is:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\cdot 9^{-1/5} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nSimplifying 9^{-1/5} as 3^{-2/5}:\n\nAlternatively, 9^{1/5} = (3^2)^{1/5} = 3^{2/5}, so 9^{-1/5} = 3^{-2/5}\n\nSo,\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\cdot 3^{-2/5} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nAlternatively, combining the constants numerically. Let's compute the coefficient:\n\nFirst, compute sin(\u03c0/5):\n\n\u03c0/5 \u2248 0.628 radians. sin(\u03c0/5) \u2248 0.5878.\n\nSo, 1/(5*0.5878) \u2248 1/(2.939) \u2248 0.340.\n\n3^{-2/5} = e^{( -2/5 * ln 3 )} \u2248 e^{-2/5 *1.0986} \u2248 e^{-0.4394} \u2248 0.643.\n\nSo, 0.340 * 0.643 \u2248 0.2186, and then multiplied by \u03c0 \u22483.1416 gives approximately 0.2186*3.1416\u22480.686. So the coefficient is approximately 0.686. But maybe keeping it in symbolic form is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a more precise expression. Let me check if there's a known exact value for the integral \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 ). The integral is equal to \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)) as we mentioned. So the coefficient is (\u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5))) * 9^{-1/5}.\n\nAlternatively, since 9=3^2, 9^{-1/5} = 3^{-2/5}. Therefore, combining the terms:\n\nI(\u03b5) = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\cdot 3^{-2/5} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nThis is the analytical approximation for small \u03b5.\n\nBut wait, let me re-express the answer:\n\nThe integral after substitution becomes:\n\n(\u03b5/9)^{1/5} / \u03b5 * \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 )\n\nWhich is:\n\n\u03b5^{-4/5} * 9^{-1/5} * \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 )\n\nSo \u222b dt/(1 + t^5 ) = \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5))\n\nThus, putting it all together:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 (9^{-1/5} * \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5))) ) * \u03b5^{-4/5}\n\nSo the analytical formula is:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5) \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nAlternatively, 9^{1/5} = (3^2)^{1/5}=3^{2/5}, so:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5) \\cdot 3^{2/5}} } \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nThis seems correct. Therefore, this would be the analytical approximation for small \u03b5.\n\nLet me check if I considered all possible contributions. For example, near x=0, the higher-order terms in the denominator are negligible, so the approximation holds. The upper limit extension to infinity is justified because for x much larger than (\u03b5/9)^{1/5}, the integrand decays as x^{-5}, so the tail beyond 15 is negligible compared to the integral from 0 to infinity. So this should be a valid leading-order approximation for \u03b5 approaching zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is this expression. The problem says to develop an analytical formula that approximates I(\u03b5) for small \u03b5. So the leading term is this expression with \u03b5^{-4/5} dependence. Thus, that should be the answer.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To approximate $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$, the integrand is dominated near $x=0$ where the denominator $\\epsilon + 9x^5 + \\dots$ is minimized.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find an analytical approximation for the integral I(\u03b5) when \u03b5 is small. The integral is from 0 to 15 of 1 over (\u03b5 + 9x\u2075 +5x\u2076 +9x\u2078) dx. Hmm. Alright, small \u03b5 usually suggests that maybe the integral is dominated by regions where the denominator is small, since when \u03b5 approaches zero, the integrand could become large there. So, first, I should think about where the denominator is minimized in the interval [0,15].\n\nLet me look at the denominator: \u03b5 + 9x\u2075 +5x\u2076 +9x\u2078. When \u03b5 is very small, the dominant term is the polynomial 9x\u2075 +5x\u2076 +9x\u2078. So to find where the denominator is smallest, I need to find the minimum of this polynomial on the interval [0,15]. The minimum would be where the polynomial is smallest, which would make the integrand largest. So maybe the integral is dominated by the region near that minimum.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimum of 9x\u2075 +5x\u2076 +9x\u2078. Let's see. For x in [0,15], the exponents are all positive, so as x increases, each term increases. Wait, but maybe there's a minimum somewhere. Let's check for x near zero. At x=0, the polynomial is 0 +0 +0 =0. But when x is very small but positive, like x approaching zero, then the terms 9x\u2075, 5x\u2076, 9x\u2078. The dominant term is 9x\u2075, since lower exponent. So near x=0, the polynomial is approximately 9x\u2075, which increases as x increases. So as x increases from 0, the polynomial increases. Wait, but x=0 is 0. So when x=0, the denominator is \u03b5. So as \u03b5 approaches zero, the integrand near x=0 is 1/\u03b5, which is very large. But wait, if x is approaching zero, and \u03b5 is approaching zero, but x is in the interval from 0 to 15. So maybe the integral is dominated near x=0 when \u03b5 is small?\n\nWait, but the integral is from 0 to 15. If the denominator at x=0 is \u03b5, so near x=0, the integrand is 1/(\u03b5 + ...). But if other terms are negligible compared to \u03b5 when x is near zero, then maybe the dominant contribution comes from x near zero. But as \u03b5 becomes very small, the region where the denominator is of order \u03b5 would be where the polynomial terms are comparable to \u03b5. So when x is such that 9x^5 ~ \u03b5. Let me think.\n\nSuppose \u03b5 is very small. For x near zero, 9x^5 +5x^6 +9x^8 \u22489x^5. So the denominator becomes \u03b5 +9x^5. The integrand is 1/(\u03b5 +9x^5). The main contribution to the integral would come from x where 9x^5 is comparable to \u03b5, i.e., x ~ (\u03b5/9)^(1/5). For x much larger than that, 9x^5 dominates over \u03b5, so the integrand becomes 1/(9x^5) which is small. So the integral is dominated around x ~ (\u03b5/9)^{1/5}, and the region near x=0 contributes the most.\n\nTherefore, maybe we can approximate the integral by extending the upper limit to infinity (since beyond some point, the contribution is negligible when \u03b5 is small). Then, change variables to y = x/(\u03b5/9)^{1/5} or something like that.\n\nLet me try to make a substitution. Let\u2019s set t = x / (\u03b5/a)^(1/n), where a is the coefficient of x^n. Wait, here the dominant term near x=0 is 9x^5, so maybe n=5 and a=9. Let's define a variable substitution to zoom into the region where x is of order (\u03b5/9)^{1/5}. Let\u2019s let t = x / (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} = x * (9/\u03b5)^{1/5}. Then x = t*(\u03b5/9)^{1/5}. Then dx = (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt. Substitute into the integral:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} [ (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt ] / [ \u03b5 +9*(t*(\u03b5/9)^{1/5})^5 + ... ]\n\nBut the other terms (5x^6 and 9x^8) are higher order in x, so when x is small, they can be neglected compared to 9x^5. Therefore, near x=0, the denominator is approximately \u03b5 +9x^5. Then, substituting x as above:\n\nDenominator: \u03b5 +9 [ t^5 (\u03b5/9) ] = \u03b5 + \u03b5 t^5 = \u03b5(1 + t^5)\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes approximately:\n\n\u222b_{0}^{\u221e} ( (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt ) / ( \u03b5 (1 + t^5) ) ) = (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} / \u03b5 * \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 )\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(\u03b5^{1/5} / 9^{1/5}) / \u03b5 ) = \u03b5^{-4/5} / 9^{1/5}\n\nSo the integral I(\u03b5) \u2248 (9^{-1/5}) \u03b5^{-4/5} * \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 )\n\nThe remaining integral is a constant. Let's compute \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 ). The integral of 1/(1 + t^n) from 0 to \u221e is (\u03c0/n) csc(\u03c0/n). For n=5, this would be (\u03c0/5) csc(\u03c0/5). Let me recall that csc(\u03c0/5) is 1/sin(\u03c0/5). Sin(\u03c0/5) is sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/8 ), which is approximately 0.5878. But perhaps we can write it in terms of gamma functions?\n\nAlternatively, the standard result is \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dx/(1 + x^n ) = \u03c0/(n sin(\u03c0/n)). Let me check that. For example, for n=2, the integral is \u03c0/2, which matches. For n=3, it's 2\u03c0/(3\u221a3), which also matches. So for n=5, the integral is \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)).\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 9^{-1/5} \u03b5^{-4/5} * \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5))\n\nSimplify the constants. Let me compute 9^{-1/5}. Since 9=3\u00b2, 9^{1/5}=3^{2/5}, so 9^{-1/5}= 3^{-2/5}.\n\nThus, the analytical approximation is:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 ( \u03c0 / (5 sin(\u03c0/5)) ) * 3^{-2/5} * \u03b5^{-4/5}\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the substitution again.\n\nOriginal substitution: x = t*(\u03b5/9)^{1/5}. Then dx = (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt. The denominator is \u03b5 +9x^5 \u2248 \u03b5 +9*(t^5*(\u03b5/9)) )= \u03b5 + \u03b5 t^5 = \u03b5(1 + t^5). Therefore, the integrand becomes [dx]/(denominator) = (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} dt / [\u03b5 (1 + t^5)] ) = (\u03b5^{-4/5}/9^{1/5}) * dt/(1 + t^5). Then, the integral from x=0 to x=15. However, when \u03b5 is small, the region where x is not near zero contributes negligibly because once x is large enough that 9x^5 >> \u03b5, the integrand is ~1/(9x^5), and integrating that from, say, (\u03b5/9)^{1/5} to 15 will be a term of order \u222b x^{-5} dx ~ x^{-4}/4, which evaluated at x=(\u03b5/9)^{1/5} gives something like ( (\u03b5/9)^{-4/5} )^{-4} = (\u03b5/9)^{ -16/5 }? Wait, perhaps I confused, but in any case, the contribution from the upper limit (15) is negligible compared to the integral near zero when \u03b5 is small, so extending the upper limit to infinity is a valid approximation in the leading order.\n\nTherefore, the leading order term in I(\u03b5) for small \u03b5 is proportional to \u03b5^{-4/5}, with the coefficient involving the integral over t and the substitution constants.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 [ (9^{-1/5}) * \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)) ] * \u03b5^{-4/5}\n\nAlternatively, simplifying 9^{-1/5} as 3^{-2/5}, but perhaps it's better to leave it as 9^{-1/5} for clarity.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the other terms in the denominator (5x^6 +9x^8) affect the approximation. Since near x ~ (\u03b5/9)^{1/5}, the term 9x^5 is of order \u03b5, and 5x^6 would be 5x * x^5 ~5x*(\u03b5/9) ~5*(\u03b5/9)^{1/5}*(\u03b5/9) =5*(\u03b5^{6/5}/9^{6/5}), which for small \u03b5 is much smaller than \u03b5, so the 5x^6 term is negligible compared to \u03b5. Similarly, the 9x^8 term would be even smaller. Therefore, in the leading order approximation for small \u03b5, these higher-order terms can be neglected, and the denominator can be approximated as \u03b5 +9x^5. So the initial approximation is valid.\n\nTherefore, the analytical formula for small \u03b5 is proportional to \u03b5^{-4/5}, and the coefficient involves the integral over t and the constants from substitution. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 C * \u03b5^{-4/5}, where C is the constant computed as 9^{-1/5} * \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)).\n\nAlternatively, sin(\u03c0/5) can be expressed as sqrt[(5 - sqrt(5))/8], but maybe leaving it as sin(\u03c0/5) is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the final expression is:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\cdot 9^{-1/5} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nSimplifying 9^{-1/5} as 3^{-2/5}:\n\nAlternatively, 9^{1/5} = (3^2)^{1/5} = 3^{2/5}, so 9^{-1/5} = 3^{-2/5}\n\nSo,\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\cdot 3^{-2/5} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nAlternatively, combining the constants numerically. Let's compute the coefficient:\n\nFirst, compute sin(\u03c0/5):\n\n\u03c0/5 \u2248 0.628 radians. sin(\u03c0/5) \u2248 0.5878.\n\nSo, 1/(5*0.5878) \u2248 1/(2.939) \u2248 0.340.\n\n3^{-2/5} = e^{( -2/5 * ln 3 )} \u2248 e^{-2/5 *1.0986} \u2248 e^{-0.4394} \u2248 0.643.\n\nSo, 0.340 * 0.643 \u2248 0.2186, and then multiplied by \u03c0 \u22483.1416 gives approximately 0.2186*3.1416\u22480.686. So the coefficient is approximately 0.686. But maybe keeping it in symbolic form is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a more precise expression. Let me check if there's a known exact value for the integral \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 ). The integral is equal to \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)) as we mentioned. So the coefficient is (\u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5))) * 9^{-1/5}.\n\nAlternatively, since 9=3^2, 9^{-1/5} = 3^{-2/5}. Therefore, combining the terms:\n\nI(\u03b5) = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\cdot 3^{-2/5} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nThis is the analytical approximation for small \u03b5.\n\nBut wait, let me re-express the answer:\n\nThe integral after substitution becomes:\n\n(\u03b5/9)^{1/5} / \u03b5 * \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 )\n\nWhich is:\n\n\u03b5^{-4/5} * 9^{-1/5} * \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} dt/(1 + t^5 )\n\nSo \u222b dt/(1 + t^5 ) = \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5))\n\nThus, putting it all together:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 (9^{-1/5} * \u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5))) ) * \u03b5^{-4/5}\n\nSo the analytical formula is:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5) \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nAlternatively, 9^{1/5} = (3^2)^{1/5}=3^{2/5}, so:\n\nI(\u03b5) \u2248 \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5) \\cdot 3^{2/5}} } \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5}\n\nThis seems correct. Therefore, this would be the analytical approximation for small \u03b5.\n\nLet me check if I considered all possible contributions. For example, near x=0, the higher-order terms in the denominator are negligible, so the approximation holds. The upper limit extension to infinity is justified because for x much larger than (\u03b5/9)^{1/5}, the integrand decays as x^{-5}, so the tail beyond 15 is negligible compared to the integral from 0 to infinity. So this should be a valid leading-order approximation for \u03b5 approaching zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is this expression. The problem says to develop an analytical formula that approximates I(\u03b5) for small \u03b5. So the leading term is this expression with \u03b5^{-4/5} dependence. Thus, that should be the answer.",
