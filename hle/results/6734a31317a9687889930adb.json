  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the expected value of R_T squared, where R_t is defined as e^(6B_t + 2t\u00b3 - t\u2074). Let me start by recalling some properties of Brownian motion and stochastic processes.\n\nFirst, R_t is given by an exponential function involving both the Brownian motion B_t and some deterministic functions of time. The expectation we need is E[R_T\u00b2]. Let me write that out explicitly. R_T squared would be e^(2*(6B_T + 2T\u00b3 - T\u2074)) which simplifies to e^(12B_T + 4T\u00b3 - 2T\u2074).\n\nSo E[R_T\u00b2] = E[e^{12B_T + 4T\u00b3 - 2T\u2074}]. Now, I can separate the terms into the exponential of a Brownian motion and the exponential of the deterministic part. Since 4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074 is deterministic, I can factor that out of the expectation. So this becomes e^(4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074) * E[e^{12B_T}].\n\nNow, the key part here is computing E[e^{12B_T}]. I remember that for a standard Brownian motion B_t, the moment generating function is E[e^{\u03bbB_t}] = e^{(\u03bb\u00b2 t)/2}. Let me verify that. Since B_t is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance t, the expectation of e^{\u03bbB_t} is the MGF of a normal distribution. The MGF for a normal variable with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3\u00b2 is e^{\u03bc\u03bb + (\u03c3\u00b2 \u03bb\u00b2)/2}. Here, \u03bc=0 and \u03c3\u00b2 = t, so it's e^{(\u03bb\u00b2 t)/2}. So applying that here with \u03bb=12, we get E[e^{12B_T}] = e^{(12\u00b2 * T)/2} = e^{(144 T)/2} = e^{72 T}.\n\nPutting it all together, the expectation becomes e^(4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074) * e^{72 T} = e^{72T +4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074}. \n\nWait, let me check if the exponent combines correctly. Yes, 4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074 comes from the original deterministic part multiplied by 2, and then adding 72T from the MGF part. So combining those terms gives 72T +4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074. Therefore, the expected value is e raised to that exponent. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm if there's any other adjustment needed. Since R_t is adapted to the Brownian filtration, there's no issue in taking the expectation here. Also, since we're dealing with It\u00f4 processes, but in this case, since we are using the moment generating function directly, the calculation seems straightforward. \n\nIs there any possibility that the process R_t is a martingale? If it were, then the expectation would just be the initial value. But let's see. If we consider R_t without the square, maybe that's a different story. But here we are dealing with R_T squared. The original question is about R_T squared, so perhaps the process itself isn't necessarily a martingale. But in any case, for this problem, we just need to compute the expectation using the MGF of Brownian motion, which seems to work here.\n\nSo my conclusion is that E[R_T\u00b2] = e^{72T +4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074}. Let me double-check the exponents:\n\nOriginal exponent in R_T: 6B_T + 2T\u00b3 - T\u2074. When we square R_T, multiply by 2: 12B_T + 4T\u00b3 - 2T\u2074. Then split into the deterministic part and the Brownian part. The deterministic part is 4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074, the Brownian part is 12B_T. Then the expectation of e^{12B_T} is e^{72T}, as earlier. Therefore, multiplying e^{4T\u00b3 -2T^4} by e^{72T} gives the exponent summing up. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be e^{72T +4T\u00b3 -2T\u2074}.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To compute \\(\\mathbb{E}[R_T^2]\\) where \\(R_T = e^{6B_T + 2T^3 - T^4}\\), we first express \\(R_T^2 = e^{12B_T + 4T^3 - 2T^4}\\).
