  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about calculating f(\u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p) mod p, where p is a Mersenne prime, specifically 2^127 - 1. First, I need to understand the function f and the definitions of \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p.\n\nThe function f is recursively defined. The base case is f(0,0,0) = 1, and if any of a, b, c are negative, it's 0. Otherwise, f(a,b,c) is the sum of f(a-1, b, c), f(a, b-2, c), and f(a, b, c-3). So, it's like a 3-dimensional recursive function where each dimension decreases by 1, 2, 3 respectively. Interesting.\n\nNow, the \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p are sums involving p raised to various exponents. Let's parse their definitions.\n\n\u03b1_p is the sum from i=0 to (3p -1)/2 of (p^{3i} + 3p^{3i+1} +4p^{3i+2}). Similarly for \u03b2_p and \u03b3_p. Wait, but the upper limit is (3p -1)/2. Hmm, since p is a prime, and 3p-1 over 2 must be an integer. Let's check for p odd. Since p is a Mersenne prime, which is always of the form 2^q -1, hence p is an odd prime. So 3p-1 is even, so (3p-1)/2 is an integer. So the sum goes up to that term.\n\nWait, the exponents in each term of \u03b1_p are 3i, 3i+1, 3i+2. So for each i, the terms are p^{3i}, p^{3i+1}, p^{3i+2}. So each group of three exponents is covered per i. So the sum for \u03b1_p is grouping terms in chunks of three exponents. For example, when i=0, the exponents are 0,1,2. For i=1, exponents 3,4,5. Etc., up to the upper limit.\n\nBut the upper limit is (3p -1)/2. Let's see: Each i corresponds to starting at 3i. The maximum exponent would be 3i + 2. Let's solve 3i + 2 <= (3p -1)/2. Wait, no. Wait, the upper limit for i is (3p -1)/2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the upper index is (3p -1)/2. But each term in the sum is up to i = (3p -1)/2. So the last term in the sum would have exponents 3*( (3p -1)/2 ), 3*((3p-1)/2)+1, 3*((3p-1)/2)+2. But that seems very large. Wait, but perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's check for a specific small prime p. Let's take p=3 (even though 3 isn't a Mersenne prime, but for testing the sum). Then (3*3 -1)/2 = (8)/2=4. So sum from i=0 to 4. Each term would be p^{3i} etc. But then for i=4, exponents would be 12,13,14. But p=3, so 3^12 is a big number. Wait, but maybe the sum is written correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\u03b1_p = sum_{i=0}^{(3p -1)/2} (p^{3i} +3p^{3i+1} +4p^{3i+2})\n\nSimilarly for \u03b2_p and \u03b3_p. So for each i, we have three terms. Let's compute the number of terms in the sum. Since i starts at 0 and goes up to (3p -1)/2 inclusive, the total number of terms is (3p -1)/2 +1 = (3p +1)/2. But each i contributes three exponents. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the upper limit is written as (3p -1)/2, but that might be because each exponent is in triplets. Wait, perhaps the sum is designed so that the exponents go up to some modulus? Wait, but the way it's written, for each i, the exponents are 3i, 3i+1, 3i+2. So when i increases by 1, the exponents increase by 3. So each group of three exponents is covered. For example, i=0: 0,1,2; i=1:3,4,5; etc. So the maximum exponent in the sum would be 3i +2, where i is (3p -1)/2. So the maximum exponent is 3*( (3p-1)/2 ) +2 = (9p -3)/2 +2 = (9p -3 +4)/2 = (9p +1)/2. But how does that relate to p? Not sure.\n\nBut maybe instead of trying to evaluate \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p directly, there's a pattern or generating function here.\n\nWait, but the problem is to compute f(\u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p) mod p. Since p is a prime, maybe we can use Lucas's theorem or some combinatorial interpretation. However, the function f is defined recursively with coefficients that decrease a, b, c by 1, 2, 3 respectively. It might relate to multinomial coefficients or some combinatorial paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function f(a,b,c) counts the number of ways to decrement a, b, c by those steps until reaching (0,0,0). So, for example, each step can take 1 from a, or 2 from b, or 3 from c. The total number of ways to reduce (a,b,c) to (0,0,0) by these steps. Then f(a,b,c) would be the number of such paths.\n\nIf that's the case, then the function f(a,b,c) can be expressed as a product of multinomial coefficients? Not sure. Alternatively, the generating function approach. The generating function would be F(x,y,z) = sum_{a,b,c} f(a,b,c) x^a y^b z^c. The recurrence relation gives F = 1 + xF + y^2 F + z^3 F. Solving for F, we get F = 1/(1 - x - y^2 - z^3). But that's a generating function, and the coefficients would be the number of compositions with parts of size 1 for a, 2 for b, 3 for c. Hmm, but how would that help in computing f(\u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p) mod p?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function f(a,b,c) can be represented as a product of terms. Wait, but the problem is for very large a, b, c. But since we're computing modulo p, maybe we can find a pattern or periodicity. Alternatively, since p is a prime, we can use Lucas's theorem. However, Lucas applies to binomial coefficients modulo primes, but here the function f is a different recursive function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to note that \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p are congruent to 0 mod p. Let's check. For example, \u03b1_p is a sum of terms involving p^{3i}, etc. Since p is prime, p^k mod p is 0 for k >=1. So in the sum for \u03b1_p, each term p^{3i} for i >= 1 is 0 mod p. The only term that might not be zero is when i=0. For i=0, the exponent is 0, so p^0 =1, and 3i+1=1, so 3p^{1}=3p, and 4p^{2} =4p^2. But 3p mod p is 0, and 4p^2 mod p is 0. Similarly, for i=0, p^{3i} =1, 3p^{3i+1}=3p, 4p^{3i+2}=4p\u00b2. So when considering \u03b1_p mod p, each term for i >=1 has p^{3i} which is 0 mod p, and 3p^{3i+1} is 0 mod p, and 4p^{3i+2} is 0 mod p. The only term that contributes is i=0: 1 + 3p +4p\u00b2. But then 3p mod p is 0, 4p\u00b2 mod p is 0, so \u03b1_p mod p is 1 +0 +0=1. Similarly for \u03b2_p and \u03b3_p.\n\nWait, let's check that. For example, take \u03b1_p:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{(3p -1)/2} (p^{3i} +3p^{3i+1} +4p^{3i+2}) mod p.\n\nEach term in the sum, for i >=1, 3i >=3 >=1, so p^{3i} mod p is 0. Similarly, 3p^{3i+1} mod p: 3i+1 >=3*1 +1=4 >=1, so p^{3i+1} mod p=0. Similarly 4p^{3i+2} mod p=0. So only i=0 contributes:\n\nFor i=0: p^0 +3p^1 +4p^2 mod p. p^0=1. 3p^1 mod p=0, 4p^2 mod p=0. So \u03b1_p mod p=1.\n\nSimilarly for \u03b2_p:\n\nsum (8p^{3i} +4p^{3i+1} +4p^{3i+2}) mod p.\n\nAgain, i=0 term:8 +4p +4p\u00b2 mod p. 8 +0 +0=8 mod p. But p is 2^127-1, which is a large prime. But 8 is less than p (since p is greater than 3). So \u03b2_p mod p=8.\n\nWait, but wait: i=0 term:8p^{0} +4p^{1} +4p^{2} mod p. p^0=1, p^1 mod p=0, p^2 mod p=0. So 8*1 +4*0 +4*0=8 mod p. Similarly, other terms for i>=1 are 8p^{3i} etc., which mod p are 0. So \u03b2_p mod p=8.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b3_p:\n\nsum (3p^{3i} +9p^{3i+1} +12p^{3i+2}) mod p.\n\ni=0 term:3*1 +9p +12p\u00b2 mod p. 3 +0 +0=3 mod p. Therefore \u03b3_p mod p=3.\n\nSo \u03b1_p \u22611 mod p, \u03b2_p \u22618 mod p, \u03b3_p \u22613 mod p.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute f(1,8,3) mod p. Wait, but since f(a,b,c) is defined for non-negative integers, and we have a=1, b=8, c=3. Then, since f(a,b,c) mod p is needed, and p is a large prime, maybe f(1,8,3) mod p can be computed directly.\n\nBut how do we compute f(1,8,3)?\n\nLet's compute f(1,8,3). The function f is recursively defined. Let's try to compute it step by step.\n\nBase case: f(0,0,0) =1.\n\nFor any a,b,c where any is negative, f=0.\n\nElse, f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3).\n\nSo, f(1,8,3) = f(0,8,3) + f(1,6,3) + f(1,8,0).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nf(0,8,3): since a=0, we need to see if we can reach (0,0,0) by decrementing b by 2 and c by 3. But starting from (0,8,3), which is a=0, b=8, c=3.\n\nSo f(0,8,3) = f(-1,8,3) + f(0,6,3) + f(0,8,0).\n\nBut f(-1,8,3)=0. f(0,8,0) is when c=0, so check if a and b can be reduced to 0. Starting from (0,8,0), the next step would be f(0-1,8,0) which is 0, f(0,8-2,0)=f(0,6,0), etc. But this seems recursive. Maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, note that the function f(a,b,c) is similar to counting the number of ways to decompose (a,b,c) into steps of (1,0,0), (0,2,0), and (0,0,3). So each step subtracts 1 from a, 2 from b, or 3 from c. So the total number of such paths.\n\nThis is similar to a generating function where the generating function is 1/(1 - x - y^2 - z^3). The coefficient of x^a y^b z^c would be f(a,b,c). But even if that's the case, it's not straightforward to compute the coefficients.\n\nBut since we need f(1,8,3) mod p, maybe we can compute it recursively. But with small parameters. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nCompute f(1,8,3):\n\nf(1,8,3) = f(0,8,3) + f(1,6,3) + f(1,8,0)\n\nCompute f(0,8,3):\n\nf(0,8,3) = f(-1,8,3) + f(0,6,3) + f(0,8,0)\nSince f(-1,8,3)=0, f(0,8,3)=0 + f(0,6,3) + f(0,8,0)\n\nSimilarly, f(0,6,3) = f(-1,6,3) + f(0,4,3) + f(0,6,0)\n=0 + f(0,4,3) + f(0,6,0)\n\nf(0,4,3) = f(-1,4,3) + f(0,2,3) + f(0,4,0)\n=0 + f(0,2,3) + f(0,4,0)\n\nf(0,2,3) = f(-1,2,3) + f(0,0,3) + f(0,2,0)\n=0 + f(0,0,3) + f(0,2,0)\n\nf(0,0,3) = f(-1,0,3) + f(0,-2,3) + f(0,0,0)\nBut a=-1 and b=-2 so both terms are 0, leaving f(0,0,3) =0 +0 +1=1.\n\nf(0,2,0) = f(-1,2,0) + f(0,0,0) + f(0,2,-3)\n=0 + f(0,0,0) +0 =1\n\nSo f(0,2,3) =1 +1=2.\n\nThen f(0,4,3) =2 + f(0,4,0)\n\nf(0,4,0) = f(-1,4,0) + f(0,2,0) + f(0,4,-3)\n=0 + f(0,2,0) +0 =1 (from earlier f(0,2,0)=1)\nSo f(0,4,3)=2 +1=3.\n\nThen f(0,6,3)=3 + f(0,6,0)\n\nf(0,6,0) =0 + f(0,4,0) +0 =1 (since f(0,4,0)=1 as computed)\nWait, no: f(0,6,0) = f(-1,6,0) + f(0,4,0) + f(0,6,-3)\n=0 + f(0,4,0) +0 = f(0,4,0) =1. So f(0,6,3)=3 +1=4.\n\nNow f(0,8,3) =4 + f(0,8,0)\n\nCompute f(0,8,0):\n\nf(0,8,0) =0 + f(0,6,0) +0 = f(0,6,0) =1 (from before). Wait, but earlier steps showed f(0,6,0)=1? Wait, let's check:\n\nWait f(0,6,0) = f(-1,6,0) + f(0,4,0) + f(0,6,-3) =0 +1 +0=1. Yes. Then f(0,8,0)= f(-1,8,0) + f(0,6,0) + f(0,8,-3) =0 +1 +0=1. So f(0,8,3)=4 +1=5.\n\nSo f(0,8,3)=5.\n\nNow compute f(1,6,3):\n\nf(1,6,3) = f(0,6,3) + f(1,4,3) + f(1,6,0)\n\nWe already have f(0,6,3)=4 from earlier.\n\nCompute f(1,4,3):\n\nf(1,4,3) = f(0,4,3) + f(1,2,3) + f(1,4,0)\n\nWe have f(0,4,3)=3 from earlier.\n\nCompute f(1,2,3):\n\nf(1,2,3) = f(0,2,3) + f(1,0,3) + f(1,2,0)\n\nf(0,2,3)=2 from earlier.\n\nCompute f(1,0,3):\n\nf(1,0,3) = f(0,0,3) + f(1,-2,3) + f(1,0,0)\n\nf(1,-2,3)=0 (b negative), f(1,0,0)=f(0,0,0)+f(1,-2,0)+f(1,0,-3)=1 +0 +0=1.\n\nSo f(1,0,3) =1 +0 +1=2.\n\nf(1,2,0) = f(0,2,0) + f(1,0,0) + f(1,2,-3)\n=2 (wait, f(0,2,0)=1, f(1,0,0)=1, f(1,2,-3)=0)\nSo f(1,2,0)=1 +1 +0=2.\n\nThus f(1,2,3)=2 +2 +2=6.\n\nNow f(1,4,3)=3 +6 + f(1,4,0)\n\nCompute f(1,4,0):\n\nf(1,4,0) = f(0,4,0) + f(1,2,0) + f(1,4,-3)\n=1 +2 +0=3.\n\nThus f(1,4,3)=3 +6 +3=12.\n\nNow back to f(1,6,3)=4 +12 + f(1,6,0)\n\nCompute f(1,6,0):\n\nf(1,6,0) = f(0,6,0) + f(1,4,0) + f(1,6,-3)\n=1 +3 +0=4.\n\nSo f(1,6,3)=4 +12 +4=20.\n\nNext, compute f(1,8,0):\n\nf(1,8,0) = f(0,8,0) + f(1,6,0) + f(1,8,-3)\n=1 +4 +0=5.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nf(1,8,3) = f(0,8,3) + f(1,6,3) + f(1,8,0) =5 +20 +5=30.\n\nSo f(1,8,3)=30. Then 30 mod p, where p is 2^127 -1. Since 30 is much smaller than p (which is a huge prime), 30 mod p is just 30. But wait, the problem says p=2^{127}-1. However, 30 is less than p (since p is about 2^127), so modulo p would be 30. But wait, wait. Wait, 30 mod (2^127 -1) is 30. But 2^127 -1 is a prime, yes, but does 30 need to be reduced modulo p? Since p is a prime larger than 30, yes, 30 mod p is 30. So the answer is 30 mod p=30.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's verify this conclusion. Wait, the problem says p=2^{127}-1, which is a very large prime. So 30 is less than p, so 30 mod p=30.\n\nBut wait, the problem could have a trick here. Because when I computed \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p mod p, I considered only the i=0 term, but what if there are other terms contributing when i is higher, but somehow the exponents modulo something. Wait, no, the exponents are 3i, which for any i>=1, p^{3i} has exponent at least 3, so p^{3i} mod p=0. Similarly, p^{3i+1} mod p=0, etc. So the sum for \u03b1_p mod p reduces to just the i=0 term. Therefore, the initial calculations are correct: \u03b1_p \u22611 mod p, \u03b2_p \u22618 mod p, \u03b3_p \u22613 mod p. Then f(1,8,3)=30, so 30 mod p=30.\n\nBut wait, the problem says p=2^{127}-1. Let me check if 30 is less than p. Since p=2^127 -1 is approximately 1.7e38, which is way larger than 30, so yes. Therefore, the answer should be 30 mod p=30.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to compute f(\u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p) mod p, which we've reduced to f(1,8,3) mod p=30 mod p=30. So the answer is 30.\n\nBut wait, the problem could have a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(a,b,c) can be expressed as a product of terms. For example, each step is independent. But since the recursion adds the three possibilities, perhaps the number of paths is a multinomial coefficient. Wait, but the steps are of different lengths. Each step uses one of three possible decrements. The total number of steps required to reach (0,0,0) from (a,b,c) would satisfy:\n\nThe number of steps of type 1 (decrement a by 1) is a', steps of type 2 (decrement b by 2) is b', steps of type 3 (decrement c by 3) is c', such that:\n\na' = a + k1? Wait, no. Wait, each step of type 1 reduces a by 1. So starting from a, you need exactly a steps of type 1. Similarly, each step of type 2 reduces b by 2, so you need b/2 steps. Similarly, c/3 steps. But this would only make sense if the steps are independent, but the recursion allows any order. Hmm, but this is only possible if a, b, c can be reduced to exactly zero by those steps. For example, if b is even and c is a multiple of 3.\n\nIn our case, a=1, b=8 (which is even), c=3 (which is divisible by 3). So yes, possible.\n\nWait, then the number of paths would be the multinomial coefficient:\n\n(a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! (b/2)! (c/3)! )\n\nWait, let's check. Suppose we have a steps of type 1 (each decrementing a by 1), b/2 steps of type 2 (each decrementing b by 2), and c/3 steps of type 3 (each decrementing c by 3). The total number of steps is a + b/2 + c/3. The number of ways to order these steps is the multinomial coefficient.\n\nBut in this case, a=1, b=8, c=3.\n\nSo steps needed:\n\n- 1 step of type 1 (since a=1)\n- 8/2=4 steps of type 2\n- 3/3=1 step of type 3\n\nTotal steps:1+4+1=6 steps.\n\nNumber of permutations:6!/(1!4!1!)=6*5/(1*1)=30. Which matches our earlier calculation of f(1,8,3)=30. So the formula is that if a, b, c are non-negative integers, and b is even, c is divisible by 3, then f(a,b,c) = (a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! (b/2)! (c/3)! )\n\nThis seems correct. So the general formula is:\n\nIf a, b, c are non-negative integers such that b is even, c is divisible by 3, then f(a,b,c) = multinomial coefficient ( (a + b/2 + c/3) ; a, b/2, c/3 ).\n\nOtherwise, if b is not even or c not divisible by 3, then there's no way to reach (0,0,0), so f(a,b,c)=0.\n\nBut wait, the original definition allows a, b, c to be any non-negative integers. So if, say, b is odd, then when you try to reduce b by steps of 2, you can't reach 0, hence f(a,b,c)=0. Similarly, if c is not divisible by 3, then you can't reduce c to 0 by subtracting 3, hence f(a,b,c)=0.\n\nIn our case, \u03b1_p mod p=1, which is okay, \u03b2_p mod p=8 (which is even), \u03b3_p mod p=3 (divisible by 3). So a=1, b=8, c=3, which satisfy the conditions. Thus, the number of paths is (1 + 8/2 + 3/3)! / (1! (8/2)! (3/3)! ) = (1 +4 +1)! / (1!4!1!)=6!/(1!4!1!)=720/(24*1)=30. Which matches our recursive computation.\n\nTherefore, the general formula applies here, and the answer is 30 mod p=30.\n\nThus, the final answer is 30.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The problem requires computing \\( f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\mod p \\), where \\( p = 2^{127} - 1 \\).

  "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about calculating f(\u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p) mod p, where p is a Mersenne prime, specifically 2^127 - 1. First, I need to understand the function f and the definitions of \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p.\n\nThe function f is recursively defined. The base case is f(0,0,0) = 1, and if any of a, b, c are negative, it's 0. Otherwise, f(a,b,c) is the sum of f(a-1, b, c), f(a, b-2, c), and f(a, b, c-3). So, it's like a 3-dimensional recursive function where each dimension decreases by 1, 2, 3 respectively. Interesting.\n\nNow, the \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p are sums involving p raised to various exponents. Let's parse their definitions.\n\n\u03b1_p is the sum from i=0 to (3p -1)/2 of (p^{3i} + 3p^{3i+1} +4p^{3i+2}). Similarly for \u03b2_p and \u03b3_p. Wait, but the upper limit is (3p -1)/2. Hmm, since p is a prime, and 3p-1 over 2 must be an integer. Let's check for p odd. Since p is a Mersenne prime, which is always of the form 2^q -1, hence p is an odd prime. So 3p-1 is even, so (3p-1)/2 is an integer. So the sum goes up to that term.\n\nWait, the exponents in each term of \u03b1_p are 3i, 3i+1, 3i+2. So for each i, the terms are p^{3i}, p^{3i+1}, p^{3i+2}. So each group of three exponents is covered per i. So the sum for \u03b1_p is grouping terms in chunks of three exponents. For example, when i=0, the exponents are 0,1,2. For i=1, exponents 3,4,5. Etc., up to the upper limit.\n\nBut the upper limit is (3p -1)/2. Let's see: Each i corresponds to starting at 3i. The maximum exponent would be 3i + 2. Let's solve 3i + 2 <= (3p -1)/2. Wait, no. Wait, the upper limit for i is (3p -1)/2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the upper index is (3p -1)/2. But each term in the sum is up to i = (3p -1)/2. So the last term in the sum would have exponents 3*( (3p -1)/2 ), 3*((3p-1)/2)+1, 3*((3p-1)/2)+2. But that seems very large. Wait, but perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's check for a specific small prime p. Let's take p=3 (even though 3 isn't a Mersenne prime, but for testing the sum). Then (3*3 -1)/2 = (8)/2=4. So sum from i=0 to 4. Each term would be p^{3i} etc. But then for i=4, exponents would be 12,13,14. But p=3, so 3^12 is a big number. Wait, but maybe the sum is written correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\u03b1_p = sum_{i=0}^{(3p -1)/2} (p^{3i} +3p^{3i+1} +4p^{3i+2})\n\nSimilarly for \u03b2_p and \u03b3_p. So for each i, we have three terms. Let's compute the number of terms in the sum. Since i starts at 0 and goes up to (3p -1)/2 inclusive, the total number of terms is (3p -1)/2 +1 = (3p +1)/2. But each i contributes three exponents. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the upper limit is written as (3p -1)/2, but that might be because each exponent is in triplets. Wait, perhaps the sum is designed so that the exponents go up to some modulus? Wait, but the way it's written, for each i, the exponents are 3i, 3i+1, 3i+2. So when i increases by 1, the exponents increase by 3. So each group of three exponents is covered. For example, i=0: 0,1,2; i=1:3,4,5; etc. So the maximum exponent in the sum would be 3i +2, where i is (3p -1)/2. So the maximum exponent is 3*( (3p-1)/2 ) +2 = (9p -3)/2 +2 = (9p -3 +4)/2 = (9p +1)/2. But how does that relate to p? Not sure.\n\nBut maybe instead of trying to evaluate \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p directly, there's a pattern or generating function here.\n\nWait, but the problem is to compute f(\u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p) mod p. Since p is a prime, maybe we can use Lucas's theorem or some combinatorial interpretation. However, the function f is defined recursively with coefficients that decrease a, b, c by 1, 2, 3 respectively. It might relate to multinomial coefficients or some combinatorial paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function f(a,b,c) counts the number of ways to decrement a, b, c by those steps until reaching (0,0,0). So, for example, each step can take 1 from a, or 2 from b, or 3 from c. The total number of ways to reduce (a,b,c) to (0,0,0) by these steps. Then f(a,b,c) would be the number of such paths.\n\nIf that's the case, then the function f(a,b,c) can be expressed as a product of multinomial coefficients? Not sure. Alternatively, the generating function approach. The generating function would be F(x,y,z) = sum_{a,b,c} f(a,b,c) x^a y^b z^c. The recurrence relation gives F = 1 + xF + y^2 F + z^3 F. Solving for F, we get F = 1/(1 - x - y^2 - z^3). But that's a generating function, and the coefficients would be the number of compositions with parts of size 1 for a, 2 for b, 3 for c. Hmm, but how would that help in computing f(\u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p) mod p?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function f(a,b,c) can be represented as a product of terms. Wait, but the problem is for very large a, b, c. But since we're computing modulo p, maybe we can find a pattern or periodicity. Alternatively, since p is a prime, we can use Lucas's theorem. However, Lucas applies to binomial coefficients modulo primes, but here the function f is a different recursive function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to note that \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p are congruent to 0 mod p. Let's check. For example, \u03b1_p is a sum of terms involving p^{3i}, etc. Since p is prime, p^k mod p is 0 for k >=1. So in the sum for \u03b1_p, each term p^{3i} for i >= 1 is 0 mod p. The only term that might not be zero is when i=0. For i=0, the exponent is 0, so p^0 =1, and 3i+1=1, so 3p^{1}=3p, and 4p^{2} =4p^2. But 3p mod p is 0, and 4p^2 mod p is 0. Similarly, for i=0, p^{3i} =1, 3p^{3i+1}=3p, 4p^{3i+2}=4p\u00b2. So when considering \u03b1_p mod p, each term for i >=1 has p^{3i} which is 0 mod p, and 3p^{3i+1} is 0 mod p, and 4p^{3i+2} is 0 mod p. The only term that contributes is i=0: 1 + 3p +4p\u00b2. But then 3p mod p is 0, 4p\u00b2 mod p is 0, so \u03b1_p mod p is 1 +0 +0=1. Similarly for \u03b2_p and \u03b3_p.\n\nWait, let's check that. For example, take \u03b1_p:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{(3p -1)/2} (p^{3i} +3p^{3i+1} +4p^{3i+2}) mod p.\n\nEach term in the sum, for i >=1, 3i >=3 >=1, so p^{3i} mod p is 0. Similarly, 3p^{3i+1} mod p: 3i+1 >=3*1 +1=4 >=1, so p^{3i+1} mod p=0. Similarly 4p^{3i+2} mod p=0. So only i=0 contributes:\n\nFor i=0: p^0 +3p^1 +4p^2 mod p. p^0=1. 3p^1 mod p=0, 4p^2 mod p=0. So \u03b1_p mod p=1.\n\nSimilarly for \u03b2_p:\n\nsum (8p^{3i} +4p^{3i+1} +4p^{3i+2}) mod p.\n\nAgain, i=0 term:8 +4p +4p\u00b2 mod p. 8 +0 +0=8 mod p. But p is 2^127-1, which is a large prime. But 8 is less than p (since p is greater than 3). So \u03b2_p mod p=8.\n\nWait, but wait: i=0 term:8p^{0} +4p^{1} +4p^{2} mod p. p^0=1, p^1 mod p=0, p^2 mod p=0. So 8*1 +4*0 +4*0=8 mod p. Similarly, other terms for i>=1 are 8p^{3i} etc., which mod p are 0. So \u03b2_p mod p=8.\n\nSimilarly, \u03b3_p:\n\nsum (3p^{3i} +9p^{3i+1} +12p^{3i+2}) mod p.\n\ni=0 term:3*1 +9p +12p\u00b2 mod p. 3 +0 +0=3 mod p. Therefore \u03b3_p mod p=3.\n\nSo \u03b1_p \u22611 mod p, \u03b2_p \u22618 mod p, \u03b3_p \u22613 mod p.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute f(1,8,3) mod p. Wait, but since f(a,b,c) is defined for non-negative integers, and we have a=1, b=8, c=3. Then, since f(a,b,c) mod p is needed, and p is a large prime, maybe f(1,8,3) mod p can be computed directly.\n\nBut how do we compute f(1,8,3)?\n\nLet's compute f(1,8,3). The function f is recursively defined. Let's try to compute it step by step.\n\nBase case: f(0,0,0) =1.\n\nFor any a,b,c where any is negative, f=0.\n\nElse, f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3).\n\nSo, f(1,8,3) = f(0,8,3) + f(1,6,3) + f(1,8,0).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nf(0,8,3): since a=0, we need to see if we can reach (0,0,0) by decrementing b by 2 and c by 3. But starting from (0,8,3), which is a=0, b=8, c=3.\n\nSo f(0,8,3) = f(-1,8,3) + f(0,6,3) + f(0,8,0).\n\nBut f(-1,8,3)=0. f(0,8,0) is when c=0, so check if a and b can be reduced to 0. Starting from (0,8,0), the next step would be f(0-1,8,0) which is 0, f(0,8-2,0)=f(0,6,0), etc. But this seems recursive. Maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, note that the function f(a,b,c) is similar to counting the number of ways to decompose (a,b,c) into steps of (1,0,0), (0,2,0), and (0,0,3). So each step subtracts 1 from a, 2 from b, or 3 from c. So the total number of such paths.\n\nThis is similar to a generating function where the generating function is 1/(1 - x - y^2 - z^3). The coefficient of x^a y^b z^c would be f(a,b,c). But even if that's the case, it's not straightforward to compute the coefficients.\n\nBut since we need f(1,8,3) mod p, maybe we can compute it recursively. But with small parameters. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nCompute f(1,8,3):\n\nf(1,8,3) = f(0,8,3) + f(1,6,3) + f(1,8,0)\n\nCompute f(0,8,3):\n\nf(0,8,3) = f(-1,8,3) + f(0,6,3) + f(0,8,0)\nSince f(-1,8,3)=0, f(0,8,3)=0 + f(0,6,3) + f(0,8,0)\n\nSimilarly, f(0,6,3) = f(-1,6,3) + f(0,4,3) + f(0,6,0)\n=0 + f(0,4,3) + f(0,6,0)\n\nf(0,4,3) = f(-1,4,3) + f(0,2,3) + f(0,4,0)\n=0 + f(0,2,3) + f(0,4,0)\n\nf(0,2,3) = f(-1,2,3) + f(0,0,3) + f(0,2,0)\n=0 + f(0,0,3) + f(0,2,0)\n\nf(0,0,3) = f(-1,0,3) + f(0,-2,3) + f(0,0,0)\nBut a=-1 and b=-2 so both terms are 0, leaving f(0,0,3) =0 +0 +1=1.\n\nf(0,2,0) = f(-1,2,0) + f(0,0,0) + f(0,2,-3)\n=0 + f(0,0,0) +0 =1\n\nSo f(0,2,3) =1 +1=2.\n\nThen f(0,4,3) =2 + f(0,4,0)\n\nf(0,4,0) = f(-1,4,0) + f(0,2,0) + f(0,4,-3)\n=0 + f(0,2,0) +0 =1 (from earlier f(0,2,0)=1)\nSo f(0,4,3)=2 +1=3.\n\nThen f(0,6,3)=3 + f(0,6,0)\n\nf(0,6,0) =0 + f(0,4,0) +0 =1 (since f(0,4,0)=1 as computed)\nWait, no: f(0,6,0) = f(-1,6,0) + f(0,4,0) + f(0,6,-3)\n=0 + f(0,4,0) +0 = f(0,4,0) =1. So f(0,6,3)=3 +1=4.\n\nNow f(0,8,3) =4 + f(0,8,0)\n\nCompute f(0,8,0):\n\nf(0,8,0) =0 + f(0,6,0) +0 = f(0,6,0) =1 (from before). Wait, but earlier steps showed f(0,6,0)=1? Wait, let's check:\n\nWait f(0,6,0) = f(-1,6,0) + f(0,4,0) + f(0,6,-3) =0 +1 +0=1. Yes. Then f(0,8,0)= f(-1,8,0) + f(0,6,0) + f(0,8,-3) =0 +1 +0=1. So f(0,8,3)=4 +1=5.\n\nSo f(0,8,3)=5.\n\nNow compute f(1,6,3):\n\nf(1,6,3) = f(0,6,3) + f(1,4,3) + f(1,6,0)\n\nWe already have f(0,6,3)=4 from earlier.\n\nCompute f(1,4,3):\n\nf(1,4,3) = f(0,4,3) + f(1,2,3) + f(1,4,0)\n\nWe have f(0,4,3)=3 from earlier.\n\nCompute f(1,2,3):\n\nf(1,2,3) = f(0,2,3) + f(1,0,3) + f(1,2,0)\n\nf(0,2,3)=2 from earlier.\n\nCompute f(1,0,3):\n\nf(1,0,3) = f(0,0,3) + f(1,-2,3) + f(1,0,0)\n\nf(1,-2,3)=0 (b negative), f(1,0,0)=f(0,0,0)+f(1,-2,0)+f(1,0,-3)=1 +0 +0=1.\n\nSo f(1,0,3) =1 +0 +1=2.\n\nf(1,2,0) = f(0,2,0) + f(1,0,0) + f(1,2,-3)\n=2 (wait, f(0,2,0)=1, f(1,0,0)=1, f(1,2,-3)=0)\nSo f(1,2,0)=1 +1 +0=2.\n\nThus f(1,2,3)=2 +2 +2=6.\n\nNow f(1,4,3)=3 +6 + f(1,4,0)\n\nCompute f(1,4,0):\n\nf(1,4,0) = f(0,4,0) + f(1,2,0) + f(1,4,-3)\n=1 +2 +0=3.\n\nThus f(1,4,3)=3 +6 +3=12.\n\nNow back to f(1,6,3)=4 +12 + f(1,6,0)\n\nCompute f(1,6,0):\n\nf(1,6,0) = f(0,6,0) + f(1,4,0) + f(1,6,-3)\n=1 +3 +0=4.\n\nSo f(1,6,3)=4 +12 +4=20.\n\nNext, compute f(1,8,0):\n\nf(1,8,0) = f(0,8,0) + f(1,6,0) + f(1,8,-3)\n=1 +4 +0=5.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nf(1,8,3) = f(0,8,3) + f(1,6,3) + f(1,8,0) =5 +20 +5=30.\n\nSo f(1,8,3)=30. Then 30 mod p, where p is 2^127 -1. Since 30 is much smaller than p (which is a huge prime), 30 mod p is just 30. But wait, the problem says p=2^{127}-1. However, 30 is less than p (since p is about 2^127), so modulo p would be 30. But wait, wait. Wait, 30 mod (2^127 -1) is 30. But 2^127 -1 is a prime, yes, but does 30 need to be reduced modulo p? Since p is a prime larger than 30, yes, 30 mod p is 30. So the answer is 30 mod p=30.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's verify this conclusion. Wait, the problem says p=2^{127}-1, which is a very large prime. So 30 is less than p, so 30 mod p=30.\n\nBut wait, the problem could have a trick here. Because when I computed \u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p mod p, I considered only the i=0 term, but what if there are other terms contributing when i is higher, but somehow the exponents modulo something. Wait, no, the exponents are 3i, which for any i>=1, p^{3i} has exponent at least 3, so p^{3i} mod p=0. Similarly, p^{3i+1} mod p=0, etc. So the sum for \u03b1_p mod p reduces to just the i=0 term. Therefore, the initial calculations are correct: \u03b1_p \u22611 mod p, \u03b2_p \u22618 mod p, \u03b3_p \u22613 mod p. Then f(1,8,3)=30, so 30 mod p=30.\n\nBut wait, the problem says p=2^{127}-1. Let me check if 30 is less than p. Since p=2^127 -1 is approximately 1.7e38, which is way larger than 30, so yes. Therefore, the answer should be 30 mod p=30.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to compute f(\u03b1_p, \u03b2_p, \u03b3_p) mod p, which we've reduced to f(1,8,3) mod p=30 mod p=30. So the answer is 30.\n\nBut wait, the problem could have a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(a,b,c) can be expressed as a product of terms. For example, each step is independent. But since the recursion adds the three possibilities, perhaps the number of paths is a multinomial coefficient. Wait, but the steps are of different lengths. Each step uses one of three possible decrements. The total number of steps required to reach (0,0,0) from (a,b,c) would satisfy:\n\nThe number of steps of type 1 (decrement a by 1) is a', steps of type 2 (decrement b by 2) is b', steps of type 3 (decrement c by 3) is c', such that:\n\na' = a + k1? Wait, no. Wait, each step of type 1 reduces a by 1. So starting from a, you need exactly a steps of type 1. Similarly, each step of type 2 reduces b by 2, so you need b/2 steps. Similarly, c/3 steps. But this would only make sense if the steps are independent, but the recursion allows any order. Hmm, but this is only possible if a, b, c can be reduced to exactly zero by those steps. For example, if b is even and c is a multiple of 3.\n\nIn our case, a=1, b=8 (which is even), c=3 (which is divisible by 3). So yes, possible.\n\nWait, then the number of paths would be the multinomial coefficient:\n\n(a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! (b/2)! (c/3)! )\n\nWait, let's check. Suppose we have a steps of type 1 (each decrementing a by 1), b/2 steps of type 2 (each decrementing b by 2), and c/3 steps of type 3 (each decrementing c by 3). The total number of steps is a + b/2 + c/3. The number of ways to order these steps is the multinomial coefficient.\n\nBut in this case, a=1, b=8, c=3.\n\nSo steps needed:\n\n- 1 step of type 1 (since a=1)\n- 8/2=4 steps of type 2\n- 3/3=1 step of type 3\n\nTotal steps:1+4+1=6 steps.\n\nNumber of permutations:6!/(1!4!1!)=6*5/(1*1)=30. Which matches our earlier calculation of f(1,8,3)=30. So the formula is that if a, b, c are non-negative integers, and b is even, c is divisible by 3, then f(a,b,c) = (a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! (b/2)! (c/3)! )\n\nThis seems correct. So the general formula is:\n\nIf a, b, c are non-negative integers such that b is even, c is divisible by 3, then f(a,b,c) = multinomial coefficient ( (a + b/2 + c/3) ; a, b/2, c/3 ).\n\nOtherwise, if b is not even or c not divisible by 3, then there's no way to reach (0,0,0), so f(a,b,c)=0.\n\nBut wait, the original definition allows a, b, c to be any non-negative integers. So if, say, b is odd, then when you try to reduce b by steps of 2, you can't reach 0, hence f(a,b,c)=0. Similarly, if c is not divisible by 3, then you can't reduce c to 0 by subtracting 3, hence f(a,b,c)=0.\n\nIn our case, \u03b1_p mod p=1, which is okay, \u03b2_p mod p=8 (which is even), \u03b3_p mod p=3 (divisible by 3). So a=1, b=8, c=3, which satisfy the conditions. Thus, the number of paths is (1 + 8/2 + 3/3)! / (1! (8/2)! (3/3)! ) = (1 +4 +1)! / (1!4!1!)=6!/(1!4!1!)=720/(24*1)=30. Which matches our recursive computation.\n\nTherefore, the general formula applies here, and the answer is 30 mod p=30.\n\nThus, the final answer is 30.",
