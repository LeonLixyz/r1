  "question": "Find the curvature for the graph of f(x) = x5/5 \u2212 x. Where is the curvature\nmaximal?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find where the curvature of the function f(x) = (x^5)/5 - x is maximal. Hmm, curvature... I remember from my calculus class that curvature measures how much the curve is bending at a point. The formula for curvature involves the first and second derivatives of the function. Let me try to recall the exact formula.\n\nRight, the curvature \u03ba (kappa) for a function y = f(x) is given by:\n\n\u03ba = |f''(x)| / [1 + (f'(x))^2]^(3/2)\n\nSo first, I need to find the first and second derivatives of f(x). Let's compute those.\n\nf(x) = (x^5)/5 - x\n\nFirst derivative, f'(x): The derivative of x^5/5 is x^4, and the derivative of -x is -1. So f'(x) = x^4 - 1.\n\nSecond derivative, f''(x): The derivative of x^4 is 4x^3, and the derivative of -1 is 0. So f''(x) = 4x^3.\n\nNow, plug these into the curvature formula:\n\n\u03ba = |4x^3| / [1 + (x^4 - 1)^2]^(3/2)\n\nSince we're dealing with absolute value in the numerator, and x^3's sign depends on x, but when squared, it's all positive. Wait, but here the numerator is |4x^3|, which simplifies to 4|x^3|. But since x^3 is positive when x>0 and negative when x<0, the absolute value makes it 4|x|^3. Maybe that's a better way to write it? Anyway, the point is the numerator is 4|x|\u00b3.\n\nSo the curvature becomes:\n\n\u03ba = 4|x|\u00b3 / [1 + (x^4 - 1)^2]^(3/2)\n\nNow, the question is asking where this curvature is maximal. So I need to find the value(s) of x where \u03ba is maximized. To find the maximum of \u03ba, I should take the derivative of \u03ba with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. But this might get complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the curvature is a function of x, maybe I can analyze its critical points by taking the derivative d\u03ba/dx and solving for when it's zero. But the expression for \u03ba is a bit complex. Let's denote the denominator as D = [1 + (x^4 - 1)^2]^(3/2). Then \u03ba = 4|x|\u00b3 / D. To maximize \u03ba, since the numerator and denominator are both positive (except at x=0, but let's check that), we can consider the function without the absolute value for x \u2260 0 and see where it's maximized.\n\nWait, but maybe considering x \u2265 0 and x < 0 separately would help due to the |x|\u00b3 term. However, since the function f(x) is an odd function? Let's check. f(-x) = (-x)^5/5 - (-x) = -x^5/5 + x = -(x^5/5 -x) + 2x? Wait, no. Let's see: ( (-x)^5 ) /5 = -x^5/5, and -(-x) = x. So f(-x) = -x^5/5 +x, which is not the same as -f(x) because the original f(x) is x^5/5 -x. So f(-x) = -x^5/5 +x = -(x^5/5 -x) + 2x? Hmm maybe not exactly odd. Wait, perhaps it's symmetric in some way? Maybe not. Let me check f(-x) = -x^5/5 +x. Whereas -f(x) = -x^5/5 +x. Wait, that's the same as f(-x). So f(-x) = -f(x). So actually, f is an odd function. Because f(-x) = -f(x). That's good to know because curvature for an odd function might have some symmetry. Let me confirm that.\n\nIf f is odd, then f(-x) = -f(x). Then f'(-x) = derivative of f(-x) = f'(-x)*(-1) = -f'(x). Wait, derivative of f(-x) is f'(-x)*(-1), so f' is even? Because f'(-x) = -f'(x)*(-1) = f'(x). Wait, no, let me redo:\n\nIf f(-x) = -f(x), then taking derivative on both sides:\n\nd/dx [f(-x)] = d/dx [-f(x)]\n\nLeft side: f'(-x)*(-1)\n\nRight side: -f'(x)\n\nThus, -f'(-x) = -f'(x) \u2192 f'(-x) = f'(x). So f\u2019 is even. So f\u2019 is even function. Then f\u2019(x) = x^4 -1, which is even (since x^4 is even and -1 is even). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, the second derivative f''(x) = 4x^3, which is an odd function. Because 4(-x)^3 = -4x^3.\n\nSo curvature formula \u03ba(x) = |f''(x)| / [1 + (f\u2019(x))^2]^3/2 = |4x^3| / [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^3/2.\n\nBut since the denominator is even in x (because (x^4 -1)^2 is same for x and -x), and the numerator is |4x^3| = 4|x|^3, which is even function (since |x|^3 is same for x and -x). Therefore, \u03ba(x) is an even function. So the curvature at x and -x will be the same. Therefore, the maximal curvature points will be symmetric around the y-axis. So if there is a maximum at x = a, there will be another at x = -a. But let's check if that's the case.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum occurs at x=0? Let me check \u03ba(0). At x=0, the numerator is 0, so \u03ba(0) = 0. So curvature is zero there. So the curvature is zero at x=0. Therefore, the maximum curvature is not there.\n\nSo maybe the maximum curvature occurs at some other points. Let's try plugging in some values.\n\nFor example, x=1: f'(1) = 1^4 -1 = 0. f''(1) =4*1^3=4. So \u03ba(1) = |4| / [1 +0]^3/2 = 4/1 =4.\n\nAt x=1, \u03ba=4.\n\nAt x= -1, similarly \u03ba(-1)= |4*(-1)^3| / [1 +0]^3/2= 4/1=4. Same.\n\nNow, what about x=0. Let's see, at x=0.5:\n\nf'(0.5)= (0.5)^4 -1 = 0.0625 -1= -0.9375. So (f')\u00b2 = (0.9375)^2 \u2248 0.8789. Denominator becomes [1 +0.8789]^(3/2)= (1.8789)^(3/2). Let's compute that:\n\n1.8789^(1/2) \u2248 1.3707, so 1.3707^3 \u2248 2.575. So denominator \u22482.575. Numerator is 4*(0.5)^3=4*(0.125)=0.5. So \u03ba\u22480.5 /2.575\u22480.194.\n\nAt x=1, \u03ba=4. At x=0.5, \u03ba\u22480.194. So much smaller.\n\nWhat about x=1.5?\n\nf'(1.5)= (1.5)^4 -1= (5.0625) -1=4.0625. So (f')\u00b2\u224816.5039. Denominator: [1 +16.5039]^(3/2)=17.5039^(3/2). Let's compute sqrt(17.5039)=~4.184. Then 4.184^3 \u2248 73.3. Numerator is 4*(1.5)^3=4*(3.375)=13.5. So \u03ba\u224813.5 /73.3\u22480.184. So even smaller than at x=0.5. So curvature is decreasing as x moves away from 1 in the positive direction beyond 1.\n\nWait, but at x=1, the curvature is 4. At x=0.5, it's about 0.194, which is much lower. So maybe the curvature is maximized at x=1 and x=-1? Because when we plug in x=1, we get \u03ba=4, which is higher than around there.\n\nBut wait, let's check x=0. Let's check x approaching 1 from below, say x=0.9:\n\nf'(0.9)=0.9^4 -1 \u22480.6561 -1= -0.3439. (f')\u00b2\u22480.1182. Denominator: [1 +0.1182]^(3/2)=1.1182^(3/2). Square root is 1.057, then raised to 3: \u22481.057^3\u22481.18. Numerator:4*(0.9)^3\u22484*0.729=2.916. So \u03ba\u22482.916/1.18\u22482.47. Which is less than 4 at x=1.\n\nWait, so at x=1, the curvature is 4, but as x approaches 1 from the left, curvature increases to 4. Let me check x=1. Let's see, at exactly x=1, f'(1)=0, so denominator is [1+0]^(3/2)=1. So numerator is 4*1=4. So \u03ba=4. What about as x approaches 1 from the right? Let's take x=1.1:\n\nf'(1.1)= (1.1)^4 -1\u22481.4641 -1=0.4641. (f')\u00b2\u22480.215. Denominator: [1 +0.215]^(3/2)=1.215^(3/2). Square root is approximately 1.102, then cube is ~1.102^3\u22481.337. Numerator:4*(1.1)^3\u22484*1.331=5.324. So \u03ba\u22485.324/1.337\u22483.98. That's very close to 4, but slightly less. Wait, but maybe this is due to approximation errors. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, if x=1, \u03ba=4. For x slightly larger than 1, like x=1.01:\n\nCompute f'(1.01) = (1.01)^4 -1 \u22481.040604 -1 =0.040604. So (f')\u00b2\u22480.001649. Denominator:1.001649^(3/2). The square root is approximately sqrt(1.001649)=1.000824. Then raising to the 3rd power: (1.000824)^3\u22481.00247. The numerator is 4*(1.01)^3\u22484*(1.030301)=4.1212. So \u03ba\u22484.1212 /1.00247\u22484.11. Which is slightly higher than 4? Wait, that contradicts previous thought.\n\nWait, but maybe my calculation is off. Let me compute (1.01)^4:\n\n1.01^4 = (1 +0.01)^4 \u22481 +4*0.01 +6*(0.01)^2 +4*(0.01)^3 + (0.01)^4\u22481 +0.04 +0.0006 +0.000004 +0.00000001\u22481.040604. So correct. So f'(1.01)=0.040604. Then (f')\u00b2\u22480.040604^2\u22480.001649. So denominator is [1 +0.001649]^(3/2)= (1.001649)^(3/2). Let me compute sqrt(1.001649) first. The square root of 1.001649 is approximately 1.000824 (since (1.000824)^2=1 +2*0.000824 + (0.000824)^2\u22481 +0.001648 +0.000000678\u22481.001648678). So sqrt(1.001649)\u22481.000824. Then raising to the 3/2 power: (1.000824)^3\u22481.00247. So denominator\u22481.00247.\n\nNumerator:4*(1.01)^3=4*(1.030301)=4.121204. So \u03ba\u22484.121204 /1.00247\u22484.111. So that's a bit higher than 4. Wait, so at x=1.01, \u03ba\u22484.11, which is higher than at x=1. So that suggests that the curvature might have a maximum slightly above x=1? But wait, at x=1, the denominator is 1, and numerator is 4*1=4, so \u03ba=4. But at x=1.01, \u03ba is higher. That's interesting. So maybe the maximum is not exactly at x=1. Let's check this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum curvature is achieved at x=1. But when I compute x=1.01, the curvature increases. So perhaps the maximum is not at x=1.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Perhaps I need to take the derivative of \u03ba with respect to x and find where it's zero.\n\nSo let's set up the function \u03ba(x) = 4|x|\u00b3 / [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). For x > 0, we can drop the absolute value: \u03ba(x) =4x\u00b3 / [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Let's consider x >0 and compute the derivative d\u03ba/dx.\n\nLet me denote N =4x\u00b3, D = [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Then \u03ba = N/D. The derivative is (N' D - N D') / D\u00b2.\n\nFirst compute N' = 12x\u00b2.\n\nCompute D = [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Let me let u =1 + (x^4 -1)^2. Then D= u^(3/2). So D' = (3/2)u^(1/2) * d/dx [u].\n\nCompute d/dx [u] = d/dx [1 + (x^4 -1)^2] = 2(x^4 -1)(4x\u00b3) =8x\u00b3(x^4 -1).\n\nTherefore, D' = (3/2)u^(1/2)*8x\u00b3(x^4 -1) =12x\u00b3(x^4 -1)*u^(1/2).\n\nNow, putting it into the derivative:\n\nd\u03ba/dx = [12x\u00b2 * D - N* D'] / D\u00b2\n\n= [12x\u00b2 * u^(3/2) -4x\u00b3 *12x\u00b3(x^4 -1) u^(1/2)] / u^3\n\nFactor out terms:\n\n= [12x\u00b2 u^(3/2) -48x^6 (x^4 -1) u^(1/2)] / u^3\n\nFactor 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) from numerator:\n\n=12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) [u -4x^4(x^4 -1)] / u^3\n\nSimplify:\n\n=12x\u00b2 [u -4x^4(x^4 -1)] / u^(3/2)\n\nBut u=1 + (x^4 -1)^2. Let's expand that:\n\n(x^4 -1)^2 =x^8 -2x^4 +1. So u=1 +x^8 -2x^4 +1= x^8 -2x^4 +2.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n=12x\u00b2 [x^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^4(x^4 -1)] / [x^8 -2x^4 +2]^(3/2)\n\nSimplify the numerator in the brackets:\n\nx^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^4(x^4 -1) =x^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^8 +4x^4 = (x^8 -4x^8) + (-2x^4 +4x^4) +2 = (-3x^8) +2x^4 +2.\n\nSo the derivative d\u03ba/dx becomes:\n\n12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) / [x^8 -2x^4 +2]^(3/2)\n\nSet this equal to zero to find critical points. The denominator is always positive, so the critical points occur when the numerator is zero:\n\n12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) =0\n\nSet 12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) =0 \u2192 Either x=0 (but we are considering x>0), or -3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0.\n\nSo solve -3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0. Let's make substitution y =x^4. Then equation becomes:\n\n-3y\u00b2 +2y +2=0 \u2192 multiply both sides by -1:3y\u00b2 -2y -2=0.\n\nSolve quadratic equation: y = [2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +24)]/(6) = [2 \u00b1\u221a28]/6 = [2 \u00b12\u221a7]/6 = [1 \u00b1\u221a7]/3.\n\nSince y=x^4 \u22650, we check which roots are positive:\n\n[1 +\u221a7]/3 \u2248 (1 +2.6458)/3\u22483.6458/3\u22481.215 (positive)\n\n[1 -\u221a7]/3\u2248(1-2.6458)/3\u2248(-1.6458)/3\u2248-0.5486 (negative). Discard negative root.\n\nThus, y=[1 +\u221a7]/3 \u2192x^4= [1 +\u221a7]/3 \u2192x= ([1 +\u221a7]/3 )^(1/4). Let's compute approximate value:\n\nFirst, compute [1 +\u221a7]\u22481 +2.6458\u22483.6458. Divide by 3:\u22481.2153. Then take the 4th root. Since 1.2153 is approximately 1.2153^0.25. Let me compute:\n\nLet me note that 1.2^4= (1.2)^2*(1.2)^2=1.44*1.44=2.0736. Which is more than 1.2153. Wait, but we need a number x such that x^4=1.2153. Let's see:\n\n(1.05)^4 = approx (1.05)^2=1.1025, squared again:1.1025^2\u22481.2155. So, (1.05)^4\u22481.2155, which is very close to 1.2153. So approximately x\u22481.05. So x\u2248( [1 +\u221a7]/3 )^(1/4)\u22481.05. So critical point at x\u22481.05.\n\nTherefore, the derivative is zero at x\u22481.05. So this is where the curvature might be maximum for x>0. Similarly, due to symmetry, the same applies at x\u2248-1.05.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed at x=1.01, the curvature was around 4.11, which is higher than at x=1. So perhaps the maximum is around x\u22481.05.\n\nBut wait, the question asks where the curvature is maximal. So according to this analysis, there are critical points at x\u2248\u00b11.05. But maybe that's the case.\n\nBut to confirm, let's compute the curvature at x=1.05. Let's approximate.\n\nFirst, compute x=1.05:\n\nCompute f'(1.05)=x^4 -1= (1.05)^4 -1\u22481.2155 -1=0.2155. So (f')\u00b2\u22480.0464. Denominator:1 +0.0464=1.0464. Raise to 3/2 power: (1.0464)^(3/2). sqrt(1.0464)=\u22481.0229, then cube:\u22481.0229^3\u22481.070. So denominator\u22481.070. Numerator=4*(1.05)^3\u22484*1.1576\u22484.6304. So \u03ba\u22484.6304 /1.070\u22484.327.\n\nAt x=1.05, \u03ba\u22484.327. Which is higher than at x=1.01. Then, perhaps the maximum is around x=1.05. Similarly, for x=1.1, we saw \u03ba\u22483.98, which is lower. So maybe the curvature peaks around x\u22481.05.\n\nBut solving for x exactly would require solving that quartic equation, which is complicated. However, the problem is asking where the curvature is maximal, and the answer options might expect a simpler answer. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go back to the derivative calculation. When I set up the equation for critical points, I had:\n\n-3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0 \u2192 Let's check the coefficients again.\n\nThe numerator after simplifying was -3x^8 +2x^4 +2. So the equation is -3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0 \u2192 3x^8 -2x^4 -2=0. Then substitution y=x^4 gives 3y\u00b2 -2y -2=0, which has roots y=(2\u00b1\u221a(4 +24))/6=(2\u00b1\u221a28)/6=(2\u00b12\u221a7)/6=(1\u00b1\u221a7)/3. As before, y positive is (1+\u221a7)/3\u22481.215. So x= ( (1+\u221a7)/3 )^(1/4).\n\nBut perhaps this can be expressed as exact form. Let me compute:\n\nLet me compute 1+\u221a7\u22483.6458. Divided by3\u22481.2153. Then taking the 4th root. But I don't know a simpler form for that. So the exact point where curvature is maximized is x=\u00b1 [ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^(1/4). But maybe the question expects an approximate answer? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum curvature occurs at x=1 and x=-1. But according to the derivative, the critical points are at x\u2248\u00b11.05. However, when I computed at x=1, the curvature was 4, but at x=1.05, it's higher. So perhaps the answer is not at x=\u00b11. But the problem is asking where the curvature is maximal, so according to this, it's at those critical points. But since the problem might expect a simpler answer, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the derivative calculation again.\n\nWe started with \u03ba =4x\u00b3 / D, where D= [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Then the derivative d\u03ba/dx = [12x\u00b2 D -4x\u00b3 D'] / D\u00b2.\n\nThen D' is derivative of D: let's recompute that.\n\nLet me write D = [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Let u =1 + (x^4 -1)^2. So D = u^(3/2). Then dD/dx = (3/2)u^(1/2) * derivative of u.\n\nDerivative of u is derivative of (x^4 -1)^2: 2(x^4 -1)(4x^3) =8x^3(x^4 -1). So D'= (3/2)*u^(1/2)*8x^3(x^4 -1) =12x^3(x^4 -1)u^(1/2).\n\nSo substituting into the derivative:\n\nd\u03ba/dx = [12x\u00b2 * u^(3/2) -4x\u00b3 *12x^3(x^4 -1) u^(1/2)] / u^3\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) [u -4x^6 (x^4 -1)] / u^3\n\nWait, here's a mistake. Because in the second term, 4x\u00b3 *12x^3(x^4 -1) u^(1/2) is 48x^6(x^4 -1)u^(1/2). But in the denominator, it's D\u00b2 = u^3. So numerator is 12x\u00b2 u^(3/2) -48x^6(x^4 -1)u^(1/2). Then factor out 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2):\n\n=12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) [u -4x^4(x^4 -1)] / u^3\n\nWait, wait: 12x\u00b2 u^(3/2) is 12x\u00b2 * u^(3/2), and the second term is 48x^6(x^4 -1)u^(1/2). So when factoring 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2), the first term becomes 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) * u, and the second term is 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) * (-4x^4(x^4 -1)). Therefore, the term inside the brackets is [u -4x^4(x^4 -1)].\n\nBut u =1 + (x^4 -1)^2 =1 +x^8 -2x^4 +1 =x^8 -2x^4 +2.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n[u -4x^4(x^4 -1)] = x^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^4(x^4 -1) =x^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^8 +4x^4 = (-3x^8) +2x^4 +2. That's correct.\n\nThus, the numerator is 12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) and denominator is u^{3/2} = [x^8 -2x^4 +2]^{3/2}\n\nSo setting numerator equal to zero:\n\n12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2)=0. For x>0, x\u22600, so solve -3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0 \u2192 3x^8 -2x^4 -2=0\n\nSubstitution y=x^4 gives 3y\u00b2 -2y -2=0. Solution:\n\ny = [2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +24)]/6 = [2 \u00b1\u221a28]/6 = [2 \u00b12\u221a7]/6 = [1 \u00b1\u221a7]/3. Only positive solution is y=(1 +\u221a7)/3.\n\nThus, x= [ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}\n\nCalculating numerically:\n\n1 +\u221a7 \u22481 +2.6458\u22483.6458. Divided by3\u22481.2153. Then 1.2153^{1/4}:\n\n1.2153^(1/4) can be approximated as follows: since 1.2^4=2.0736, which is larger than 1.2153. So maybe take log:\n\nln(1.2153)\u22480.196. Then (1/4)*0.196\u22480.049. So e^{0.049}\u22481.05. So x\u22481.05.\n\nThus, the critical points are at x\u2248\u00b11.05. Therefore, the curvature is maximal at x\u2248\u00b11.05.\n\nBut the problem asks \"Where is the curvature maximal?\" So it's expecting an answer in terms of x. If they accept exact form, it's x=\u00b1[ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. But this is quite complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, or maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, but maybe we can check second derivative test at x=1. Let's see. If x=1 is a critical point, but according to the earlier derivative calculation, when x=1, the numerator of d\u03ba/dx is:\n\n12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) at x=1:\n\n12*1^2*(-3*1^8 +2*1^4 +2)=12*(-3 +2 +2)=12*(1)=12>0. So at x=1, the derivative is positive, meaning that \u03ba is increasing at x=1. Thus, if the derivative is positive at x=1, then the maximum must be at a point where x>1. Wait, but earlier when I computed x=1.01, the curvature was increasing. But according to the critical point calculation, the maximum is at x\u22481.05.\n\nWait, but when I plug in x=1 into the derivative, the numerator is 12x\u00b2(-3x^8 +2x^4 +2). At x=1, that gives 12*1*(-3 +2 +2)=12*(1)=12. Which is positive. So at x=1, the derivative of \u03ba is positive, meaning that as x increases past 1, \u03ba is increasing. So the curvature is increasing at x=1, which suggests that the maximum is not at x=1, but somewhere after. So the critical point at x\u22481.05 is the maximum.\n\nBut this seems to contradict my earlier thought that at x=1, curvature is 4, and around x=1.01, it's higher. So that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, according to this analysis, the curvature is maximal at x\u2248\u00b11.05. But how can we express this exact value?\n\nThe exact value is x=\u00b1[ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. Let's see if this can be simplified.\n\n(1 +\u221a7)/3 = (1 +\u221a7)/3. So x= [ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. Alternatively, maybe rationalizing or other steps, but I think that's as simple as it gets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an answer of x=\u00b11, but according to the calculations, that's not the case. But maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if the curvature has its maximum at x=1. Let's compute the second derivative at the critical point x\u22481.05 to confirm if it's a maximum.\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Alternatively, since the curvature increases beyond x=1 up to x\u22481.05 and then decreases, that critical point must be the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the curvature is maximal at x=\u00b1 [ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach or a simplification.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the derivative calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I computed the derivative, the critical points are where d\u03ba/dx=0. But in the numerator, after substituting, we have:\n\n-3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0. So the equation is 3x^8 -2x^4 -2=0. Let me check with x=1.05:\n\nCompute 3*(1.05)^8 -2*(1.05)^4 -2.\n\nFirst, (1.05)^4\u22481.2155. Then (1.05)^8\u2248(1.2155)^2\u22481.4775.\n\nSo 3*1.4775\u22484.4325. Then 2*(1.2155)\u22482.431. So 4.4325 -2.431 -2\u22484.4325 -4.431\u22480.0015. Close to zero. Thus, x=1.05 is approximately a root.\n\nTherefore, the curvature is maximized at x\u2248\u00b11.05, which is the fourth root of (1 +\u221a7)/3.\n\nBut since this is a complicated expression, perhaps the problem expects a numerical answer, but the user hasn't provided options. Wait, the original question says \"response format\" and asks to provide the answer. So maybe the answer is in terms of x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}, which can be written as x=\u00b1sqrt( sqrt( (1+\u221a7)/3 ) ).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to simplify. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute (1+\u221a7)/3 \u22483.6458/3\u22481.2153. Then take the fourth root, which is the square root of the square root. So sqrt(1.2153)\u22481.102, then sqrt(1.102)\u22481.05, which matches the approximate value earlier.\n\nBut I don't think there's a simpler exact form. Therefore, the answer should be x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's an error in my approach. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum curvature occurs where the denominator of \u03ba is minimized, since \u03ba is numerator divided by denominator. So to maximize \u03ba, minimize the denominator. But the denominator is [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). So we need to minimize 1 + (x^4 -1)^2. This expression is minimized when (x^4 -1)^2 is minimized. The minimum of (x^4 -1)^2 occurs when x^4 =1, i.e., x=\u00b11. At x=\u00b11, this term is zero, so denominator becomes 1, which is minimal. Therefore, the denominator is minimized at x=\u00b11, which makes \u03ba=4x\u00b3 /1. So at x=1, \u03ba=4, and at x=-1, \u03ba=4*|\u22121|\u00b3=4. So the curvature is 4 at x=\u00b11. But earlier calculation showed that at x=1.05, the curvature is higher. How can this be?\n\nAh, there's a mistake here. When we minimize the denominator, we maximize \u03ba. But only if the numerator is maximized as well. Wait, but the numerator is 4|x|\u00b3, which increases as |x| increases. So when x increases beyond 1, the numerator increases, but the denominator also increases because (x^4 -1)^2 starts to increase again. So there's a balance between the numerator and denominator.\n\nAt x=1, the denominator is minimized, but the numerator is 4*1=4. For x>1, the numerator 4x\u00b3 increases, but (x^4 -1)^2 increases even faster, leading to the denominator increasing more rapidly. However, for x slightly greater than 1, the numerator's increase might outpace the denominator's increase, leading to a higher \u03ba. This seems to be what happened in the earlier calculation where \u03ba increased beyond x=1 up to a point.\n\nTherefore, the minimal denominator does not necessarily give the maximal \u03ba because the numerator is also changing. So the maximum curvature occurs not at x=1, but at a point where the rate of increase of the numerator and denominator balance each other.\n\nThus, the correct answer based on the critical point analysis is x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. But since this is a complicated expression, perhaps the problem expects a numerical approximation. For example, x\u2248\u00b11.05.\n\nBut let me check if there is any error in my calculations. Let me compute the curvature at x=1 and x\u22481.05.\n\nAt x=1: \u03ba=4.\n\nAt x\u22481.05: \u03ba\u22484.327. So higher.\n\nAt x=1.1: \u03ba\u22483.98.\n\nAt x=1.05, \u03ba is higher than at x=1. So the maximum is indeed at x\u22481.05.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for where the curvature is maximal, and the answer requires a boxed expression, perhaps the exact answer is expected even if it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the setup. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, wait. Let's plug x=1 into the critical point equation:\n\n3x^8 -2x^4 -2=0 \u21923*(1)^8 -2*(1)^4 -2=3-2-2=-1\u22600. So x=1 is not a solution. Therefore, the critical points are indeed at x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. That's the exact solution. However, the problem might expect this answer.\n\nBut maybe there's a simplification. Let me square both sides twice:\n\nLet x^4 = (1+\u221a7)/3 \u2192 x= [ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}\n\nAlternatively, rationalizing, but I don't see a simpler way. Therefore, the answer is x=\u00b1\u221c[(1+\u221a7)/3]\n\nAlternatively, writing with radicals:\n\nx=\u00b1 \\sqrt[4]{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{7}}{3}}\n\nThis is how it should be presented. Therefore, the curvature is maximal at x=\u00b1 the fourth root of (1+\u221a7)/3.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a decimal approximation, but since it's not specified, the exact form is better.\n\nSo, after this long calculation, the answer is x=\u00b1\u221c[(1+\u221a7)/3]\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe curvature is maximal at x = \u00b1\u221c[(1 + \u221a7)/3]. \n\nBut to confirm once more, the critical points were found by setting the derivative of \u03ba to zero, leading to the equation 3x\u2078 - 2x\u2074 - 2 = 0, which was solved by substituting y = x\u2074, resulting in y = (1 + \u221a7)/3. Taking the fourth root gives the x-values where curvature is maximized.\n\nExplanation: The curvature \u03ba of f(x) is given by \u03ba = |4x\u00b3| / [1 + (x\u2074 \u2212 1)\u00b2]^(3/2). To find the maxima, we derived and set the derivative of \u03ba to zero, solving the resulting equation to find critical points at x = \u00b1[(1 + \u221a7)/3]^(1/4).\n</think>\n\nTo find where the curvature of \\( f(x) = \\frac{x^5}{5} - x \\) is maximal, we use the curvature formula for a function \\( y = f(x) \\):\n\\[\n\\kappa = \\frac{|f''(x)|}{\\left[1 + (f'(x))^2\\right]^{3/2}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Compute Derivatives**\n- First derivative: \\( f'(x) = x^4 - 1 \\)\n- Second derivative: \\( f''(x) = 4x^3 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Substitute into Curvature Formula**\n\\[\n\\kappa = \\frac{4|x|^3}{\\left[1 + (x^4 - 1)^2\\right]^{3/2}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Find Critical Points**\nTo maximize \\( \\kappa \\), compute the derivative \\( \\frac{d\\kappa}{dx} \\) and set it to zero.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find where the curvature of the function f(x) = (x^5)/5 - x is maximal. Hmm, curvature... I remember from my calculus class that curvature measures how much the curve is bending at a point. The formula for curvature involves the first and second derivatives of the function. Let me try to recall the exact formula.\n\nRight, the curvature \u03ba (kappa) for a function y = f(x) is given by:\n\n\u03ba = |f''(x)| / [1 + (f'(x))^2]^(3/2)\n\nSo first, I need to find the first and second derivatives of f(x). Let's compute those.\n\nf(x) = (x^5)/5 - x\n\nFirst derivative, f'(x): The derivative of x^5/5 is x^4, and the derivative of -x is -1. So f'(x) = x^4 - 1.\n\nSecond derivative, f''(x): The derivative of x^4 is 4x^3, and the derivative of -1 is 0. So f''(x) = 4x^3.\n\nNow, plug these into the curvature formula:\n\n\u03ba = |4x^3| / [1 + (x^4 - 1)^2]^(3/2)\n\nSince we're dealing with absolute value in the numerator, and x^3's sign depends on x, but when squared, it's all positive. Wait, but here the numerator is |4x^3|, which simplifies to 4|x^3|. But since x^3 is positive when x>0 and negative when x<0, the absolute value makes it 4|x|^3. Maybe that's a better way to write it? Anyway, the point is the numerator is 4|x|\u00b3.\n\nSo the curvature becomes:\n\n\u03ba = 4|x|\u00b3 / [1 + (x^4 - 1)^2]^(3/2)\n\nNow, the question is asking where this curvature is maximal. So I need to find the value(s) of x where \u03ba is maximized. To find the maximum of \u03ba, I should take the derivative of \u03ba with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. But this might get complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the curvature is a function of x, maybe I can analyze its critical points by taking the derivative d\u03ba/dx and solving for when it's zero. But the expression for \u03ba is a bit complex. Let's denote the denominator as D = [1 + (x^4 - 1)^2]^(3/2). Then \u03ba = 4|x|\u00b3 / D. To maximize \u03ba, since the numerator and denominator are both positive (except at x=0, but let's check that), we can consider the function without the absolute value for x \u2260 0 and see where it's maximized.\n\nWait, but maybe considering x \u2265 0 and x < 0 separately would help due to the |x|\u00b3 term. However, since the function f(x) is an odd function? Let's check. f(-x) = (-x)^5/5 - (-x) = -x^5/5 + x = -(x^5/5 -x) + 2x? Wait, no. Let's see: ( (-x)^5 ) /5 = -x^5/5, and -(-x) = x. So f(-x) = -x^5/5 +x, which is not the same as -f(x) because the original f(x) is x^5/5 -x. So f(-x) = -x^5/5 +x = -(x^5/5 -x) + 2x? Hmm maybe not exactly odd. Wait, perhaps it's symmetric in some way? Maybe not. Let me check f(-x) = -x^5/5 +x. Whereas -f(x) = -x^5/5 +x. Wait, that's the same as f(-x). So f(-x) = -f(x). So actually, f is an odd function. Because f(-x) = -f(x). That's good to know because curvature for an odd function might have some symmetry. Let me confirm that.\n\nIf f is odd, then f(-x) = -f(x). Then f'(-x) = derivative of f(-x) = f'(-x)*(-1) = -f'(x). Wait, derivative of f(-x) is f'(-x)*(-1), so f' is even? Because f'(-x) = -f'(x)*(-1) = f'(x). Wait, no, let me redo:\n\nIf f(-x) = -f(x), then taking derivative on both sides:\n\nd/dx [f(-x)] = d/dx [-f(x)]\n\nLeft side: f'(-x)*(-1)\n\nRight side: -f'(x)\n\nThus, -f'(-x) = -f'(x) \u2192 f'(-x) = f'(x). So f\u2019 is even. So f\u2019 is even function. Then f\u2019(x) = x^4 -1, which is even (since x^4 is even and -1 is even). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, the second derivative f''(x) = 4x^3, which is an odd function. Because 4(-x)^3 = -4x^3.\n\nSo curvature formula \u03ba(x) = |f''(x)| / [1 + (f\u2019(x))^2]^3/2 = |4x^3| / [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^3/2.\n\nBut since the denominator is even in x (because (x^4 -1)^2 is same for x and -x), and the numerator is |4x^3| = 4|x|^3, which is even function (since |x|^3 is same for x and -x). Therefore, \u03ba(x) is an even function. So the curvature at x and -x will be the same. Therefore, the maximal curvature points will be symmetric around the y-axis. So if there is a maximum at x = a, there will be another at x = -a. But let's check if that's the case.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum occurs at x=0? Let me check \u03ba(0). At x=0, the numerator is 0, so \u03ba(0) = 0. So curvature is zero there. So the curvature is zero at x=0. Therefore, the maximum curvature is not there.\n\nSo maybe the maximum curvature occurs at some other points. Let's try plugging in some values.\n\nFor example, x=1: f'(1) = 1^4 -1 = 0. f''(1) =4*1^3=4. So \u03ba(1) = |4| / [1 +0]^3/2 = 4/1 =4.\n\nAt x=1, \u03ba=4.\n\nAt x= -1, similarly \u03ba(-1)= |4*(-1)^3| / [1 +0]^3/2= 4/1=4. Same.\n\nNow, what about x=0. Let's see, at x=0.5:\n\nf'(0.5)= (0.5)^4 -1 = 0.0625 -1= -0.9375. So (f')\u00b2 = (0.9375)^2 \u2248 0.8789. Denominator becomes [1 +0.8789]^(3/2)= (1.8789)^(3/2). Let's compute that:\n\n1.8789^(1/2) \u2248 1.3707, so 1.3707^3 \u2248 2.575. So denominator \u22482.575. Numerator is 4*(0.5)^3=4*(0.125)=0.5. So \u03ba\u22480.5 /2.575\u22480.194.\n\nAt x=1, \u03ba=4. At x=0.5, \u03ba\u22480.194. So much smaller.\n\nWhat about x=1.5?\n\nf'(1.5)= (1.5)^4 -1= (5.0625) -1=4.0625. So (f')\u00b2\u224816.5039. Denominator: [1 +16.5039]^(3/2)=17.5039^(3/2). Let's compute sqrt(17.5039)=~4.184. Then 4.184^3 \u2248 73.3. Numerator is 4*(1.5)^3=4*(3.375)=13.5. So \u03ba\u224813.5 /73.3\u22480.184. So even smaller than at x=0.5. So curvature is decreasing as x moves away from 1 in the positive direction beyond 1.\n\nWait, but at x=1, the curvature is 4. At x=0.5, it's about 0.194, which is much lower. So maybe the curvature is maximized at x=1 and x=-1? Because when we plug in x=1, we get \u03ba=4, which is higher than around there.\n\nBut wait, let's check x=0. Let's check x approaching 1 from below, say x=0.9:\n\nf'(0.9)=0.9^4 -1 \u22480.6561 -1= -0.3439. (f')\u00b2\u22480.1182. Denominator: [1 +0.1182]^(3/2)=1.1182^(3/2). Square root is 1.057, then raised to 3: \u22481.057^3\u22481.18. Numerator:4*(0.9)^3\u22484*0.729=2.916. So \u03ba\u22482.916/1.18\u22482.47. Which is less than 4 at x=1.\n\nWait, so at x=1, the curvature is 4, but as x approaches 1 from the left, curvature increases to 4. Let me check x=1. Let's see, at exactly x=1, f'(1)=0, so denominator is [1+0]^(3/2)=1. So numerator is 4*1=4. So \u03ba=4. What about as x approaches 1 from the right? Let's take x=1.1:\n\nf'(1.1)= (1.1)^4 -1\u22481.4641 -1=0.4641. (f')\u00b2\u22480.215. Denominator: [1 +0.215]^(3/2)=1.215^(3/2). Square root is approximately 1.102, then cube is ~1.102^3\u22481.337. Numerator:4*(1.1)^3\u22484*1.331=5.324. So \u03ba\u22485.324/1.337\u22483.98. That's very close to 4, but slightly less. Wait, but maybe this is due to approximation errors. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nWait, if x=1, \u03ba=4. For x slightly larger than 1, like x=1.01:\n\nCompute f'(1.01) = (1.01)^4 -1 \u22481.040604 -1 =0.040604. So (f')\u00b2\u22480.001649. Denominator:1.001649^(3/2). The square root is approximately sqrt(1.001649)=1.000824. Then raising to the 3rd power: (1.000824)^3\u22481.00247. The numerator is 4*(1.01)^3\u22484*(1.030301)=4.1212. So \u03ba\u22484.1212 /1.00247\u22484.11. Which is slightly higher than 4? Wait, that contradicts previous thought.\n\nWait, but maybe my calculation is off. Let me compute (1.01)^4:\n\n1.01^4 = (1 +0.01)^4 \u22481 +4*0.01 +6*(0.01)^2 +4*(0.01)^3 + (0.01)^4\u22481 +0.04 +0.0006 +0.000004 +0.00000001\u22481.040604. So correct. So f'(1.01)=0.040604. Then (f')\u00b2\u22480.040604^2\u22480.001649. So denominator is [1 +0.001649]^(3/2)= (1.001649)^(3/2). Let me compute sqrt(1.001649) first. The square root of 1.001649 is approximately 1.000824 (since (1.000824)^2=1 +2*0.000824 + (0.000824)^2\u22481 +0.001648 +0.000000678\u22481.001648678). So sqrt(1.001649)\u22481.000824. Then raising to the 3/2 power: (1.000824)^3\u22481.00247. So denominator\u22481.00247.\n\nNumerator:4*(1.01)^3=4*(1.030301)=4.121204. So \u03ba\u22484.121204 /1.00247\u22484.111. So that's a bit higher than 4. Wait, so at x=1.01, \u03ba\u22484.11, which is higher than at x=1. So that suggests that the curvature might have a maximum slightly above x=1? But wait, at x=1, the denominator is 1, and numerator is 4*1=4, so \u03ba=4. But at x=1.01, \u03ba is higher. That's interesting. So maybe the maximum is not exactly at x=1. Let's check this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum curvature is achieved at x=1. But when I compute x=1.01, the curvature increases. So perhaps the maximum is not at x=1.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Perhaps I need to take the derivative of \u03ba with respect to x and find where it's zero.\n\nSo let's set up the function \u03ba(x) = 4|x|\u00b3 / [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). For x > 0, we can drop the absolute value: \u03ba(x) =4x\u00b3 / [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Let's consider x >0 and compute the derivative d\u03ba/dx.\n\nLet me denote N =4x\u00b3, D = [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Then \u03ba = N/D. The derivative is (N' D - N D') / D\u00b2.\n\nFirst compute N' = 12x\u00b2.\n\nCompute D = [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Let me let u =1 + (x^4 -1)^2. Then D= u^(3/2). So D' = (3/2)u^(1/2) * d/dx [u].\n\nCompute d/dx [u] = d/dx [1 + (x^4 -1)^2] = 2(x^4 -1)(4x\u00b3) =8x\u00b3(x^4 -1).\n\nTherefore, D' = (3/2)u^(1/2)*8x\u00b3(x^4 -1) =12x\u00b3(x^4 -1)*u^(1/2).\n\nNow, putting it into the derivative:\n\nd\u03ba/dx = [12x\u00b2 * D - N* D'] / D\u00b2\n\n= [12x\u00b2 * u^(3/2) -4x\u00b3 *12x\u00b3(x^4 -1) u^(1/2)] / u^3\n\nFactor out terms:\n\n= [12x\u00b2 u^(3/2) -48x^6 (x^4 -1) u^(1/2)] / u^3\n\nFactor 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) from numerator:\n\n=12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) [u -4x^4(x^4 -1)] / u^3\n\nSimplify:\n\n=12x\u00b2 [u -4x^4(x^4 -1)] / u^(3/2)\n\nBut u=1 + (x^4 -1)^2. Let's expand that:\n\n(x^4 -1)^2 =x^8 -2x^4 +1. So u=1 +x^8 -2x^4 +1= x^8 -2x^4 +2.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n=12x\u00b2 [x^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^4(x^4 -1)] / [x^8 -2x^4 +2]^(3/2)\n\nSimplify the numerator in the brackets:\n\nx^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^4(x^4 -1) =x^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^8 +4x^4 = (x^8 -4x^8) + (-2x^4 +4x^4) +2 = (-3x^8) +2x^4 +2.\n\nSo the derivative d\u03ba/dx becomes:\n\n12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) / [x^8 -2x^4 +2]^(3/2)\n\nSet this equal to zero to find critical points. The denominator is always positive, so the critical points occur when the numerator is zero:\n\n12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) =0\n\nSet 12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) =0 \u2192 Either x=0 (but we are considering x>0), or -3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0.\n\nSo solve -3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0. Let's make substitution y =x^4. Then equation becomes:\n\n-3y\u00b2 +2y +2=0 \u2192 multiply both sides by -1:3y\u00b2 -2y -2=0.\n\nSolve quadratic equation: y = [2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +24)]/(6) = [2 \u00b1\u221a28]/6 = [2 \u00b12\u221a7]/6 = [1 \u00b1\u221a7]/3.\n\nSince y=x^4 \u22650, we check which roots are positive:\n\n[1 +\u221a7]/3 \u2248 (1 +2.6458)/3\u22483.6458/3\u22481.215 (positive)\n\n[1 -\u221a7]/3\u2248(1-2.6458)/3\u2248(-1.6458)/3\u2248-0.5486 (negative). Discard negative root.\n\nThus, y=[1 +\u221a7]/3 \u2192x^4= [1 +\u221a7]/3 \u2192x= ([1 +\u221a7]/3 )^(1/4). Let's compute approximate value:\n\nFirst, compute [1 +\u221a7]\u22481 +2.6458\u22483.6458. Divide by 3:\u22481.2153. Then take the 4th root. Since 1.2153 is approximately 1.2153^0.25. Let me compute:\n\nLet me note that 1.2^4= (1.2)^2*(1.2)^2=1.44*1.44=2.0736. Which is more than 1.2153. Wait, but we need a number x such that x^4=1.2153. Let's see:\n\n(1.05)^4 = approx (1.05)^2=1.1025, squared again:1.1025^2\u22481.2155. So, (1.05)^4\u22481.2155, which is very close to 1.2153. So approximately x\u22481.05. So x\u2248( [1 +\u221a7]/3 )^(1/4)\u22481.05. So critical point at x\u22481.05.\n\nTherefore, the derivative is zero at x\u22481.05. So this is where the curvature might be maximum for x>0. Similarly, due to symmetry, the same applies at x\u2248-1.05.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed at x=1.01, the curvature was around 4.11, which is higher than at x=1. So perhaps the maximum is around x\u22481.05.\n\nBut wait, the question asks where the curvature is maximal. So according to this analysis, there are critical points at x\u2248\u00b11.05. But maybe that's the case.\n\nBut to confirm, let's compute the curvature at x=1.05. Let's approximate.\n\nFirst, compute x=1.05:\n\nCompute f'(1.05)=x^4 -1= (1.05)^4 -1\u22481.2155 -1=0.2155. So (f')\u00b2\u22480.0464. Denominator:1 +0.0464=1.0464. Raise to 3/2 power: (1.0464)^(3/2). sqrt(1.0464)=\u22481.0229, then cube:\u22481.0229^3\u22481.070. So denominator\u22481.070. Numerator=4*(1.05)^3\u22484*1.1576\u22484.6304. So \u03ba\u22484.6304 /1.070\u22484.327.\n\nAt x=1.05, \u03ba\u22484.327. Which is higher than at x=1.01. Then, perhaps the maximum is around x=1.05. Similarly, for x=1.1, we saw \u03ba\u22483.98, which is lower. So maybe the curvature peaks around x\u22481.05.\n\nBut solving for x exactly would require solving that quartic equation, which is complicated. However, the problem is asking where the curvature is maximal, and the answer options might expect a simpler answer. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go back to the derivative calculation. When I set up the equation for critical points, I had:\n\n-3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0 \u2192 Let's check the coefficients again.\n\nThe numerator after simplifying was -3x^8 +2x^4 +2. So the equation is -3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0 \u2192 3x^8 -2x^4 -2=0. Then substitution y=x^4 gives 3y\u00b2 -2y -2=0, which has roots y=(2\u00b1\u221a(4 +24))/6=(2\u00b1\u221a28)/6=(2\u00b12\u221a7)/6=(1\u00b1\u221a7)/3. As before, y positive is (1+\u221a7)/3\u22481.215. So x= ( (1+\u221a7)/3 )^(1/4).\n\nBut perhaps this can be expressed as exact form. Let me compute:\n\nLet me compute 1+\u221a7\u22483.6458. Divided by3\u22481.2153. Then taking the 4th root. But I don't know a simpler form for that. So the exact point where curvature is maximized is x=\u00b1 [ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^(1/4). But maybe the question expects an approximate answer? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum curvature occurs at x=1 and x=-1. But according to the derivative, the critical points are at x\u2248\u00b11.05. However, when I computed at x=1, the curvature was 4, but at x=1.05, it's higher. So perhaps the answer is not at x=\u00b11. But the problem is asking where the curvature is maximal, so according to this, it's at those critical points. But since the problem might expect a simpler answer, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the derivative calculation again.\n\nWe started with \u03ba =4x\u00b3 / D, where D= [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Then the derivative d\u03ba/dx = [12x\u00b2 D -4x\u00b3 D'] / D\u00b2.\n\nThen D' is derivative of D: let's recompute that.\n\nLet me write D = [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). Let u =1 + (x^4 -1)^2. So D = u^(3/2). Then dD/dx = (3/2)u^(1/2) * derivative of u.\n\nDerivative of u is derivative of (x^4 -1)^2: 2(x^4 -1)(4x^3) =8x^3(x^4 -1). So D'= (3/2)*u^(1/2)*8x^3(x^4 -1) =12x^3(x^4 -1)u^(1/2).\n\nSo substituting into the derivative:\n\nd\u03ba/dx = [12x\u00b2 * u^(3/2) -4x\u00b3 *12x^3(x^4 -1) u^(1/2)] / u^3\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) [u -4x^6 (x^4 -1)] / u^3\n\nWait, here's a mistake. Because in the second term, 4x\u00b3 *12x^3(x^4 -1) u^(1/2) is 48x^6(x^4 -1)u^(1/2). But in the denominator, it's D\u00b2 = u^3. So numerator is 12x\u00b2 u^(3/2) -48x^6(x^4 -1)u^(1/2). Then factor out 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2):\n\n=12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) [u -4x^4(x^4 -1)] / u^3\n\nWait, wait: 12x\u00b2 u^(3/2) is 12x\u00b2 * u^(3/2), and the second term is 48x^6(x^4 -1)u^(1/2). So when factoring 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2), the first term becomes 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) * u, and the second term is 12x\u00b2 u^(1/2) * (-4x^4(x^4 -1)). Therefore, the term inside the brackets is [u -4x^4(x^4 -1)].\n\nBut u =1 + (x^4 -1)^2 =1 +x^8 -2x^4 +1 =x^8 -2x^4 +2.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n[u -4x^4(x^4 -1)] = x^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^4(x^4 -1) =x^8 -2x^4 +2 -4x^8 +4x^4 = (-3x^8) +2x^4 +2. That's correct.\n\nThus, the numerator is 12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) and denominator is u^{3/2} = [x^8 -2x^4 +2]^{3/2}\n\nSo setting numerator equal to zero:\n\n12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2)=0. For x>0, x\u22600, so solve -3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0 \u2192 3x^8 -2x^4 -2=0\n\nSubstitution y=x^4 gives 3y\u00b2 -2y -2=0. Solution:\n\ny = [2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +24)]/6 = [2 \u00b1\u221a28]/6 = [2 \u00b12\u221a7]/6 = [1 \u00b1\u221a7]/3. Only positive solution is y=(1 +\u221a7)/3.\n\nThus, x= [ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}\n\nCalculating numerically:\n\n1 +\u221a7 \u22481 +2.6458\u22483.6458. Divided by3\u22481.2153. Then 1.2153^{1/4}:\n\n1.2153^(1/4) can be approximated as follows: since 1.2^4=2.0736, which is larger than 1.2153. So maybe take log:\n\nln(1.2153)\u22480.196. Then (1/4)*0.196\u22480.049. So e^{0.049}\u22481.05. So x\u22481.05.\n\nThus, the critical points are at x\u2248\u00b11.05. Therefore, the curvature is maximal at x\u2248\u00b11.05.\n\nBut the problem asks \"Where is the curvature maximal?\" So it's expecting an answer in terms of x. If they accept exact form, it's x=\u00b1[ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. But this is quite complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, or maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, but maybe we can check second derivative test at x=1. Let's see. If x=1 is a critical point, but according to the earlier derivative calculation, when x=1, the numerator of d\u03ba/dx is:\n\n12x\u00b2 (-3x^8 +2x^4 +2) at x=1:\n\n12*1^2*(-3*1^8 +2*1^4 +2)=12*(-3 +2 +2)=12*(1)=12>0. So at x=1, the derivative is positive, meaning that \u03ba is increasing at x=1. Thus, if the derivative is positive at x=1, then the maximum must be at a point where x>1. Wait, but earlier when I computed x=1.01, the curvature was increasing. But according to the critical point calculation, the maximum is at x\u22481.05.\n\nWait, but when I plug in x=1 into the derivative, the numerator is 12x\u00b2(-3x^8 +2x^4 +2). At x=1, that gives 12*1*(-3 +2 +2)=12*(1)=12. Which is positive. So at x=1, the derivative of \u03ba is positive, meaning that as x increases past 1, \u03ba is increasing. So the curvature is increasing at x=1, which suggests that the maximum is not at x=1, but somewhere after. So the critical point at x\u22481.05 is the maximum.\n\nBut this seems to contradict my earlier thought that at x=1, curvature is 4, and around x=1.01, it's higher. So that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, according to this analysis, the curvature is maximal at x\u2248\u00b11.05. But how can we express this exact value?\n\nThe exact value is x=\u00b1[ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. Let's see if this can be simplified.\n\n(1 +\u221a7)/3 = (1 +\u221a7)/3. So x= [ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. Alternatively, maybe rationalizing or other steps, but I think that's as simple as it gets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an answer of x=\u00b11, but according to the calculations, that's not the case. But maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if the curvature has its maximum at x=1. Let's compute the second derivative at the critical point x\u22481.05 to confirm if it's a maximum.\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Alternatively, since the curvature increases beyond x=1 up to x\u22481.05 and then decreases, that critical point must be the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the curvature is maximal at x=\u00b1 [ (1 +\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach or a simplification.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the derivative calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I computed the derivative, the critical points are where d\u03ba/dx=0. But in the numerator, after substituting, we have:\n\n-3x^8 +2x^4 +2=0. So the equation is 3x^8 -2x^4 -2=0. Let me check with x=1.05:\n\nCompute 3*(1.05)^8 -2*(1.05)^4 -2.\n\nFirst, (1.05)^4\u22481.2155. Then (1.05)^8\u2248(1.2155)^2\u22481.4775.\n\nSo 3*1.4775\u22484.4325. Then 2*(1.2155)\u22482.431. So 4.4325 -2.431 -2\u22484.4325 -4.431\u22480.0015. Close to zero. Thus, x=1.05 is approximately a root.\n\nTherefore, the curvature is maximized at x\u2248\u00b11.05, which is the fourth root of (1 +\u221a7)/3.\n\nBut since this is a complicated expression, perhaps the problem expects a numerical answer, but the user hasn't provided options. Wait, the original question says \"response format\" and asks to provide the answer. So maybe the answer is in terms of x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}, which can be written as x=\u00b1sqrt( sqrt( (1+\u221a7)/3 ) ).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to simplify. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute (1+\u221a7)/3 \u22483.6458/3\u22481.2153. Then take the fourth root, which is the square root of the square root. So sqrt(1.2153)\u22481.102, then sqrt(1.102)\u22481.05, which matches the approximate value earlier.\n\nBut I don't think there's a simpler exact form. Therefore, the answer should be x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's an error in my approach. Let me think if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum curvature occurs where the denominator of \u03ba is minimized, since \u03ba is numerator divided by denominator. So to maximize \u03ba, minimize the denominator. But the denominator is [1 + (x^4 -1)^2]^(3/2). So we need to minimize 1 + (x^4 -1)^2. This expression is minimized when (x^4 -1)^2 is minimized. The minimum of (x^4 -1)^2 occurs when x^4 =1, i.e., x=\u00b11. At x=\u00b11, this term is zero, so denominator becomes 1, which is minimal. Therefore, the denominator is minimized at x=\u00b11, which makes \u03ba=4x\u00b3 /1. So at x=1, \u03ba=4, and at x=-1, \u03ba=4*|\u22121|\u00b3=4. So the curvature is 4 at x=\u00b11. But earlier calculation showed that at x=1.05, the curvature is higher. How can this be?\n\nAh, there's a mistake here. When we minimize the denominator, we maximize \u03ba. But only if the numerator is maximized as well. Wait, but the numerator is 4|x|\u00b3, which increases as |x| increases. So when x increases beyond 1, the numerator increases, but the denominator also increases because (x^4 -1)^2 starts to increase again. So there's a balance between the numerator and denominator.\n\nAt x=1, the denominator is minimized, but the numerator is 4*1=4. For x>1, the numerator 4x\u00b3 increases, but (x^4 -1)^2 increases even faster, leading to the denominator increasing more rapidly. However, for x slightly greater than 1, the numerator's increase might outpace the denominator's increase, leading to a higher \u03ba. This seems to be what happened in the earlier calculation where \u03ba increased beyond x=1 up to a point.\n\nTherefore, the minimal denominator does not necessarily give the maximal \u03ba because the numerator is also changing. So the maximum curvature occurs not at x=1, but at a point where the rate of increase of the numerator and denominator balance each other.\n\nThus, the correct answer based on the critical point analysis is x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. But since this is a complicated expression, perhaps the problem expects a numerical approximation. For example, x\u2248\u00b11.05.\n\nBut let me check if there is any error in my calculations. Let me compute the curvature at x=1 and x\u22481.05.\n\nAt x=1: \u03ba=4.\n\nAt x\u22481.05: \u03ba\u22484.327. So higher.\n\nAt x=1.1: \u03ba\u22483.98.\n\nAt x=1.05, \u03ba is higher than at x=1. So the maximum is indeed at x\u22481.05.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for where the curvature is maximal, and the answer requires a boxed expression, perhaps the exact answer is expected even if it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the setup. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, wait. Let's plug x=1 into the critical point equation:\n\n3x^8 -2x^4 -2=0 \u21923*(1)^8 -2*(1)^4 -2=3-2-2=-1\u22600. So x=1 is not a solution. Therefore, the critical points are indeed at x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is x=\u00b1[ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}. That's the exact solution. However, the problem might expect this answer.\n\nBut maybe there's a simplification. Let me square both sides twice:\n\nLet x^4 = (1+\u221a7)/3 \u2192 x= [ (1+\u221a7)/3 ]^{1/4}\n\nAlternatively, rationalizing, but I don't see a simpler way. Therefore, the answer is x=\u00b1\u221c[(1+\u221a7)/3]\n\nAlternatively, writing with radicals:\n\nx=\u00b1 \\sqrt[4]{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{7}}{3}}\n\nThis is how it should be presented. Therefore, the curvature is maximal at x=\u00b1 the fourth root of (1+\u221a7)/3.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a decimal approximation, but since it's not specified, the exact form is better.\n\nSo, after this long calculation, the answer is x=\u00b1\u221c[(1+\u221a7)/3]\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe curvature is maximal at x = \u00b1\u221c[(1 + \u221a7)/3]. \n\nBut to confirm once more, the critical points were found by setting the derivative of \u03ba to zero, leading to the equation 3x\u2078 - 2x\u2074 - 2 = 0, which was solved by substituting y = x\u2074, resulting in y = (1 + \u221a7)/3. Taking the fourth root gives the x-values where curvature is maximized.\n\nExplanation: The curvature \u03ba of f(x) is given by \u03ba = |4x\u00b3| / [1 + (x\u2074 \u2212 1)\u00b2]^(3/2). To find the maxima, we derived and set the derivative of \u03ba to zero, solving the resulting equation to find critical points at x = \u00b1[(1 + \u221a7)/3]^(1/4).",
