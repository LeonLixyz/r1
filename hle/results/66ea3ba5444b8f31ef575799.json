  "question": "Random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ satisfy\n$I(X;Y)=3$,\n$I(X;Y|Z)=2$,\n$I(X;Z|Y)=5$.\nThe random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. What is the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem gives some mutual information values and asks for the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) where W is a deterministic function of Z. Hmm. Alright, let me try to recall some information theory concepts.\n\nFirst, mutual information I(X;Y) measures the amount of information that X and Y share. The conditional mutual information I(X;Y|Z) is the mutual information given Z. Also, since W is a deterministic function of Z, that means W is a function that depends only on Z, so knowing Z gives you W, but knowing W might not give you all the information about Z. So, W is a coarser version of Z.\n\nI remember that processing data, like applying a function, can't increase mutual information. So, if W is a function of Z, then I(X;Y|W) might be related to I(X;Y|Z). But how?\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible I(X;Y|W). Let's think about the given data:\n\nI(X;Y) = 3. That's the mutual information between X and Y without any conditioning.\n\nI(X;Y|Z) = 2. So, when you condition on Z, the mutual information between X and Y drops to 2. That suggests that Z might explain some of the mutual information between X and Y.\n\nThen there's I(X;Z|Y) = 5. That's the mutual information between X and Z given Y. Hmm.\n\nThe problem is to find the largest possible I(X;Y|W), where W is a deterministic function of Z. So, depending on how we choose W (i.e., how we process Z into W), we can affect the value of I(X;Y|W).\n\nWe need to maximize this conditional mutual information. Since W is a function of Z, maybe we can use the data processing inequality here. But I need to think about how the conditioning works here.\n\nWait, let's recall the chain rule for mutual information. The chain rule states that:\n\nI(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n\nBut I don't know if that's directly helpful here. Alternatively, maybe we can use the identity that relates mutual information and conditional mutual information. Let me think.\n\nAnother thought: The problem gives us some values. Let's see if there's a way to relate them. Let me write down what's given:\n\nI(X;Y) = 3\n\nI(X;Y|Z) = 2\n\nI(X;Z|Y) = 5\n\nWe need to find max I(X;Y|W) where W is a deterministic function of Z.\n\nSince W is a function of Z, then H(W) \u2264 H(Z), and since it's deterministic, H(W|Z) = 0. Also, data processing inequality might say that I(X;Y|W) \u2265 I(X;Y|Z) because W is a function of Z. Wait, no, the data processing inequality usually applies to mutual information, not conditional. Let me check.\n\nWait, data processing inequality says that if X \u2192 Z \u2192 W is a Markov chain, then I(X;Y) \u2265 I(X;W). But here we have conditioning. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since W is a function of Z, conditioning on W can only reduce the uncertainty compared to conditioning on Z. But wait, because if W is a function of Z, then knowing Z gives you W, but knowing W gives you partial information about Z. So, in terms of conditional mutual information, maybe I(X;Y|W) can be larger or smaller than I(X;Y|Z)?\n\nWait, let's think. If we have more information (i.e., conditioning on Z), then the mutual information between X and Y given Z is 2. If we condition on a coarser variable W, then perhaps the mutual information could be higher. For example, if W loses some information in Z that was making X and Y less dependent when conditioned on Z. So, by removing some conditioning, maybe the mutual information increases.\n\nSo, maybe I(X;Y|W) is greater than or equal to I(X;Y|Z). Because when you condition on less, the mutual information can increase. Wait, mutual information without conditioning is I(X;Y) which is 3. Then, when conditioned on Z, it went down to 2. If we condition on a coarser W, perhaps it goes back up. So the maximum possible would be when we condition on nothing, which is 3, but since W is a function of Z, maybe we can't get back to the original value. Wait, but maybe the maximum possible is 3? But that might not be possible. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible is 3, but maybe there's a constraint based on the given values.\n\nWait, the problem gives I(X;Y|Z) = 2 and I(X;Y) = 3. Then, the interaction between Z and X,Y is such that Z explains some of their mutual information. If W is a function of Z, then depending on how much of Z is captured in W, perhaps we can recover some of that mutual information.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the identity that relates the mutual information and the conditional mutual information. Let me recall that:\n\nI(X;Y) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Y;Z), where the triple mutual information I(X;Y;Z) is the mutual information shared by all three variables. But triple mutual information can be positive or negative. Wait, no, actually the chain rule is:\n\nI(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z). But perhaps another identity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the identity for the difference between I(X;Y) and I(X;Y|Z). Let's see:\n\nI(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Y;Z), which is the multivariate mutual information. But depending on the sign, this could represent how much Z explains the mutual information between X and Y.\n\nIn our case, I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1. So this would be the mutual information that Z contributes to X and Y. If that's the case, then if we remove some of the information in Z (by using W, a function of Z), perhaps we can reduce the amount by which Z explains the mutual information between X and Y, thereby increasing the conditional mutual information I(X;Y|W).\n\nWait, let's formalize this. Suppose that when we condition on Z, the mutual information is 2. If we condition on W, which is a coarsening of Z, then the mutual information I(X;Y|W) would be higher than 2, but how much higher?\n\nIf we can make W carry as little information as possible about the part of Z that was explaining the mutual information between X and Y, then I(X;Y|W) would approach I(X;Y) = 3. But since W is a function of Z, maybe we can't remove all the information in Z that is responsible for the decrease from 3 to 2.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible I(X;Y|W) would be 3, but we need to check if this is achievable. However, since W is a function of Z, perhaps there is a constraint here.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's consider that W is a function of Z, so the data processing inequality tells us that I(X;Y|W) \u2265 I(X;Y|Z). Because since W is a function of Z, conditioning on W is less informative than conditioning on Z. Therefore, removing some conditioning (from Z to W) could make the conditional mutual information larger. For example, if conditioning on Z decreases the mutual information, then conditioning on a coarser W might not decrease it as much. Therefore, the maximum possible I(X;Y|W) is 3, but we need to check if that's achievable.\n\nWait, but if W is a constant function (i.e., W is independent of Z), then W provides no information, so I(X;Y|W) would be I(X;Y) = 3. However, in this problem, W is a deterministic function of Z. If W is a constant function, then it is a deterministic function (since it doesn't depend on Z, but the problem states that W is a deterministic function of Z. Wait, even a constant function is a deterministic function of Z. So, can we set W to be a constant? If so, then I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) = 3.\n\nBut then, the problem states that W is a deterministic function of Z, but doesn't say that W has to be non-trivial. So, in that case, setting W to be a constant (ignoring Z) would make I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) = 3, which would be the maximum possible, since mutual information can't exceed that. But is this possible? Let me check.\n\nWait, if W is a constant function, then it's independent of Z. But in the problem, W is a deterministic function of Z. However, even a constant function is technically a deterministic function. So, yes, W could be a constant. However, in that case, W is independent of Z, but since W is a function of Z, the only way that can happen is if W is constant. So, that's allowed. Therefore, the maximum possible I(X;Y|W) is 3.\n\nBut wait, but the problem gives other information: I(X;Z|Y) = 5. Does that affect the result? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps there are constraints from the other mutual information values. Let's try to model the relationships between X, Y, Z.\n\nUsing the chain rule for mutual information:\n\nI(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n\nAlso, I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\n\nSo, equating the two:\n\nI(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\n\nPlugging in the given numbers:\n\nI(X;Z) + 2 = 3 + 5\n\nSo I(X;Z) = 3 + 5 - 2 = 6.\n\nTherefore, I(X;Z) = 6.\n\nSo we have that X and Z share 6 bits of information. Then, given Y, there's I(X;Z|Y) =5, which means that even after knowing Y, there's still 5 bits of mutual information between X and Z.\n\nBut how does this affect the original question?\n\nWe need to find the maximum of I(X;Y|W) where W is a function of Z. Let's consider that W is a function of Z. Then, perhaps we can write:\n\nI(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y;W), where I(X;Y;W) is the multivariate mutual information. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to decompose.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the identity:\n\nI(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y;W)\n\nBut multivariate mutual information can be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using the chain rule:\n\nI(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)\n\nBut also, since W is a function of Z, and Z is related to X and Y, perhaps we need to find relationships between these terms.\n\nAlternatively, note that since W is a function of Z, we have that X \u2192 Z \u2192 W forms a Markov chain, given Y. Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps conditioning on Y, X and W are not necessarily independent. Hmm. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's think of W as a processed version of Z. Since W is a deterministic function of Z, we have H(W|Z) = 0. Therefore, the mutual information I(X;Y|W) can be written as H(X|W) - H(X|Y,W). But I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that conditioning reduces entropy. But mutual information is difference of entropies.\n\nAlternatively, note that for any W which is a function of Z, the data processing inequality gives that I(X;W) \u2264 I(X;Z). Similarly, but how does that relate to I(X;Y|W)?\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think of the problem in terms of the following: when W is a function of Z, then conditioning on W is coarser than conditioning on Z. Therefore, the conditional mutual information I(X;Y|W) can be seen as an average over the possible values of W of the mutual information between X and Y given each specific W=w. Since each W=w corresponds to some subset of Z values, the mutual information for each subset could be higher or lower than when conditioning on Z. However, when we average them over W, the total might be higher.\n\nBut how can we maximize this? The maximum would occur when the function W is chosen such that, within each partition induced by W, the mutual information I(X;Y|W=w) is as large as possible.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum possible is when W is a minimal sufficient statistic for Z regarding the mutual information between X and Y. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since I(X;Y|Z) = 2, and W is a function of Z, then perhaps I(X;Y|W) \u2265 I(X;Y|Z). But why?\n\nWait, consider that since W is a function of Z, conditioning on W is less information than conditioning on Z. Therefore, when we condition on W, there might be some residual information about Z not captured by W, which could affect the mutual information between X and Y. However, mutual information can go up or down depending on what's captured by W.\n\nBut is there a general inequality that says I(X;Y|W) \u2265 I(X;Y|Z) when W is a function of Z? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, consider that conditioning on more variables can either increase or decrease mutual information. For example, if Z is a common cause of X and Y, then conditioning on Z might reduce the mutual information between X and Y. Alternatively, if Z is a collider, conditioning on Z might create a dependence.\n\nBut in our case, since W is a function of Z, perhaps the situation is similar to the data processing theorem but for conditional mutual information. For instance, since W is a function of Z, perhaps the information that W can give about X and Y is limited by Z. But I need to think through an example.\n\nSuppose that Z is a variable that, when known, reduces the mutual information between X and Y from 3 to 2. If we create a function W of Z that loses some information, then when we condition on W, maybe the mutual information between X and Y increases again.\n\nIn the extreme case where W is a constant (so no information), then conditioning on W is like not conditioning at all, so I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) = 3.\n\nBut is that possible? If W is a constant function of Z, then yes. So then, the maximum possible I(X;Y|W) is 3. But does that violate any of the other given constraints?\n\nWait, but let's check with the given mutual information values. If we set W to be a constant, then I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) =3, which is higher than the given I(X;Y|Z) =2. So is that possible?\n\nBut in this case, Z is another variable. Let me see. If we condition on a constant (i.e., don't condition on anything), then yeah, the mutual information is 3. But if W is a constant, then H(W) =0, and I(X;Y|W) would just be I(X;Y), which is 3. So that's possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that W is a deterministic function of Z. So even a constant function is allowed. Therefore, the answer could be 3, which is higher than 2, which is the value when conditioning on Z. But then, how does the I(X;Z|Y)=5 factor into this?\n\nWait, maybe there's some constraint here. Let me check.\n\nWe have:\n\nI(X;Z) =6, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlso, I(X;Z|Y)=5. So the mutual information between X and Z given Y is 5. So even after knowing Y, X and Z share 5 bits of information.\n\nBut how does this relate to W being a function of Z? If we set W to be a constant, then X and W would have zero mutual information, since W is constant. But since I(X;Z) =6, and W is a function of Z, if W is a constant, then I(X;W)=0. But W being a function of Z, that's allowed.\n\nBut then, the other mutual information terms don't directly affect I(X;Y|W) in this scenario. Because when W is a constant, I(X;Y|W)=I(X;Y)=3, which is possible.\n\nBut maybe there's an error here. Let me consider if setting W to be constant is possible. For instance, suppose that Z is some variable that's informative about both X and Y, but if we set W to be a constant, we're ignoring Z entirely. Then, the mutual information between X and Y would indeed be 3. But according to the problem statement, Z could be such that conditioning on it reduces the mutual information between X and Y. So, when we ignore Z by using a constant W, the mutual information goes back to 3, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is 3, achieved by taking W as a constant function of Z.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives I(X;Z|Y)=5. Let me check if there's any inconsistency here.\n\nWe know that I(X;Z|Y)=5, which is part of the chain rule decomposition. Also, we have I(X;Z)=6, as derived earlier. So, the mutual information between X and Z is 6, and given Y, it's 5, which makes sense if Y explains some of the mutual information between X and Z.\n\nBut how does that affect W? If W is a constant, then regardless of Z, W is fixed, so the mutual information between X and Y when conditioning on W (which is constant) is just I(X;Y) =3.\n\nBut let me verify this with an example. Suppose X and Y are two variables with I(X;Y)=3. Then, there exists a variable Z such that conditioning on Z reduces their mutual information to 2, and the mutual information between X and Z given Y is 5. Then, if we ignore Z (i.e., set W to a constant), the mutual information between X and Y is again 3. This seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3, with confidence high, but let's check again.\n\nWait, but the problem states that W is a deterministic function of Z. So, even though W is a function, if it's a constant function, then it's allowed. So, in that case, yes, I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) =3. Hence, the maximum possible value is 3.\n\nBut I need to verify if there's any reason that this can't be achieved given the other mutual information values.\n\nSince the problem gives I(X;Z|Y)=5, and I(X;Z)=6. Let's check if these are consistent with W being a constant. If W is a constant, then I(X;W)=0. But since W is a function of Z, the data processing inequality says I(X;W) \u2264 I(X;Z)=6. Which holds, since 0 \u22646. So no problem there.\n\nTherefore, there's no inconsistency. Hence, the maximum possible I(X;Y|W) is 3.\n",
