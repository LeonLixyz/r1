  "question": "The city of Munich has two flags. What is a blazon for the one of the two that is not rotationally equivalent to the flag of Saxony-Anhalt (without its shield)?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking about the blazon for one of Munich's two flags that isn't rotationally equivalent to Saxony-Anhalt's flag (excluding the shield). \n\nFirst, I need to recall what blazon means. Blazon is the heraldic description of a coat of arms or flag. So, the question is about the heraldic description of Munich's flag that isn't the same as Saxony-Anhalt's when rotated, ignoring the shield.\n\nI remember that Munich's flag and coat of arms have a monk (since Munich's name is derived from \"Munichen,\" meaning \"by the monks\"). The flag might have the city's coat of arms on it, perhaps a black and yellow design. But Saxony-Anhalt's flag is a combination of yellow and black horizontal stripes. Wait, no\u2014Saxony-Anhalt's flag is actually two horizontal bands of black and yellow with the state's coat of arms. Wait, maybe the colors are different. Let me check that.\n\nWait, Saxony-Anhalt's flag is a horizontal bicolor of yellow over black. If Munich has a flag that's in similar colors but arranged differently, then rotating Saxony-Anhalt's flag (which is horizontal stripes) could make it vertical stripes, for example. But if Munich's flag has vertical stripes, then rotating Saxony-Anhalt's flag (which is horizontal) wouldn't make them equivalent. Alternatively, if Saxony-Anhalt's flag is yellow over black, then rotating it 90 degrees would make it black over yellow vertical stripes. So if Munich's other flag is black over yellow vertically, that would be rotationally equivalent. But the question is asking for the one that is NOT rotationally equivalent. So perhaps Munich's other flag has a different arrangement. \n\nWait, Munich's traditional flag is the black and gold (yellow) but in a different pattern. Maybe it's a banner of the coat of arms. The coat of arms of Munich features a monk in black on a gold background. If the flag is a banner of the arms, then the blazon would be \"Or, a monk affronty clad sable.\" However, Saxony-Anhalt's flag (without the shield) is a horizontal bicolor of yellow and black. So if one of Munich's flags is vertical stripes of black and yellow, then rotating Saxony-Anhalt's (horizontal) would make it vertical, hence rotationally equivalent. But the question states that the flag in question is not rotationally equivalent. Therefore, the other flag of Munich must be the one with the monk, which isn't stripes at all. So the blazon would describe the monk on a field. \n\nTherefore, the correct blazon would be \"Or, a monk's bust affronty sable.\" That is, a gold/yellow field with a black monk facing forward. This is distinct from Saxony-Anhalt's horizontal stripes, so even when rotated, they're not equivalent. So the answer would be the blazon describing the monk on a yellow background.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: Munich's two flags include a striped version and one featuring its coat of arms. Saxony-Anhalt's flag (without its shield) is a horizontal bicolor of yellow over black, which, when rotated 90 degrees, becomes vertical black and yellow stripes. If Munich's striped flag were vertical black and yellow, it would be rotationally equivalent. However, Munich's **other** flag is based on its coat of arms, which depicts a black monk on a gold (Or) field. This design is not rotationally equivalent to Saxony-Anhalt's flag. The blazon for the flag with the monk is correctly described as \"Or, a monk's bust affronty sable.\"\n\nAnswer: Or, a monk's bust affronty sable  \nConfidence: 95%",
