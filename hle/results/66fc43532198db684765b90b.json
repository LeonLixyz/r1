  "question": "I want to know the exact formula for calculating the sensitivity of metamaterial devices in the THz band to detect the coronavirus by CST.",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to find the exact formula for calculating the sensitivity of metamaterial devices in the THz band used to detect coronavirus using CST software. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that metamaterials are used in sensors because their resonant frequency shifts when the surrounding environment changes, like when a virus binds to the surface. Sensitivity in this context probably relates to how much the resonant frequency shifts per unit change in the material's properties, such as refractive index.\n\nIn some papers I've read, sensitivity (S) is often calculated as the shift in resonant frequency (\u0394f) divided by the change in refractive index (\u0394n). So maybe the formula is S = \u0394f / \u0394n. The units would be GHz/RIU or similar, where RIU is refractive index unit.\n\nBut wait, how does this apply specifically to coronavirus detection using CST? CST is a simulation tool, so the formula would be based on simulated parameters. When designing the metamaterial sensor in CST, you'd simulate the resonant frequency with and without the presence of the coronavirus. The virus's presence would cause a change in the effective refractive index near the metamaterial surface.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes sensitivity is also expressed in terms of wavelength shift instead of frequency. But since the user specified THz band and using CST, which can simulate both frequency and field responses, frequency shift might be more direct.\n\nI should check if there's a different approach. Maybe the figure of merit (FOM) is considered, which combines sensitivity and quality factor. But the question specifically asks for sensitivity, not FOM. So sticking with S = \u0394f / \u0394n seems right.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, especially for plasmonic sensors, sensitivity is S = (\u0394\u03bb/\u0394n) where \u03bb is the wavelength. But in THz metamaterials, they often use frequency instead. So the formula depends on whether they're measuring shift in wavelength or frequency. Since THz is usually in frequency terms, maybe \u0394f over \u0394n is correct.\n\nSo the answer is S = \u0394f / \u0394n. The explanation would be that sensitivity is the ratio of the resonant frequency shift to the change in refractive index caused by the presence of the target analyte, like the coronavirus.\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: The sensitivity of a metamaterial-based sensor in the THz band for coronavirus detection is typically calculated as the shift in resonant frequency (\u0394f) per unit change in the refractive index (\u0394n) of the surrounding medium caused by the presence of the target analyte. This is represented by the formula **S = \u0394f / \u0394n**, where \u0394f is the frequency shift observed in simulations (e.g., using CST Microwave Studio) and \u0394n is the refractive index variation due to coronavirus binding. CST simulations compare the resonant frequency of the metamaterial structure before and after introducing a dielectric layer (or analyte) mimicking the virus, allowing sensitivity quantification. \n\nAnswer: \\( S = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta n} \\)\\  \nConfidence: 90%",
