  "question": "What is the smallest number $e$ such that there exists a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with precisely $e$ edges and $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest number e such that there's a simple, connected graph \u03b3 with exactly e edges and an automorphism group of order 3. Hmm, automorphism group of order 3 means the graph has exactly three automorphisms. Let me think about how automorphisms work in graphs. Automorphisms are permutations of the vertices that preserve adjacency. So the graph must have some symmetry, but not too much, since the order is 3, which is a prime. \n\nFirst, I recall that the automorphism group of a graph must divide the factorial of the number of vertices, by Lagrange's theorem. Since the order here is 3, which is prime, the group could be cyclic of order 3. So maybe the graph has a cyclic symmetry of order 3. But what does such a graph look like?\n\nLet's start by considering small graphs. The simplest connected graphs are trees. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. If I can find a tree with automorphism group of order 3, that would give me a low edge count. Wait, but trees with non-trivial automorphisms usually have some kind of symmetry. For example, a star graph (like K1,n) has a large automorphism group because you can permute the leaves. But maybe a more asymmetric tree would have a smaller automorphism group.\n\nWait, but trees can have automorphism groups of various sizes. Let me think. The smallest non-trivial trees are paths. The path graph on two vertices (a single edge) has automorphism group of order 2, because you can swap the two vertices. The path on three vertices (a line of two edges) also has automorphism group of order 2; flipping the two end vertices. The path on four vertices (three edges) has automorphism group of order 2 again. So maybe paths have automorphism groups of order 2 for longer paths as well? Or does it get larger? For a path of length n (n+1 vertices), the automorphism group is order 2 because you can reverse the path. So paths have automorphism group of order 2. So perhaps trees can't have automorphism group of order 3. So maybe I need to look beyond trees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a graph with cycles. Let's think. The smallest cycles are triangles, squares, etc. The cycle graph C3 (triangle) has automorphism group of order 6 (dihedral group of order 6). So that's too big. The cycle C4 (square) has automorphism group of order 8 (dihedral group of order 8). Still too big. So cycles themselves have high automorphism groups. What if we add some structures to the cycle to break some symmetries but still retain some?\n\nSuppose we take a cycle and attach some trees to it. For example, take a triangle (3-cycle) and attach a leaf to each vertex. Then the automorphism group would be the same as permuting the three leaves, right? But if each vertex of the triangle has a distinct structure attached, maybe we can reduce the automorphism group. Wait, but if each vertex has the same kind of attachment (like a leaf), then the automorphism group becomes the symmetric group on the three leaves. But the full automorphism group would be the dihedral group of the triangle combined with permuting the leaves. Wait, no, if each vertex of the triangle has a leaf attached, then the graph is like a triangle with three leaves, each attached to a different vertex. Then any automorphism must permute the vertices of the triangle and correspondingly permute the leaves. So the automorphism group would be the same as the automorphism group of the triangle, which is D3 (order 6), because you can rotate the triangle or flip it, which would also move the leaves. So that's still order 6, which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe attach different structures. Suppose we attach a different number of leaves to each vertex. For example, one vertex has a leaf, another has two leaves, and the third has none. Then the automorphism group would be trivial, perhaps. But that might reduce the automorphism group too much.\n\nWait, but the question requires the automorphism group of order exactly 3. So maybe there is a graph where the only automorphisms are the cyclic permutations of three vertices, but not the reflections. Hmm. How can we get a cyclic group of order 3 as the automorphism group?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take a graph that is a triangular prism. Wait, no, that might have a larger automorphism group. Or maybe a graph composed of three triangles connected in a certain way. Alternatively, think of a graph with three vertices forming a triangle and some additional edges or vertices connected in such a way that only rotations are possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph is the Frucht graph, but the Frucht graph has trivial automorphism group. That's no good. Wait, but the Frucht graph is the smallest graph with trivial automorphism group and certain properties, but maybe there are other graphs.\n\nAlternatively, think of a graph constructed by taking a 3-cycle and adding another edge in a way that breaks the symmetries except for rotation. Wait, if you take a triangle and add a pendant edge (a leaf) to one vertex, then the automorphism group would be trivial, because the leaf breaks all symmetries. Similarly, if you add leaves to two vertices, maybe you get an automorphism group of order 2 (swapping the two leaves). But adding leaves to all three vertices gives symmetry group D3 again.\n\nHmm. So perhaps this approach isn't working. Let's think differently. Since the automorphism group has order 3, which is prime, the group must be cyclic of order 3. So there must be an automorphism of order 3, and no others. So the graph must have a rotational symmetry of order 3 but no reflections. How can such a graph be constructed?\n\nLet me consider the graph known as the \"3-star\" or something like that. Wait, maybe take three triangles and connect them at a central vertex. Wait, but that might have more symmetry. Alternatively, take three vertices connected in a cycle, each with a distinct structure attached so that only cyclic permutations preserve the structure.\n\nAlternatively, construct a graph with three vertices of degree 2 arranged in a triangle, and each connected to another vertex. Wait, not sure. Let's try to draw a mental picture.\n\nConsider a graph with 6 vertices: let's think of two triangles connected in a certain way. Wait, suppose we have vertices A, B, C forming a triangle, and D, E, F forming another triangle. Then connect A to D, B to E, C to F. Then maybe there's a rotation symmetry cycling A->B->C and D->E->F. But this graph might have automorphism group order 6, similar to the dihedral group. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me think of a graph with 4 vertices. Wait, no, 4 vertices. A connected graph with 4 vertices can have at most 6 edges (complete graph). But K4 has automorphism group S4, which is way too big. So perhaps a graph with more vertices.\n\nWait, let me think of the graph with 7 vertices: 3 pairs of vertices connected in a way that allows a cyclic rotation. For example, take three edges forming a triangle, and each vertex in the triangle has another edge leading to a distinct node. So each vertex in the triangle has degree 3, connected to one external vertex. Then, the external vertices are leaves. So the graph is a triangle with each vertex having a leaf. Then, the automorphism group would be the same as the automorphism group of the triangle, which is D3 of order 6. Because you can rotate the triangle and flip it, which would permute the leaves accordingly. So that's order 6. But we need order 3.\n\nSo maybe if the external vertices aren't leaves but have some structure that prevents reflections. For example, if each external vertex has a different structure. Wait, but if they are asymmetric, then the automorphism group would be reduced. Suppose each external vertex has a different number of leaves attached. But that might make the automorphism group trivial. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, instead of connecting each triangle vertex to a single leaf, connect them to different graphs. For example, connect one to a leaf, one to a path of length 2, and another to something else. Then only rotations would preserve the connections. But this requires careful construction. Let's try to imagine: Take the triangle ABC. Attach to A a single leaf (D). Attach to B a path of two edges (B-E-F). Attach to C a different structure, maybe a triangle (C-G-H, forming a triangle C-G-H-C). Then, any automorphism would need to map A to a vertex with a single leaf, B to a vertex with a path, and C to a vertex with a triangle. Therefore, such a graph would have only the identity automorphism, so the group is trivial. That's no good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all three attached structures are isomorphic but arranged in such a way that a rotation preserves them, but a reflection does not. For example, each external vertex is connected to a path of length 2, but each path is attached in a rotational manner. Wait, maybe not. If each of the triangle's vertices is connected to a path of two edges, then rotating the triangle would map each path to the next, so the automorphism group would still be D3, allowing rotations and reflections. So that's order 6. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, make the attached structures such that they break the reflection symmetry but allow rotation. For example, each path attached to the triangle vertices has a different orientation. Wait, but in a simple graph, edges don't have directions. Hmm. Maybe if the attached structures are asymmetric but in a way that when rotated, they still fit. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of a graph with 3 vertices connected in a triangle and each vertex has a different number of leaves. For example, vertex A has 1 leaf, B has 2 leaves, and C has 3 leaves. Then, the only automorphism would be the identity, because the number of leaves breaks all symmetries. So automorphism group trivial. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe there's a known graph with automorphism group order 3. Let me recall some examples. The smallest non-trivial automorphism group for a graph is order 2 (like the path graph on two vertices). The Frucht graph has order 1. But perhaps some other graphs.\n\nWait, maybe the graph is the triangular prism with one edge removed. Let me think. The triangular prism has two triangles connected by three edges. If I remove one of the connecting edges, does that reduce the automorphism group? The original prism has automorphism group of order 12 (since each triangle can be rotated and the prisms can be swapped). If we remove an edge, maybe reduce it. But not sure. Alternatively, maybe a different graph.\n\nAnother idea: take a graph where three vertices form a triangle and each is connected to a central vertex. So a graph with four vertices: triangle plus a central hub. Wait, but then the central vertex is connected to all three, so the automorphism group would be S3, which is order 6, permuting the outer triangle's vertices. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph with a central vertex connected to three other vertices, each of which is part of a different structure. For example, one has a leaf, another is connected to another vertex, etc. But again, unless the structures are symmetric, the automorphism group may be trivial.\n\nWait, maybe the graph is the Wagner graph? No, the Wagner graph has automorphism group of order 16, I think. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, look for a graph with 9 edges. Wait, let's think numerically. The minimal number of edges for a connected graph is n-1 (tree). So if I can find a tree with automorphism group order 3, that would give e = n-1. But does such a tree exist?\n\nWait, in trees, the automorphism group is determined by the symmetries of the tree structure. For a tree to have automorphism group of order 3, the tree must have a structure where the automorphisms form a group of order 3. Since 3 is prime, the automorphism group must be cyclic of order 3. How can a tree have such a group?\n\nA possible candidate is a rooted tree where the root has three isomorphic branches. But in rooted trees, the root is fixed, so automorphisms would permute the branches if they are isomorphic. If the root is fixed, then the automorphism group could be S3 if there are three branches, but if the branches are structured such that only cyclic permutations are possible. Wait, but in a rooted tree, automorphisms must fix the root. So if the root has three children, each of which is the root of an isomorphic subtree, then the automorphism group would be the automorphism group of the subtree multiplied by the symmetric group on the children. But if the subtrees are asymmetric, then the automorphism group is S3. But if the subtrees have some automorphisms themselves, then it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, construct a tree where the root has three children, and each child has a different structure, so that only cyclic permutations are possible. Wait, that might not work. If the subtrees are different, then no automorphism can permute them. So to have automorphisms, the subtrees must be isomorphic. So if the root has three isomorphic subtrees, then the automorphism group can permute them, leading to S3 if they are symmetric. But unless the subtrees have automorphisms themselves, the group would be S3. But we need cyclic of order 3. How?\n\nAlternatively, consider a tree where a node has three children, each of which is a chain of length 2. So each child has a single child itself. Then the automorphism group would permute those three grandchildren. But in this case, the automorphisms can permute the three children of the root, each of which is a path of length 2. So the automorphism group would be S3, which is order 6. Because you can permute the three branches in any order. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if each of the three subtrees has a structure that allows only cyclic permutations. For instance, each subtree is a path that is directed in a circular way. Wait, but in a tree, direction isn't a thing. So maybe not.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe trees can't have automorphism groups of order 3. Let's consider some numbers. For a tree, the number of automorphisms depends on the structure. The smallest trees with non-trivial automorphism groups are those with some symmetry. For example, the star graph K1,3 has automorphism group S3 (order 6). The path graph on 4 vertices (3 edges) has automorphism group order 2. So maybe trees can't have automorphism groups of order 3. If that's the case, then we need to look for a graph with cycles, but not too symmetric.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's look for the minimal number of edges. We need the smallest e such that there exists a connected graph with e edges and automorphism group of order 3. The minimal connected graphs are trees, but maybe trees can't have automorphism group order 3, so the next possibility is graphs with cycles. The smallest cycles are triangles, squares, etc. Let's try to find a graph with a cycle and some additional edges that reduce the automorphism group to 3.\n\nConsider the graph formed by a triangle (3 edges) with a single additional edge. For example, connect one vertex to a new vertex. So now we have a triangle with one vertex connected to a leaf. Let's analyze the automorphism group. The triangle has automorphism group D3 (order 6). Adding a leaf to one vertex breaks some symmetries. Specifically, the leaf is fixed, so the automorphism group of the new graph must fix that vertex. Therefore, the automorphism group is trivial if the leaf is attached to a single vertex. Wait, suppose we have vertices A, B, C forming a triangle, and vertex D connected to A. Then any automorphism must map A to itself (since it's the only one with a leaf), and B and C must be mapped among themselves. So the automorphism group would be the group generated by swapping B and C. That's order 2. So the automorphism group here is order 2. Not 3.\n\nBut what if we add something else. Suppose we take the triangle and add two leaves to one vertex. Then, the automorphism group would fix that vertex and leave the two leaves to be swapped. So the automorphism group would be order 2 (swap the leaves). Still not 3.\n\nAlternatively, take the triangle and add three leaves, one to each vertex. Then the automorphism group is D3 (order 6), as we thought earlier.\n\nAnother idea: take a cycle of length 6 (hexagon) and connect every other vertex. Wait, no, that makes a bipartite graph. Not sure. Alternatively, use a graph with three components connected in a way that allows rotation but not reflection. Wait, but the graph must be connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph is the triangular prism graph. That's two triangles connected by three edges. The automorphism group here is S3 \u00d7 C2, maybe? Not sure. The automorphism group of the triangular prism is dihedral of order 12, I think. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph that is a 3-cycle connected to another 3-cycle by a single edge. So, two triangles sharing no vertices but connected by an edge. Then, the automorphism group might swap the two triangles if they are identical, leading to order 2. But if the triangles are connected asymmetrically, maybe the automorphism group is trivial.\n\nAlternatively, create a graph with three vertices forming a triangle, and each vertex is connected to a separate 2-path. Wait, that's similar to earlier thoughts. Suppose the three 2-paths are arranged such that a rotation permutes them. But unless they are symmetric, the automorphism group would not act.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for known graphs with automorphism groups of order 3. A quick recollection: the Petersen graph has automorphism group of order 120, so no. The cube graph has order 48. Maybe some smaller graphs.\n\nWait, consider the graph formed by three triangles sharing a common vertex. Let's say, one central vertex connected to three different triangles. So, central vertex A connected to B, C, D. Then, B connected to E and F to form a triangle, C connected to G and H, D connected to I and J. Wait, but this graph is quite big. The automorphism group would need to permute the three triangles. If each triangle is identical, then the automorphism group could be S3, permuting the three triangles. But that's order 6. If the triangles are different, the group is trivial. So no.\n\nAlternatively, make each triangle have a different structure. But then no automorphisms. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is 9 edges. Let's think: suppose we have a graph with 6 vertices. The minimal connected graph with automorphism group order 3. If the graph has 6 vertices, a connected graph can have at minimum 5 edges (a tree). But maybe the graph has 6 vertices and 9 edges. Wait, 6 vertices can have up to 15 edges. Not sure. Let me think of a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges.\n\nAlternatively, think of the complete bipartite graph K3,3. Its automorphism group is order 72 ( (3!)(3!)2 ), which is much too big.\n\nAlternatively, consider a graph composed of two disjoint triangles connected by a single edge. Wait, but then the automorphism group can swap the triangles if they are connected symmetrically. For example, if the edge connects corresponding vertices in each triangle. Then the automorphism group might be order 6 (swap triangles and rotate). But again, order 6.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph with a 3-cycle and another 3-cycle connected such that each vertex in the first cycle is connected to a distinct vertex in the second cycle. That might have a larger automorphism group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph is the 3-sun graph, which is a triangle with each vertex connected to a pendant vertex. So 6 vertices total. The automorphism group here would be D3 (order 6), as each pendant is attached to a triangle vertex, and you can rotate the triangle, permuting the pendant vertices. So order 6.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of a graph that's more asymmetric but still has some rotational symmetry. Let me consider graphs on 4 vertices. For example, the diamond graph (K4 minus an edge) has automorphism group of order 4. The paw graph (a triangle with a pendant edge) has automorphism group of order 2. So 4 vertices won't work.\n\nWait, going back to the problem. The minimal number of edges e such that there exists a connected graph with e edges and automorphism group order 3. Let's try to construct such a graph.\n\nSuppose we take a graph with 4 vertices. The connected graphs on 4 vertices have up to 6 edges (complete graph). The possible automorphism groups for connected graphs on 4 vertices include S4, A4, D4, various smaller groups. But none of order 3. Because 3 doesn't divide 4! = 24 in a way that allows a subgroup of order 3. Wait, but 3 divides 24, so there could be a subgroup of order 3. For example, a cycle of three elements. But does any connected graph on 4 vertices have automorphism group of order 3?\n\nFor example, take the path graph with 4 vertices (P4). It has automorphism group order 2. The complete graph K4 has S4, order 24. The cycle graph C4 has automorphism group D4, order 8. The diamond graph (K4 missing one edge) has automorphism group of order 4. The paw graph has order 2. The star graph K1,3 has automorphism group S3, order 6. So no connected graph on 4 vertices has automorphism group order 3.\n\nHow about 5 vertices? Let's see. The possible automorphism groups of connected graphs on 5 vertices. For example, the cycle graph C5 has automorphism group D5, order 10. The complete graph K5 has S5, order 120. The star graph K1,4 has S4, order 24. Other graphs might have smaller automorphism groups.\n\nWait, but maybe a graph with 5 vertices and automorphism group of order 3. Let's see. Suppose we have a graph with 5 vertices where three of them form a triangle, and the other two are connected in a way that allows a cyclic permutation of the triangle. For example, let vertices A, B, C form a triangle, and vertices D and E connected to A and B respectively. Wait, not sure. Let me try to be more precise.\n\nSuppose vertices A, B, C form a triangle. Vertex D is connected to A, and vertex E is connected to B. What's the automorphism group here? Any automorphism must fix D and E since D is only connected to A, and E is only connected to B. So swapping A and B would require swapping D and E as well. If D and E are connected to different vertices, then the automorphism group may only allow swapping A and B if we also swap D and E. But if D and E have different connections, maybe not. For example, if D is connected only to A, and E is connected only to B, then an automorphism can swap A and B and swap D and E. But if D and E are otherwise different (like D has degree 1 and E has degree 1), then such a swap is allowed. Therefore, the automorphism group would have order 2, generated by swapping A<->B, D<->E. So that's order 2. Not 3.\n\nAlternatively, if we have three vertices in a triangle and two other vertices each connected to different vertices of the triangle. For example, D connected to A and E connected to B. Then, the automorphism group might still be order 2. If the connections are symmetric, maybe order 2. If the connections are asymmetric, trivial.\n\nAlternatively, create a graph where the triangle's automorphisms are restricted by the rest of the graph. Suppose we have a triangle A, B, C. Vertex D is connected to A and B. Vertex E is connected to B and C. Vertex F is connected to C and A. Then, the graph becomes a 3-dimensional structure. But now it's getting complex, and the automorphism group might be larger.\n\nAlternatively, take the triangle A, B, C and connect each to a distinct structure. For example, A connected to a leaf D, B connected to a leaf E, and C connected to a two-edge path F-G. Then, the automorphism group would have to fix C since it's the only one connected to a path of length 2. Then, A and B can be swapped if their leaves are also swapped. So automorphism group order 2. Still not 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a graph with 6 vertices. Let's try to think. Suppose we have two triangles connected by a bridge. For example, A-B-C-A and D-E-F-D, connected by an edge between C and D. Then, the automorphism group might allow swapping the two triangles if they are symmetric. But each triangle is connected to the bridge via a different node (C and D), so if the bridge is between C and D, then swapping the triangles would require swapping C and D, which might not form an automorphism since the rest of the connections are preserved. But this might lead to an automorphism group of order 2 (swapping the two triangles and their respective parts). Not 3.\n\nAlternatively, create a graph with a central node connected to three others, each forming a triangle with the central node. So, central node O connected to A, B, C. Then, O-A-B-O forms a triangle, O-B-C-O forms another, and O-C-A-O the third. Wait, but that would require multiple edges between O and each of A, B, C, which is not allowed in a simple graph. Alternatively, have O connected to A, B, C, and each pair among A, B, C forms a triangle. Then, A-B-C-A is a triangle, and each is connected to O. Then, the graph is K4 minus three edges (if O is connected to each). Wait, no, if O is connected to A, B, C and A, B, C form a triangle, then it's K4 minus the edges OA, OB, OC. Wait, no, that would not be a triangle. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph formed by three triangles sharing a common edge. So, the common edge is between two vertices, and each triangle shares this edge. Then, the automorphism group might allow rotation among the triangles. Hmm, but in a simple graph, you can't have multiple edges. So this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph with a 9-edge structure. Wait, but I need to find the minimal e. Let's think of the minimal connected graphs with cycles. The smallest possible e for a connected graph that's not a tree is one more edge than a tree. For example, a tree with n-1 edges, and one more edge makes a cycle. So for example, if we have a graph with 4 vertices, it's a tree (3 edges) plus one edge, making a cycle (4 edges total). So the smallest e where the graph has a cycle is n-1 +1 = n. So for 4 vertices, 4 edges.\n\nBut an n-vertex graph with cycles might have more automorphisms. For example, the cycle graph C4 has 4 vertices and 4 edges, automorphism group order 8. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the graph is a triangle with a path of length 2 attached to one vertex. So edges are triangle (3 edges) plus two more edges (total 5 edges). The automorphism group would fix the vertex with the path attached, leading to trivial or order 1 automorphism group. No.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph that is a triangle connected to another triangle via a single edge. So, two triangles connected by a bridge. Then, the automorphism group might swap the triangles if they are symmetric. The bridge is between two vertices, one from each triangle. So if the connection is symmetric, you can swap the triangles, leading to automorphism group of order 2. If not, trivial. So order 2.\n\nAnother approach: check known graphs with automorphism group order 3. From some graph theory knowledge, such graphs do exist. For example, the skeleton of the triangular prism has automorphism group order 12, but maybe a different graph.\n\nWait, I recall that the smallest graph with automorphism group of order 3 has 9 edges. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph formed by three copies of K2 connected to a central K1,3. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the graph called the \"cube-connected cycles,\" but I don't think that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of a graph with three vertices of degree 3 forming a triangle, each connected to two leaves. Wait, let's see: vertices A, B, C forming a triangle. Each connected to two leaves. So A connected to D and E, B connected to F and G, C connected to H and I. That's a lot of vertices. The automorphism group would need to permute the triangle's vertices and their attached leaves. But each vertex has two leaves, so swapping the leaves would contribute to the automorphism group. However, the automorphism group would be the wreath product of the triangle's automorphism group and the symmetries of the leaves. But each leaf pair is fixed to their respective nodes, so the automorphism group would be D3 (order 6), permuting the triangle vertices and swapping the leaves for each if possible. So order 6 again.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Maybe I should look for a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges. For example, take two triangles sharing a common vertex. So total vertices: 3 + 3 -1 = 5. Edges: 3 + 3 -0 = 6. The automorphism group would fix the common vertex and allow flipping the two triangles if they are symmetric. So automorphism group would be order 2 (swap the two triangles). Not 3.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph formed by a triangle with each vertex connected to a fourth vertex. So, the graph has 4 vertices: A, B, C forming a triangle, and D connected to A, B, C. So edges: AB, BC, CA, DA, DB, DC. Total edges: 6. This graph is K4 minus the three edges AD, BD, CD, but wait, no. Actually, it's a triangle plus a central vertex connected to all three. This graph is called the \"3-fold wheel\" or \"windmill graph\". Its automorphism group is S3 (order 6), because you can permute the outer triangle vertices freely while fixing the center. So that's order 6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe if we have the center connected to only two vertices of the triangle. Then the automorphism group would be smaller. For example, center D connected to A and B but not C. Then, the automorphism group must fix C and swap A and B if possible. But since D is connected to A and B, an automorphism can swap A and B if it also swaps their connections. But since D is connected to both, that's allowed. So the automorphism group would be order 2. Still not 3.\n\nAnother idea: the graph must have an automorphism of order 3 (a permutation of the vertices that cycles three vertices and fixes others), and no other automorphisms. So maybe a graph with a 3-cycle and some additional edges that are arranged asymmetrically except for the 3-cycle symmetry.\n\nFor example, take a triangle A, B, C. Then, add three more vertices D, E, F. Connect D to A, E to B, and F to C. Now, each triangle vertex has a leaf. The automorphism group is D3 (order 6), as before. But if we add another edge, say, connect D to E. Now, the structure is more complex. The automorphism group might now be different. Let's see. If we rotate the triangle A->B->C->A, then D is connected to A, E to B, F to C. If we rotate, D moves to E, which is connected to B (now A). Wait, no, it's complicated. If there's an edge D-E, then rotating the triangle would require that edge to move to E-F or something else, which it's not. So maybe this graph's automorphism group is reduced.\n\nAlternatively, create a graph where three vertices form a triangle, and each has a unique connection to other parts of the graph. For example, vertex A is connected to D, B is connected to E and F, and C is connected to G. Such asymmetry would mean only rotations that preserve the unique connections are possible, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, take the triangle ABC and add edges AD, BE, CF, where D, E, F are distinct vertices. Then, if you rotate the triangle, D must go to E to F to D, but since these are distinct, the automorphism would have to cycle D, E, F as well. If these outer vertices form their own cycle or structure that allows this. For example, if D, E, F are connected in a cycle too, then rotating both cycles would give an automorphism. But then the automorphism group could be larger.\n\nAlternatively, connect D to E, E to F, F to D to form another triangle. Then, the entire graph has two triangles connected such that each vertex of the first triangle is connected to a vertex of the second triangle. So A-D, B-E, C-F. Then, the automorphism group could rotate both triangles simultaneously, leading to a cyclic group of order 3. If there are no other automorphisms, this would give order 3. Let me check.\n\nIn this case, the graph has two triangles connected by three edges (A-D, B-E, C-F). The total edges are 3 (first triangle) + 3 (second triangle) + 3 (connections) = 9 edges. Now, the automorphisms would include permutations that rotate both triangles simultaneously. For example, the permutation (A B C)(D E F) would map each vertex to the next in their respective triangles and preserve the connections (A-D becomes B-E, etc.). However, can there be other automorphisms? For example, flipping both triangles. If we apply a reflection to both triangles, swapping A and C, B and A (no, a reflection would swap A and C, B stays, etc.? Wait, a reflection in a triangle would be a permutation like (A C)(B). But in the second triangle D-E-F, applying (D F)(E). Then, the connections A-D, B-E, C-F would become C-F, B-E, A-D. So the edge C-F becomes A-D, but A-D is still an edge. So this permutation would preserve the graph structure. Therefore, the automorphism group includes these reflections as well, leading to an automorphism group of order 6 (rotations and reflections). So again, order 6. Not 3.\n\nSo maybe this approach isn't working. Let's consider the number of edges. The graph I described has 9 edges. If such a graph has automorphism group of order 6, but we need one of order 3, maybe there's a modification. Suppose we break the reflection symmetry. For example, in the second triangle D-E-F, add an extra edge to one vertex, making it asymmetric. Say, connect D to G. Now, the second triangle is no longer a triangle; it's D-E-F-D plus an edge D-G. Then, any automorphism must fix G, as it's only connected to D. Therefore, the reflection automorphism that swaps D and F would require moving G to F, but since G is only connected to D, that's impossible. Therefore, the only automorphisms are the rotations (A B C)(D E F) and possibly others, but with G fixed. Wait, but if G is only connected to D, then rotating D-E-F would require G to move to E or F, which it can't because they don't have a connection to G. Therefore, the automorphism group now is trivial for the second triangle. Thus, the only possible automorphism is rotating A-B-C and D-E-F simultaneously if possible. But since the second triangle is now not a pure triangle (it's a tetrahedron with an extra edge?), the rotation might not preserve the edges. This is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal such graph might indeed have 9 edges. If the answer is 9, but how to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 3, but no, because a triangle has automorphism group 6. So maybe the next possible. Let's think.\n\nIf I can't find a graph with e=9 edges, maybe the answer is 9. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 6. Let me think: take the graph with two triangles connected by three edges as described earlier. But wait, that was 9 edges. Alternatively, a graph with a 3-cycle and three leaves attached, which is 6 edges. But that's order 6.\n\nWait, another idea: the graph known as the \"3-prism\" which is two triangles connected by a 3-edge matching. That's called the triangular prism graph, which has 6 vertices and 9 edges. Its automorphism group is order 12. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, take the complete bipartite graph K3,3. It has 9 edges and automorphism group order 72. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a graph with 6 vertices and 6 edges. For example, the graph formed by a triangle and three leaves attached to one vertex. That's 3 + 3 = 6 edges. The automorphism group is D3 (order 6), which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, a different graph with 6 edges. For example, the cube's skeleton has 12 edges, but that's too much.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 9. Because the triangular prism graph has 9 edges and automorphism group order 12, but if we modify it by adding or removing edges to reduce the automorphism group to 3. Suppose we take the triangular prism and add an edge that breaks some symmetries. For example, connect one vertex from the first triangle to a non-corresponding vertex in the second triangle. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, start with a graph where the automorphism group is cyclic of order 3. For example, a graph with a 3-cycle and some additional edges that are arranged such that rotation by 120 degrees preserves the graph, but reflections do not. For example, a graph with a triangle and each vertex connected to a fourth vertex in a cyclic manner. Wait, but that would create a K4, which has a larger automorphism group.\n\nAlternatively, consider a graph with 7 vertices: a triangle connected to a 4-cycle in a specific way. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the graph as having three \"arms\" arranged in a cyclic manner. If each arm is connected such that rotating them preserves the graph but reflecting doesn't. For example, each arm could be a path of different lengths. Wait, but then the automorphism group would be trivial.\n\nI'm starting to think that the minimal number of edges e is 9. Because the triangular prism graph has 9 edges and automorphism group of order 12, but perhaps another graph with 9 edges has group order 3. Alternatively, maybe there's a graph with 6 edges and automorphism group order 3. But I haven't been able to construct one.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph with vertices labeled 0 to 5, edges forming two disjoint triangles: 0-1-2-0 and 3-4-5-3, plus edges 0-3, 1-4, 2-5. This is the bipartite graph K3,3, which has automorphism group order 72. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, connect the triangles with a single edge. So, edges of two triangles plus one connecting edge. This graph has 3+3+1=7 edges. The automorphism group might swap the triangles if the connecting edge is symmetric. For example, connecting a vertex from each triangle. If the connection is between vertex 0 of the first triangle and vertex 3 of the second, then automorphisms could swap the triangles if the graphs are symmetric. But since the connection is between specific vertices, swapping would require the connecting edge to be preserved. This might lead to an automorphism group of order 2 (swap the triangles and adjust the connector edge). Or trivial if not symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, connect each vertex of the first triangle to a unique vertex in the second. For example, 0-3, 1-4, 2-5. That's the K3,3 graph again.\n\nAlternatively, make the connections asymmetric. For example, 0 connected to 3, 1 connected to 4, and 2 connected to 4. Now, the second triangle has vertex 4 with two edges. This would break symmetry. The automorphism group might now be order 2 or 1.\n\nI'm not making progress. Let me think of known results. The automorphism group of a graph must be non-trivial. The smallest non-trivial groups are order 2, 3, etc. It's known that there exist graphs with automorphism groups of any given order, but constructing them is another matter.\n\nAccording to some references, the smallest graph with automorphism group order 3 has 9 vertices. For example, the graph is the Frucht graph but with modifications. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 9 edges.\n\nWait, think of the graph where each vertex is in a position that can be rotated but not reflected. For example, a graph consisting of three triangles arranged in a cycle. Each triangle is connected to the next in a cycle. Such a graph might have rotational symmetry of order 3 but no reflections. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph formed by a 9-edge graph that is the disjoint union of three triangles. But the graph must be connected. So three triangles connected in a line. For example, triangle A connected to triangle B via an edge, and triangle B connected to triangle C via an edge. Then, the automorphism group might allow swapping the end triangles, giving order 2. But not 3.\n\nAlternatively, connect them in a cycle. Three triangles connected in a cycle. Each triangle connected to the next by an edge. Then, the automorphism group allows rotation of the three triangles, leading to order 3. But in this case, the total edges would be 3*3 +3=12 edges. Too many.\n\nAlternatively, take a triangle and add an edge from each vertex to a new vertex. So, central vertex D connected to A, B, C. Then, the graph has edges AB, BC, CA, DA, DB, DC (6 edges). The automorphism group is S3, order 6. Still too big.\n\nAlternatively, take a triangle and add a fourth vertex connected to A and B. Then, edges AB, BC, CA, DA, DB. This graph has automorphism group order 2 (swap A and B if possible). Because if D is connected to A and B, then swapping A and B would preserve the graph, but flipping the triangle would require swapping C as well, which is connected to both A and B. Wait, if A and B are swapped, then C remains connected to both, so the triangle is preserved. So the automorphism group here would consist of swapping A and B, and swapping D accordingly. But D is only connected to A and B, so swapping A and B would swap D's connections. But D is a vertex; swapping A and B would swap their edges to D. So the automorphism here is the transposition (A B) which swaps A and B, and swaps their connections to D and leaves C alone. However, this transposition must also preserve the edge CA, which becomes CB, which is still present. Similarly, edge CB becomes CA. So yes, swapping A and B would preserve the graph. So the automorphism group here is of order 2. Hence, this graph has automorphism group of order 2. Still not 3.\n\nAnother approach: look for a graph with 9 edges and automorphism group order 3. If such a graph exists, then the answer is 9. Otherwise, higher.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is 3 edges. But a triangle has 3 edges and automorphism group of order 6. So no.\n\nAfter spending considerable time and not finding a graph with fewer edges, perhaps the minimal e is 9. I'm not entirely sure, but given the options and the difficulty in constructing a graph with automorphism group order 3 with fewer edges, it's possible that the answer is 9.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To find the smallest number of edges \\( e \\) such that there exists a simple, connected graph \\( \\gamma \\) with precisely \\( e \\) edges and automorphism group \\( |\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3 \\), we analyze graphs with cyclic symmetry of order 3 but no reflections.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest number e such that there's a simple, connected graph \u03b3 with exactly e edges and an automorphism group of order 3. Hmm, automorphism group of order 3 means the graph has exactly three automorphisms. Let me think about how automorphisms work in graphs. Automorphisms are permutations of the vertices that preserve adjacency. So the graph must have some symmetry, but not too much, since the order is 3, which is a prime. \n\nFirst, I recall that the automorphism group of a graph must divide the factorial of the number of vertices, by Lagrange's theorem. Since the order here is 3, which is prime, the group could be cyclic of order 3. So maybe the graph has a cyclic symmetry of order 3. But what does such a graph look like?\n\nLet's start by considering small graphs. The simplest connected graphs are trees. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. If I can find a tree with automorphism group of order 3, that would give me a low edge count. Wait, but trees with non-trivial automorphisms usually have some kind of symmetry. For example, a star graph (like K1,n) has a large automorphism group because you can permute the leaves. But maybe a more asymmetric tree would have a smaller automorphism group.\n\nWait, but trees can have automorphism groups of various sizes. Let me think. The smallest non-trivial trees are paths. The path graph on two vertices (a single edge) has automorphism group of order 2, because you can swap the two vertices. The path on three vertices (a line of two edges) also has automorphism group of order 2; flipping the two end vertices. The path on four vertices (three edges) has automorphism group of order 2 again. So maybe paths have automorphism groups of order 2 for longer paths as well? Or does it get larger? For a path of length n (n+1 vertices), the automorphism group is order 2 because you can reverse the path. So paths have automorphism group of order 2. So perhaps trees can't have automorphism group of order 3. So maybe I need to look beyond trees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a graph with cycles. Let's think. The smallest cycles are triangles, squares, etc. The cycle graph C3 (triangle) has automorphism group of order 6 (dihedral group of order 6). So that's too big. The cycle C4 (square) has automorphism group of order 8 (dihedral group of order 8). Still too big. So cycles themselves have high automorphism groups. What if we add some structures to the cycle to break some symmetries but still retain some?\n\nSuppose we take a cycle and attach some trees to it. For example, take a triangle (3-cycle) and attach a leaf to each vertex. Then the automorphism group would be the same as permuting the three leaves, right? But if each vertex of the triangle has a distinct structure attached, maybe we can reduce the automorphism group. Wait, but if each vertex has the same kind of attachment (like a leaf), then the automorphism group becomes the symmetric group on the three leaves. But the full automorphism group would be the dihedral group of the triangle combined with permuting the leaves. Wait, no, if each vertex of the triangle has a leaf attached, then the graph is like a triangle with three leaves, each attached to a different vertex. Then any automorphism must permute the vertices of the triangle and correspondingly permute the leaves. So the automorphism group would be the same as the automorphism group of the triangle, which is D3 (order 6), because you can rotate the triangle or flip it, which would also move the leaves. So that's still order 6, which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe attach different structures. Suppose we attach a different number of leaves to each vertex. For example, one vertex has a leaf, another has two leaves, and the third has none. Then the automorphism group would be trivial, perhaps. But that might reduce the automorphism group too much.\n\nWait, but the question requires the automorphism group of order exactly 3. So maybe there is a graph where the only automorphisms are the cyclic permutations of three vertices, but not the reflections. Hmm. How can we get a cyclic group of order 3 as the automorphism group?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take a graph that is a triangular prism. Wait, no, that might have a larger automorphism group. Or maybe a graph composed of three triangles connected in a certain way. Alternatively, think of a graph with three vertices forming a triangle and some additional edges or vertices connected in such a way that only rotations are possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph is the Frucht graph, but the Frucht graph has trivial automorphism group. That's no good. Wait, but the Frucht graph is the smallest graph with trivial automorphism group and certain properties, but maybe there are other graphs.\n\nAlternatively, think of a graph constructed by taking a 3-cycle and adding another edge in a way that breaks the symmetries except for rotation. Wait, if you take a triangle and add a pendant edge (a leaf) to one vertex, then the automorphism group would be trivial, because the leaf breaks all symmetries. Similarly, if you add leaves to two vertices, maybe you get an automorphism group of order 2 (swapping the two leaves). But adding leaves to all three vertices gives symmetry group D3 again.\n\nHmm. So perhaps this approach isn't working. Let's think differently. Since the automorphism group has order 3, which is prime, the group must be cyclic of order 3. So there must be an automorphism of order 3, and no others. So the graph must have a rotational symmetry of order 3 but no reflections. How can such a graph be constructed?\n\nLet me consider the graph known as the \"3-star\" or something like that. Wait, maybe take three triangles and connect them at a central vertex. Wait, but that might have more symmetry. Alternatively, take three vertices connected in a cycle, each with a distinct structure attached so that only cyclic permutations preserve the structure.\n\nAlternatively, construct a graph with three vertices of degree 2 arranged in a triangle, and each connected to another vertex. Wait, not sure. Let's try to draw a mental picture.\n\nConsider a graph with 6 vertices: let's think of two triangles connected in a certain way. Wait, suppose we have vertices A, B, C forming a triangle, and D, E, F forming another triangle. Then connect A to D, B to E, C to F. Then maybe there's a rotation symmetry cycling A->B->C and D->E->F. But this graph might have automorphism group order 6, similar to the dihedral group. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me think of a graph with 4 vertices. Wait, no, 4 vertices. A connected graph with 4 vertices can have at most 6 edges (complete graph). But K4 has automorphism group S4, which is way too big. So perhaps a graph with more vertices.\n\nWait, let me think of the graph with 7 vertices: 3 pairs of vertices connected in a way that allows a cyclic rotation. For example, take three edges forming a triangle, and each vertex in the triangle has another edge leading to a distinct node. So each vertex in the triangle has degree 3, connected to one external vertex. Then, the external vertices are leaves. So the graph is a triangle with each vertex having a leaf. Then, the automorphism group would be the same as the automorphism group of the triangle, which is D3 of order 6. Because you can rotate the triangle and flip it, which would permute the leaves accordingly. So that's order 6. But we need order 3.\n\nSo maybe if the external vertices aren't leaves but have some structure that prevents reflections. For example, if each external vertex has a different structure. Wait, but if they are asymmetric, then the automorphism group would be reduced. Suppose each external vertex has a different number of leaves attached. But that might make the automorphism group trivial. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, instead of connecting each triangle vertex to a single leaf, connect them to different graphs. For example, connect one to a leaf, one to a path of length 2, and another to something else. Then only rotations would preserve the connections. But this requires careful construction. Let's try to imagine: Take the triangle ABC. Attach to A a single leaf (D). Attach to B a path of two edges (B-E-F). Attach to C a different structure, maybe a triangle (C-G-H, forming a triangle C-G-H-C). Then, any automorphism would need to map A to a vertex with a single leaf, B to a vertex with a path, and C to a vertex with a triangle. Therefore, such a graph would have only the identity automorphism, so the group is trivial. That's no good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all three attached structures are isomorphic but arranged in such a way that a rotation preserves them, but a reflection does not. For example, each external vertex is connected to a path of length 2, but each path is attached in a rotational manner. Wait, maybe not. If each of the triangle's vertices is connected to a path of two edges, then rotating the triangle would map each path to the next, so the automorphism group would still be D3, allowing rotations and reflections. So that's order 6. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, make the attached structures such that they break the reflection symmetry but allow rotation. For example, each path attached to the triangle vertices has a different orientation. Wait, but in a simple graph, edges don't have directions. Hmm. Maybe if the attached structures are asymmetric but in a way that when rotated, they still fit. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of a graph with 3 vertices connected in a triangle and each vertex has a different number of leaves. For example, vertex A has 1 leaf, B has 2 leaves, and C has 3 leaves. Then, the only automorphism would be the identity, because the number of leaves breaks all symmetries. So automorphism group trivial. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe there's a known graph with automorphism group order 3. Let me recall some examples. The smallest non-trivial automorphism group for a graph is order 2 (like the path graph on two vertices). The Frucht graph has order 1. But perhaps some other graphs.\n\nWait, maybe the graph is the triangular prism with one edge removed. Let me think. The triangular prism has two triangles connected by three edges. If I remove one of the connecting edges, does that reduce the automorphism group? The original prism has automorphism group of order 12 (since each triangle can be rotated and the prisms can be swapped). If we remove an edge, maybe reduce it. But not sure. Alternatively, maybe a different graph.\n\nAnother idea: take a graph where three vertices form a triangle and each is connected to a central vertex. So a graph with four vertices: triangle plus a central hub. Wait, but then the central vertex is connected to all three, so the automorphism group would be S3, which is order 6, permuting the outer triangle's vertices. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph with a central vertex connected to three other vertices, each of which is part of a different structure. For example, one has a leaf, another is connected to another vertex, etc. But again, unless the structures are symmetric, the automorphism group may be trivial.\n\nWait, maybe the graph is the Wagner graph? No, the Wagner graph has automorphism group of order 16, I think. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, look for a graph with 9 edges. Wait, let's think numerically. The minimal number of edges for a connected graph is n-1 (tree). So if I can find a tree with automorphism group order 3, that would give e = n-1. But does such a tree exist?\n\nWait, in trees, the automorphism group is determined by the symmetries of the tree structure. For a tree to have automorphism group of order 3, the tree must have a structure where the automorphisms form a group of order 3. Since 3 is prime, the automorphism group must be cyclic of order 3. How can a tree have such a group?\n\nA possible candidate is a rooted tree where the root has three isomorphic branches. But in rooted trees, the root is fixed, so automorphisms would permute the branches if they are isomorphic. If the root is fixed, then the automorphism group could be S3 if there are three branches, but if the branches are structured such that only cyclic permutations are possible. Wait, but in a rooted tree, automorphisms must fix the root. So if the root has three children, each of which is the root of an isomorphic subtree, then the automorphism group would be the automorphism group of the subtree multiplied by the symmetric group on the children. But if the subtrees are asymmetric, then the automorphism group is S3. But if the subtrees have some automorphisms themselves, then it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, construct a tree where the root has three children, and each child has a different structure, so that only cyclic permutations are possible. Wait, that might not work. If the subtrees are different, then no automorphism can permute them. So to have automorphisms, the subtrees must be isomorphic. So if the root has three isomorphic subtrees, then the automorphism group can permute them, leading to S3 if they are symmetric. But unless the subtrees have automorphisms themselves, the group would be S3. But we need cyclic of order 3. How?\n\nAlternatively, consider a tree where a node has three children, each of which is a chain of length 2. So each child has a single child itself. Then the automorphism group would permute those three grandchildren. But in this case, the automorphisms can permute the three children of the root, each of which is a path of length 2. So the automorphism group would be S3, which is order 6. Because you can permute the three branches in any order. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if each of the three subtrees has a structure that allows only cyclic permutations. For instance, each subtree is a path that is directed in a circular way. Wait, but in a tree, direction isn't a thing. So maybe not.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe trees can't have automorphism groups of order 3. Let's consider some numbers. For a tree, the number of automorphisms depends on the structure. The smallest trees with non-trivial automorphism groups are those with some symmetry. For example, the star graph K1,3 has automorphism group S3 (order 6). The path graph on 4 vertices (3 edges) has automorphism group order 2. So maybe trees can't have automorphism groups of order 3. If that's the case, then we need to look for a graph with cycles, but not too symmetric.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's look for the minimal number of edges. We need the smallest e such that there exists a connected graph with e edges and automorphism group of order 3. The minimal connected graphs are trees, but maybe trees can't have automorphism group order 3, so the next possibility is graphs with cycles. The smallest cycles are triangles, squares, etc. Let's try to find a graph with a cycle and some additional edges that reduce the automorphism group to 3.\n\nConsider the graph formed by a triangle (3 edges) with a single additional edge. For example, connect one vertex to a new vertex. So now we have a triangle with one vertex connected to a leaf. Let's analyze the automorphism group. The triangle has automorphism group D3 (order 6). Adding a leaf to one vertex breaks some symmetries. Specifically, the leaf is fixed, so the automorphism group of the new graph must fix that vertex. Therefore, the automorphism group is trivial if the leaf is attached to a single vertex. Wait, suppose we have vertices A, B, C forming a triangle, and vertex D connected to A. Then any automorphism must map A to itself (since it's the only one with a leaf), and B and C must be mapped among themselves. So the automorphism group would be the group generated by swapping B and C. That's order 2. So the automorphism group here is order 2. Not 3.\n\nBut what if we add something else. Suppose we take the triangle and add two leaves to one vertex. Then, the automorphism group would fix that vertex and leave the two leaves to be swapped. So the automorphism group would be order 2 (swap the leaves). Still not 3.\n\nAlternatively, take the triangle and add three leaves, one to each vertex. Then the automorphism group is D3 (order 6), as we thought earlier.\n\nAnother idea: take a cycle of length 6 (hexagon) and connect every other vertex. Wait, no, that makes a bipartite graph. Not sure. Alternatively, use a graph with three components connected in a way that allows rotation but not reflection. Wait, but the graph must be connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph is the triangular prism graph. That's two triangles connected by three edges. The automorphism group here is S3 \u00d7 C2, maybe? Not sure. The automorphism group of the triangular prism is dihedral of order 12, I think. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph that is a 3-cycle connected to another 3-cycle by a single edge. So, two triangles sharing no vertices but connected by an edge. Then, the automorphism group might swap the two triangles if they are identical, leading to order 2. But if the triangles are connected asymmetrically, maybe the automorphism group is trivial.\n\nAlternatively, create a graph with three vertices forming a triangle, and each vertex is connected to a separate 2-path. Wait, that's similar to earlier thoughts. Suppose the three 2-paths are arranged such that a rotation permutes them. But unless they are symmetric, the automorphism group would not act.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for known graphs with automorphism groups of order 3. A quick recollection: the Petersen graph has automorphism group of order 120, so no. The cube graph has order 48. Maybe some smaller graphs.\n\nWait, consider the graph formed by three triangles sharing a common vertex. Let's say, one central vertex connected to three different triangles. So, central vertex A connected to B, C, D. Then, B connected to E and F to form a triangle, C connected to G and H, D connected to I and J. Wait, but this graph is quite big. The automorphism group would need to permute the three triangles. If each triangle is identical, then the automorphism group could be S3, permuting the three triangles. But that's order 6. If the triangles are different, the group is trivial. So no.\n\nAlternatively, make each triangle have a different structure. But then no automorphisms. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is 9 edges. Let's think: suppose we have a graph with 6 vertices. The minimal connected graph with automorphism group order 3. If the graph has 6 vertices, a connected graph can have at minimum 5 edges (a tree). But maybe the graph has 6 vertices and 9 edges. Wait, 6 vertices can have up to 15 edges. Not sure. Let me think of a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges.\n\nAlternatively, think of the complete bipartite graph K3,3. Its automorphism group is order 72 ( (3!)(3!)2 ), which is much too big.\n\nAlternatively, consider a graph composed of two disjoint triangles connected by a single edge. Wait, but then the automorphism group can swap the triangles if they are connected symmetrically. For example, if the edge connects corresponding vertices in each triangle. Then the automorphism group might be order 6 (swap triangles and rotate). But again, order 6.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph with a 3-cycle and another 3-cycle connected such that each vertex in the first cycle is connected to a distinct vertex in the second cycle. That might have a larger automorphism group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph is the 3-sun graph, which is a triangle with each vertex connected to a pendant vertex. So 6 vertices total. The automorphism group here would be D3 (order 6), as each pendant is attached to a triangle vertex, and you can rotate the triangle, permuting the pendant vertices. So order 6.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of a graph that's more asymmetric but still has some rotational symmetry. Let me consider graphs on 4 vertices. For example, the diamond graph (K4 minus an edge) has automorphism group of order 4. The paw graph (a triangle with a pendant edge) has automorphism group of order 2. So 4 vertices won't work.\n\nWait, going back to the problem. The minimal number of edges e such that there exists a connected graph with e edges and automorphism group order 3. Let's try to construct such a graph.\n\nSuppose we take a graph with 4 vertices. The connected graphs on 4 vertices have up to 6 edges (complete graph). The possible automorphism groups for connected graphs on 4 vertices include S4, A4, D4, various smaller groups. But none of order 3. Because 3 doesn't divide 4! = 24 in a way that allows a subgroup of order 3. Wait, but 3 divides 24, so there could be a subgroup of order 3. For example, a cycle of three elements. But does any connected graph on 4 vertices have automorphism group of order 3?\n\nFor example, take the path graph with 4 vertices (P4). It has automorphism group order 2. The complete graph K4 has S4, order 24. The cycle graph C4 has automorphism group D4, order 8. The diamond graph (K4 missing one edge) has automorphism group of order 4. The paw graph has order 2. The star graph K1,3 has automorphism group S3, order 6. So no connected graph on 4 vertices has automorphism group order 3.\n\nHow about 5 vertices? Let's see. The possible automorphism groups of connected graphs on 5 vertices. For example, the cycle graph C5 has automorphism group D5, order 10. The complete graph K5 has S5, order 120. The star graph K1,4 has S4, order 24. Other graphs might have smaller automorphism groups.\n\nWait, but maybe a graph with 5 vertices and automorphism group of order 3. Let's see. Suppose we have a graph with 5 vertices where three of them form a triangle, and the other two are connected in a way that allows a cyclic permutation of the triangle. For example, let vertices A, B, C form a triangle, and vertices D and E connected to A and B respectively. Wait, not sure. Let me try to be more precise.\n\nSuppose vertices A, B, C form a triangle. Vertex D is connected to A, and vertex E is connected to B. What's the automorphism group here? Any automorphism must fix D and E since D is only connected to A, and E is only connected to B. So swapping A and B would require swapping D and E as well. If D and E are connected to different vertices, then the automorphism group may only allow swapping A and B if we also swap D and E. But if D and E have different connections, maybe not. For example, if D is connected only to A, and E is connected only to B, then an automorphism can swap A and B and swap D and E. But if D and E are otherwise different (like D has degree 1 and E has degree 1), then such a swap is allowed. Therefore, the automorphism group would have order 2, generated by swapping A<->B, D<->E. So that's order 2. Not 3.\n\nAlternatively, if we have three vertices in a triangle and two other vertices each connected to different vertices of the triangle. For example, D connected to A and E connected to B. Then, the automorphism group might still be order 2. If the connections are symmetric, maybe order 2. If the connections are asymmetric, trivial.\n\nAlternatively, create a graph where the triangle's automorphisms are restricted by the rest of the graph. Suppose we have a triangle A, B, C. Vertex D is connected to A and B. Vertex E is connected to B and C. Vertex F is connected to C and A. Then, the graph becomes a 3-dimensional structure. But now it's getting complex, and the automorphism group might be larger.\n\nAlternatively, take the triangle A, B, C and connect each to a distinct structure. For example, A connected to a leaf D, B connected to a leaf E, and C connected to a two-edge path F-G. Then, the automorphism group would have to fix C since it's the only one connected to a path of length 2. Then, A and B can be swapped if their leaves are also swapped. So automorphism group order 2. Still not 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a graph with 6 vertices. Let's try to think. Suppose we have two triangles connected by a bridge. For example, A-B-C-A and D-E-F-D, connected by an edge between C and D. Then, the automorphism group might allow swapping the two triangles if they are symmetric. But each triangle is connected to the bridge via a different node (C and D), so if the bridge is between C and D, then swapping the triangles would require swapping C and D, which might not form an automorphism since the rest of the connections are preserved. But this might lead to an automorphism group of order 2 (swapping the two triangles and their respective parts). Not 3.\n\nAlternatively, create a graph with a central node connected to three others, each forming a triangle with the central node. So, central node O connected to A, B, C. Then, O-A-B-O forms a triangle, O-B-C-O forms another, and O-C-A-O the third. Wait, but that would require multiple edges between O and each of A, B, C, which is not allowed in a simple graph. Alternatively, have O connected to A, B, C, and each pair among A, B, C forms a triangle. Then, A-B-C-A is a triangle, and each is connected to O. Then, the graph is K4 minus three edges (if O is connected to each). Wait, no, if O is connected to A, B, C and A, B, C form a triangle, then it's K4 minus the edges OA, OB, OC. Wait, no, that would not be a triangle. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph formed by three triangles sharing a common edge. So, the common edge is between two vertices, and each triangle shares this edge. Then, the automorphism group might allow rotation among the triangles. Hmm, but in a simple graph, you can't have multiple edges. So this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph with a 9-edge structure. Wait, but I need to find the minimal e. Let's think of the minimal connected graphs with cycles. The smallest possible e for a connected graph that's not a tree is one more edge than a tree. For example, a tree with n-1 edges, and one more edge makes a cycle. So for example, if we have a graph with 4 vertices, it's a tree (3 edges) plus one edge, making a cycle (4 edges total). So the smallest e where the graph has a cycle is n-1 +1 = n. So for 4 vertices, 4 edges.\n\nBut an n-vertex graph with cycles might have more automorphisms. For example, the cycle graph C4 has 4 vertices and 4 edges, automorphism group order 8. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the graph is a triangle with a path of length 2 attached to one vertex. So edges are triangle (3 edges) plus two more edges (total 5 edges). The automorphism group would fix the vertex with the path attached, leading to trivial or order 1 automorphism group. No.\n\nAlternatively, take a graph that is a triangle connected to another triangle via a single edge. So, two triangles connected by a bridge. Then, the automorphism group might swap the triangles if they are symmetric. The bridge is between two vertices, one from each triangle. So if the connection is symmetric, you can swap the triangles, leading to automorphism group of order 2. If not, trivial. So order 2.\n\nAnother approach: check known graphs with automorphism group order 3. From some graph theory knowledge, such graphs do exist. For example, the skeleton of the triangular prism has automorphism group order 12, but maybe a different graph.\n\nWait, I recall that the smallest graph with automorphism group of order 3 has 9 edges. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph formed by three copies of K2 connected to a central K1,3. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the graph called the \"cube-connected cycles,\" but I don't think that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of a graph with three vertices of degree 3 forming a triangle, each connected to two leaves. Wait, let's see: vertices A, B, C forming a triangle. Each connected to two leaves. So A connected to D and E, B connected to F and G, C connected to H and I. That's a lot of vertices. The automorphism group would need to permute the triangle's vertices and their attached leaves. But each vertex has two leaves, so swapping the leaves would contribute to the automorphism group. However, the automorphism group would be the wreath product of the triangle's automorphism group and the symmetries of the leaves. But each leaf pair is fixed to their respective nodes, so the automorphism group would be D3 (order 6), permuting the triangle vertices and swapping the leaves for each if possible. So order 6 again.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Maybe I should look for a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges. For example, take two triangles sharing a common vertex. So total vertices: 3 + 3 -1 = 5. Edges: 3 + 3 -0 = 6. The automorphism group would fix the common vertex and allow flipping the two triangles if they are symmetric. So automorphism group would be order 2 (swap the two triangles). Not 3.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph formed by a triangle with each vertex connected to a fourth vertex. So, the graph has 4 vertices: A, B, C forming a triangle, and D connected to A, B, C. So edges: AB, BC, CA, DA, DB, DC. Total edges: 6. This graph is K4 minus the three edges AD, BD, CD, but wait, no. Actually, it's a triangle plus a central vertex connected to all three. This graph is called the \"3-fold wheel\" or \"windmill graph\". Its automorphism group is S3 (order 6), because you can permute the outer triangle vertices freely while fixing the center. So that's order 6. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe if we have the center connected to only two vertices of the triangle. Then the automorphism group would be smaller. For example, center D connected to A and B but not C. Then, the automorphism group must fix C and swap A and B if possible. But since D is connected to A and B, an automorphism can swap A and B if it also swaps their connections. But since D is connected to both, that's allowed. So the automorphism group would be order 2. Still not 3.\n\nAnother idea: the graph must have an automorphism of order 3 (a permutation of the vertices that cycles three vertices and fixes others), and no other automorphisms. So maybe a graph with a 3-cycle and some additional edges that are arranged asymmetrically except for the 3-cycle symmetry.\n\nFor example, take a triangle A, B, C. Then, add three more vertices D, E, F. Connect D to A, E to B, and F to C. Now, each triangle vertex has a leaf. The automorphism group is D3 (order 6), as before. But if we add another edge, say, connect D to E. Now, the structure is more complex. The automorphism group might now be different. Let's see. If we rotate the triangle A->B->C->A, then D is connected to A, E to B, F to C. If we rotate, D moves to E, which is connected to B (now A). Wait, no, it's complicated. If there's an edge D-E, then rotating the triangle would require that edge to move to E-F or something else, which it's not. So maybe this graph's automorphism group is reduced.\n\nAlternatively, create a graph where three vertices form a triangle, and each has a unique connection to other parts of the graph. For example, vertex A is connected to D, B is connected to E and F, and C is connected to G. Such asymmetry would mean only rotations that preserve the unique connections are possible, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, take the triangle ABC and add edges AD, BE, CF, where D, E, F are distinct vertices. Then, if you rotate the triangle, D must go to E to F to D, but since these are distinct, the automorphism would have to cycle D, E, F as well. If these outer vertices form their own cycle or structure that allows this. For example, if D, E, F are connected in a cycle too, then rotating both cycles would give an automorphism. But then the automorphism group could be larger.\n\nAlternatively, connect D to E, E to F, F to D to form another triangle. Then, the entire graph has two triangles connected such that each vertex of the first triangle is connected to a vertex of the second triangle. So A-D, B-E, C-F. Then, the automorphism group could rotate both triangles simultaneously, leading to a cyclic group of order 3. If there are no other automorphisms, this would give order 3. Let me check.\n\nIn this case, the graph has two triangles connected by three edges (A-D, B-E, C-F). The total edges are 3 (first triangle) + 3 (second triangle) + 3 (connections) = 9 edges. Now, the automorphisms would include permutations that rotate both triangles simultaneously. For example, the permutation (A B C)(D E F) would map each vertex to the next in their respective triangles and preserve the connections (A-D becomes B-E, etc.). However, can there be other automorphisms? For example, flipping both triangles. If we apply a reflection to both triangles, swapping A and C, B and A (no, a reflection would swap A and C, B stays, etc.? Wait, a reflection in a triangle would be a permutation like (A C)(B). But in the second triangle D-E-F, applying (D F)(E). Then, the connections A-D, B-E, C-F would become C-F, B-E, A-D. So the edge C-F becomes A-D, but A-D is still an edge. So this permutation would preserve the graph structure. Therefore, the automorphism group includes these reflections as well, leading to an automorphism group of order 6 (rotations and reflections). So again, order 6. Not 3.\n\nSo maybe this approach isn't working. Let's consider the number of edges. The graph I described has 9 edges. If such a graph has automorphism group of order 6, but we need one of order 3, maybe there's a modification. Suppose we break the reflection symmetry. For example, in the second triangle D-E-F, add an extra edge to one vertex, making it asymmetric. Say, connect D to G. Now, the second triangle is no longer a triangle; it's D-E-F-D plus an edge D-G. Then, any automorphism must fix G, as it's only connected to D. Therefore, the reflection automorphism that swaps D and F would require moving G to F, but since G is only connected to D, that's impossible. Therefore, the only automorphisms are the rotations (A B C)(D E F) and possibly others, but with G fixed. Wait, but if G is only connected to D, then rotating D-E-F would require G to move to E or F, which it can't because they don't have a connection to G. Therefore, the automorphism group now is trivial for the second triangle. Thus, the only possible automorphism is rotating A-B-C and D-E-F simultaneously if possible. But since the second triangle is now not a pure triangle (it's a tetrahedron with an extra edge?), the rotation might not preserve the edges. This is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal such graph might indeed have 9 edges. If the answer is 9, but how to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 3, but no, because a triangle has automorphism group 6. So maybe the next possible. Let's think.\n\nIf I can't find a graph with e=9 edges, maybe the answer is 9. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 6. Let me think: take the graph with two triangles connected by three edges as described earlier. But wait, that was 9 edges. Alternatively, a graph with a 3-cycle and three leaves attached, which is 6 edges. But that's order 6.\n\nWait, another idea: the graph known as the \"3-prism\" which is two triangles connected by a 3-edge matching. That's called the triangular prism graph, which has 6 vertices and 9 edges. Its automorphism group is order 12. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, take the complete bipartite graph K3,3. It has 9 edges and automorphism group order 72. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a graph with 6 vertices and 6 edges. For example, the graph formed by a triangle and three leaves attached to one vertex. That's 3 + 3 = 6 edges. The automorphism group is D3 (order 6), which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, a different graph with 6 edges. For example, the cube's skeleton has 12 edges, but that's too much.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 9. Because the triangular prism graph has 9 edges and automorphism group order 12, but if we modify it by adding or removing edges to reduce the automorphism group to 3. Suppose we take the triangular prism and add an edge that breaks some symmetries. For example, connect one vertex from the first triangle to a non-corresponding vertex in the second triangle. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, start with a graph where the automorphism group is cyclic of order 3. For example, a graph with a 3-cycle and some additional edges that are arranged such that rotation by 120 degrees preserves the graph, but reflections do not. For example, a graph with a triangle and each vertex connected to a fourth vertex in a cyclic manner. Wait, but that would create a K4, which has a larger automorphism group.\n\nAlternatively, consider a graph with 7 vertices: a triangle connected to a 4-cycle in a specific way. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the graph as having three \"arms\" arranged in a cyclic manner. If each arm is connected such that rotating them preserves the graph but reflecting doesn't. For example, each arm could be a path of different lengths. Wait, but then the automorphism group would be trivial.\n\nI'm starting to think that the minimal number of edges e is 9. Because the triangular prism graph has 9 edges and automorphism group of order 12, but perhaps another graph with 9 edges has group order 3. Alternatively, maybe there's a graph with 6 edges and automorphism group order 3. But I haven't been able to construct one.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph with vertices labeled 0 to 5, edges forming two disjoint triangles: 0-1-2-0 and 3-4-5-3, plus edges 0-3, 1-4, 2-5. This is the bipartite graph K3,3, which has automorphism group order 72. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, connect the triangles with a single edge. So, edges of two triangles plus one connecting edge. This graph has 3+3+1=7 edges. The automorphism group might swap the triangles if the connecting edge is symmetric. For example, connecting a vertex from each triangle. If the connection is between vertex 0 of the first triangle and vertex 3 of the second, then automorphisms could swap the triangles if the graphs are symmetric. But since the connection is between specific vertices, swapping would require the connecting edge to be preserved. This might lead to an automorphism group of order 2 (swap the triangles and adjust the connector edge). Or trivial if not symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, connect each vertex of the first triangle to a unique vertex in the second. For example, 0-3, 1-4, 2-5. That's the K3,3 graph again.\n\nAlternatively, make the connections asymmetric. For example, 0 connected to 3, 1 connected to 4, and 2 connected to 4. Now, the second triangle has vertex 4 with two edges. This would break symmetry. The automorphism group might now be order 2 or 1.\n\nI'm not making progress. Let me think of known results. The automorphism group of a graph must be non-trivial. The smallest non-trivial groups are order 2, 3, etc. It's known that there exist graphs with automorphism groups of any given order, but constructing them is another matter.\n\nAccording to some references, the smallest graph with automorphism group order 3 has 9 vertices. For example, the graph is the Frucht graph but with modifications. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 9 edges.\n\nWait, think of the graph where each vertex is in a position that can be rotated but not reflected. For example, a graph consisting of three triangles arranged in a cycle. Each triangle is connected to the next in a cycle. Such a graph might have rotational symmetry of order 3 but no reflections. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph formed by a 9-edge graph that is the disjoint union of three triangles. But the graph must be connected. So three triangles connected in a line. For example, triangle A connected to triangle B via an edge, and triangle B connected to triangle C via an edge. Then, the automorphism group might allow swapping the end triangles, giving order 2. But not 3.\n\nAlternatively, connect them in a cycle. Three triangles connected in a cycle. Each triangle connected to the next by an edge. Then, the automorphism group allows rotation of the three triangles, leading to order 3. But in this case, the total edges would be 3*3 +3=12 edges. Too many.\n\nAlternatively, take a triangle and add an edge from each vertex to a new vertex. So, central vertex D connected to A, B, C. Then, the graph has edges AB, BC, CA, DA, DB, DC (6 edges). The automorphism group is S3, order 6. Still too big.\n\nAlternatively, take a triangle and add a fourth vertex connected to A and B. Then, edges AB, BC, CA, DA, DB. This graph has automorphism group order 2 (swap A and B if possible). Because if D is connected to A and B, then swapping A and B would preserve the graph, but flipping the triangle would require swapping C as well, which is connected to both A and B. Wait, if A and B are swapped, then C remains connected to both, so the triangle is preserved. So the automorphism group here would consist of swapping A and B, and swapping D accordingly. But D is only connected to A and B, so swapping A and B would swap D's connections. But D is a vertex; swapping A and B would swap their edges to D. So the automorphism here is the transposition (A B) which swaps A and B, and swaps their connections to D and leaves C alone. However, this transposition must also preserve the edge CA, which becomes CB, which is still present. Similarly, edge CB becomes CA. So yes, swapping A and B would preserve the graph. So the automorphism group here is of order 2. Hence, this graph has automorphism group of order 2. Still not 3.\n\nAnother approach: look for a graph with 9 edges and automorphism group order 3. If such a graph exists, then the answer is 9. Otherwise, higher.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is 3 edges. But a triangle has 3 edges and automorphism group of order 6. So no.\n\nAfter spending considerable time and not finding a graph with fewer edges, perhaps the minimal e is 9. I'm not entirely sure, but given the options and the difficulty in constructing a graph with automorphism group order 3 with fewer edges, it's possible that the answer is 9.",
