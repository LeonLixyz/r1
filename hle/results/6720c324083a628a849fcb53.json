  "question": "Let $\\Sigma_g$ denote the oriented closed surface of genus $g$. Compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I need to compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, specifically \u03a3\u2083\u2081 \u00d7 \u03a3\u2081\u2087. Hmm, let me recall what simplicial volume is. From what I remember, the simplicial volume of a manifold is a topological invariant that measures, in some sense, the \"complexity\" of the manifold. It's denoted by ||M|| and is defined using the \u2113\u00b9 norm of the fundamental class in homology. \n\nNow, simplicial volume has some properties. For example, if a manifold is hyperbolic, its simplicial volume is proportional to its volume. But in this case, we're dealing with the product of two surfaces of genus g. Wait, each \u03a3_g is an orientable closed surface. For a surface of genus g \u2265 1, its simplicial volume is known. Specifically, for a hyperbolic surface (genus \u22652), the simplicial volume is 4g \u22124. Wait, let me check that. Actually, the simplicial volume of a surface \u03a3_g with genus g \u2265 2 is 4(g\u22121). Because when g=1, which is the torus, the simplicial volume is zero since it's an amenable manifold. So for genus 31 and 17, both are greater than 2, right? So \u03a3\u2083\u2081 has simplicial volume 4*(31-1)=4*30=120, and \u03a3\u2081\u2087 is 4*(17-1)=4*16=64. \n\nBut the question is about the product manifold \u03a3\u2083\u2081 \u00d7 \u03a3\u2081\u2087. So what's the simplicial volume of a product manifold? I think there's a general result here. Wait, I remember that the simplicial volume is multiplicative under products under certain conditions. Let me recall. If the fundamental groups of the two manifolds satisfy some condition related to being Gromov's \"fundamental groups of nonpositively curved manifolds\" or something like that. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula when the simplicial volumes of both factors are positive. \n\nWait, in the case where both manifolds have positive simplicial volume, then the simplicial volume of their product is the product of their simplicial volumes. Wait, but I might be mixing things up. Or maybe there's a different behavior. Let me think. For example, the simplicial volume of the product S \u00d7 S' is not necessarily the product of their simplicial volumes. But in some cases, maybe when they are hyperbolic? Wait, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the simplicial volume of the product is zero if at least one of the factors has zero simplicial volume. For instance, the torus (genus 1) has simplicial volume zero, so the product of two tori (which is a 4-manifold) would have simplicial volume zero. But in our case, both \u03a3\u2083\u2081 and \u03a3\u2081\u2087 have positive simplicial volumes. Wait, so then what? \n\nI need to recall the exact theorem. From Gromov's work, the simplicial volume of a product M \u00d7 N satisfies ||M \u00d7 N|| \u2265 ||M|| \u00d7 ||N||. But is it equal? Or is there a different relation? There's a formula involving the Euler characteristic for surfaces. Wait, but maybe the simplicial volume of the product is zero here. Why? Because when you take the product of two surfaces of genus \u22652, the resulting 4-manifold might have some properties that make the simplicial volume zero. Wait, but why would that be?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplicial volume is multiplicative for certain classes of manifolds. For example, in the case of hyperbolic manifolds. But a product of two hyperbolic surfaces (each of dimension 2) is a 4-manifold which is not hyperbolic, because hyperbolic manifolds have constant negative sectional curvature, but the product would have a metric with sectional curvature both negative and zero (since the product metric would have curvatures in each factor). So the product isn't a hyperbolic manifold. Therefore, maybe the simplicial volume isn't just the product. \n\nWait, but there is a formula. Let me check. According to some references, the simplicial volume of a product M \u00d7 N is at least the product of the simplicial volumes of M and N. However, in many cases, it can be larger. Wait, but that's just a lower bound. For example, the simplicial volume of S \u00d7 S' where S and S' are hyperbolic surfaces would be at least (4g-4)(4g'-4). But is this actually the case?\n\nWait, but there's a conjecture or theorem that if M and N are closed oriented manifolds of positive simplicial volume, then the simplicial volume of the product is zero if either M or N has zero simplicial volume. But in our case, both have positive. Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. The product of two manifolds with positive simplicial volume might have zero simplicial volume. For example, if the fundamental group of one is amenable, then the product has zero simplicial volume. Wait, but in our case, the surfaces \u03a3_g for g \u22652 have fundamental groups that are non-amenable. Because the fundamental group of a hyperbolic surface is a non-elementary hyperbolic group, hence non-amenable. Therefore, their product would have a fundamental group which is the product of two non-amenable groups. \n\nBut does the product of two non-amenable groups have any properties that affect the simplicial volume? Wait, simplicial volume is related to the classifying space for bounded cohomology. If both M and N have positive simplicial volume, then perhaps their product does as well. But is there a known formula?\n\nWait, perhaps the simplicial volume of the product is actually zero here. Let me think about specific cases. For instance, what's the simplicial volume of \u03a3_g \u00d7 \u03a3_h, where g,h \u22652. I've heard in some contexts that products of hyperbolic manifolds can have zero simplicial volume. For example, in dimension 4, if a manifold is a product of two surfaces, each of genus \u22652, then its simplicial volume is zero. But why?\n\nWait, here's a possible line of reasoning. The simplicial volume is related to the existence of a nonpositively curved metric. For a product of hyperbolic surfaces, the product metric is nonpositively curved (since each factor is hyperbolic, hence has curvature -1). However, in higher dimensions, nonpositive curvature does not necessarily guarantee positive simplicial volume. Wait, but in dimension 2, hyperbolic surfaces have positive simplicial volume. In dimension 3, hyperbolic 3-manifolds also have positive simplicial volume. But in higher dimensions, even some nonpositively curved manifolds can have zero simplicial volume. For example, products might have zero simplicial volume because their fundamental groups are not \"sufficiently hyperbolic\".\n\nAlternatively, the simplicial volume could be non-zero. Let me check. If M and N are aspherical with non-amenable fundamental groups, then their product is also aspherical, and the fundamental group is the product of two non-amenable groups. Then, by a result of Gromov, if the fundamental group of a manifold M has a center or satisfies certain properties, then the simplicial volume vanishes. But the product of two surface groups is a centerless group, as each surface group is centerless. Hmm, not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplicial volume of the product is the product of the simplicial volumes. So in this case, 120 * 64 = 7680. But is there a theorem that states this?\n\nWait, let me recall. The simplicial volume is multiplicative under products in certain cases. For example, in the case of hyperbolic manifolds in even dimensions? Wait, but the product of two hyperbolic 2-manifolds is a 4-manifold. But hyperbolic 4-manifolds are different from products. Alternatively, there's a formula called the Gromov norm. Wait, according to some sources, the simplicial volume of a product M \u00d7 N is bounded below by the product of the simplicial volumes of M and N. But it's not known in general whether equality holds. However, for certain cases, like when M and N are hyperbolic, maybe. Wait, but the product of hyperbolic manifolds is not hyperbolic. So maybe even if the lower bound is positive, the actual simplicial volume could be higher or not?\n\nWait, but in the specific case of 4-manifolds that are products of two hyperbolic surfaces, I've heard that the simplicial volume is zero. How is that possible? Let me think. If the fundamental group is a product of two surface groups, which are both non-amenable, but maybe the product is still somehow amenable in a different sense? Wait, no. The product of two non-amenable groups is non-amenable. Because a group is amenable if it has an invariant mean, and the product of two non-amenable groups shouldn't be amenable. Therefore, the fundamental group of \u03a3_g \u00d7 \u03a3_h is non-amenable. However, amenability of the fundamental group is a sufficient condition for the simplicial volume to be zero, but not a necessary condition. So even if the fundamental group is non-amenable, the simplicial volume could be zero or positive.\n\nBut according to some theorems, for example, if a manifold is aspherical and its fundamental group is non-amenable, then does the simplicial volume have to be positive? Not necessarily. There are examples where the fundamental group is non-amenable but the simplicial volume is zero. For example, certain manifolds with circle actions, but that's a different story.\n\nAlternatively, I might recall that the simplicial volume of a product manifold M \u00d7 N is zero if either M or N has zero simplicial volume. But in our case, both are positive. So maybe the product has positive simplicial volume. But then how much?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in even dimensions higher than 2, there are no known examples of closed manifolds with positive simplicial volume except those that are locally symmetric of non-compact type. Wait, but products of hyperbolic surfaces are not locally symmetric spaces. Wait, actually, the product of two hyperbolic surfaces is a locally symmetric space. Because SL(2,R) \u00d7 SL(2,R) is a Lie group, and the product of two hyperbolic planes is a symmetric space. So perhaps the simplicial volume of such a space is positive. But then, is there a formula for it?\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic of \u03a3_g \u00d7 \u03a3_h is the product of the Euler characteristics, which is (2\u22122g)(2\u22122h). For our case, genus 31 and 17, that's (2\u221262)(2\u221234) = (-60)(-32) = 1920. But how does the Euler characteristic relate to simplicial volume? For surfaces, the simplicial volume is proportional to the Euler characteristic: ||\u03a3_g|| = 4(g\u22121) = 2|\u03c7(\u03a3_g)|. So for the product, maybe the simplicial volume relates to the Euler characteristic in some way? But in higher dimensions, I'm not sure. For 4-manifolds, the Euler characteristic can be written in terms of the Pontryagin numbers, but simplicial volume is a different invariant.\n\nAlternatively, let me check a reference in my mind. In the paper \"Simplicial volume of products and fiber bundles\" by C. L\u00f6h and R. Sauer, they show that the simplicial volume of a product M \u00d7 N is bounded below by the product of the simplicial volumes of M and N if both M and N have positive simplicial volume. Moreover, in some cases, such as when both M and N are hyperbolic, the simplicial volume of the product is equal to the product of the simplicial volumes. Wait, but hyperbolic manifolds are in any dimension? For instance, a product of two hyperbolic surfaces is a higher-dimensional locally symmetric space, and perhaps its simplicial volume can be computed.\n\nWait, but in the case of a product of two hyperbolic surfaces, is the simplicial volume equal to the product of the individual simplicial volumes? If so, then the answer here would be 120 * 64 = 7680. However, if this is not the case, maybe it's zero. \n\nBut wait, another angle: the simplicial volume is related to the volume in the case of hyperbolic manifolds. For hyperbolic n-manifolds, ||M|| = vol(M)/v_n, where v_n is the volume of the regular ideal simplex in hyperbolic n-space. For surfaces, v_2 is the maximal area of an ideal triangle, which is \u03c0. So for a hyperbolic surface, vol(M) = -2\u03c0\u03c7(M) = 2\u03c0(2g - 2). Then ||M|| = 4g -4, which matches the formula. For a product of two hyperbolic surfaces, the volume would be the product of their volumes. However, in higher dimensions, the simplicial volume of a hyperbolic n-manifold is vol(M)/v_n. But for a product manifold, which is not hyperbolic, this formula doesn't apply directly. \n\nBut if the product is a locally symmetric space of non-compact type, perhaps we can compute its simplicial volume. For example, if G is a semisimple Lie group and K a maximal compact subgroup, then the simplicial volume of the locally symmetric space \u0393\\G/K is equal to the volume divided by the maximal straightening constant or something. But I'm not sure. In any case, the product of two hyperbolic surfaces is a locally symmetric space for the group SL(2,R) \u00d7 SL(2,R). The simplicial volume for such spaces might be known.\n\nBut perhaps there is a more straightforward answer. Since \u03a3_g \u00d7 \u03a3_h is a 4-manifold, and in dimensions \u22653, simplicial volume can be more complicated. Wait, but according to some sources, the simplicial volume of the product of two hyperbolic surfaces is zero. For example, in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3990, they might discuss such products.\n\nAlternatively, recalling a theorem: the simplicial volume of M \u00d7 N vanishes if the fundamental group of M \u00d7 N is not Gromov hyperbolic. Since the product of two hyperbolic groups (in the geometric group theory sense) is not hyperbolic, because it contains a subgroup isomorphic to Z \u00d7 Z (from the product of two closed surface groups, which are hyperbolic). So if the fundamental group is not Gromov hyperbolic, then maybe the simplicial volume vanishes. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the product of two hyperbolic manifolds is not a manifold of non-positive curvature (since it's a product of negative and negative curvatures?), but actually, in product metrics, the curvature is non-positive. Wait, in a product of two hyperbolic surfaces, each with curvature -1, the product metric would have sectional curvature -1 in the planes tangent to each factor and zero in mixed planes. So the manifold is non-positively curved. However, such a manifold may have higher rank in the sense of geometry, which might imply that its simplicial volume is zero. \n\nWait, a theorem by Brian Bowditch and others says that higher rank locally symmetric spaces have zero simplicial volume. The product of two hyperbolic surfaces is a higher rank locally symmetric space (since each SL(2,R) is rank 1, but the product is rank 2). Therefore, such a space would have zero simplicial volume. Hence, \u03a3\u2083\u2081 \u00d7 \u03a3\u2081\u2087 would have simplicial volume zero. \n\nThat seems plausible. Let me verify. If the manifold is a higher rank locally symmetric space, then it has zero simplicial volume. Yes, I think that's a known result. For example, products of hyperbolic manifolds (each of rank 1) would form a higher rank space, hence simplicial volume zero. Therefore, the answer here is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together: Each \u03a3_g for g \u22652 has positive simplicial volume, but when you take their product, which is a higher rank locally symmetric space, the simplicial volume vanishes. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n",
