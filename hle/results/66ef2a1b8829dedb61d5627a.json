  "question": "What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking which protein, when broken down, allows macrophages to engulf amyloid. Hmm, I need to recall some biology here. Amyloid is involved in diseases like Alzheimer's, right? The process of macrophages engulfing things is phagocytosis. I remember that there's a protein that normally inhibits phagocytosis of amyloid plaques.\n\nWait, I think CD47 is a \"don't eat me\" signal on cells. When cells have CD47, it binds to SIRP\u03b1 on macrophages, preventing them from being engulfed. So if CD47 is broken down or blocked, maybe macrophages can then attack those cells. But does this relate to amyloid?\n\nOh right! In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta plaques accumulate. Studies have shown that CD47 is present on these plaques. If CD47 is inhibited or broken down, macrophages can recognize and engulf the amyloid plaques more effectively. So the answer here would be CD47. Let me double-check. So breaking down CD47 would remove the signal that tells macrophages not to eat the amyloid, allowing them to engulf it. Yep, that makes sense. I'm pretty confident about this, but maybe around 90% sure because I'm not 100% certain if there's another protein involved in this specific pathway.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: CD47 is a cell surface protein that acts as a \"don't eat me\" signal by binding to macrophage receptor SIRP\u03b1, inhibiting phagocytosis. In amyloid-related diseases like Alzheimer's, amyloid-beta plaques express CD47, which protects them from macrophage clearance. Breaking down CD47 removes this inhibitory signal, enabling macrophages to engulf the amyloid deposits. This mechanism is supported by research linking CD47 blockade to increased amyloid clearance.\n\nAnswer: CD47  \nConfidence: 90%",
