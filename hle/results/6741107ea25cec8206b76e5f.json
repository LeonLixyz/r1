  "question": "Find the smallest positive integer k such that $k^4-2k^3-k^2 +2k$ is divisible by  9, 10, 36, and 72, and the sum of digits of k in its decimal representation is a prime number and the prime number y such that $y^3-14y^2+59y -70=0$",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the smallest positive integer k that meets several conditions. Let me break down each condition and figure out how to approach them one by one.\n\nFirst, the main conditions are:\n\n1. k\u2074 - 2k\u00b3 - k\u00b2 + 2k must be divisible by 9, 10, 36, and 72.\n2. The sum of the digits of k in its decimal representation must be a prime number.\n3. Find the prime number y that satisfies the equation y\u00b3 - 14y\u00b2 + 59y -70 = 0.\n\nStarting with the third condition might actually help because once we find y, that could influence the other parts. Let me look at the equation y\u00b3 - 14y\u00b2 + 59y -70 = 0. Since y is a prime number, I can test small primes here.\n\nLet's try y=2: 8 - 56 + 118 -70 = (8-56) = -48, then -48 +118 = 70, 70-70=0. Oh, so y=2 is a root. Let me confirm that. Plugging in 2, indeed 8 -56 +118 -70 = 0. So y=2 is a solution. Now, let's factor the polynomial using this root. If we factor out (y - 2), we can use polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDividing y\u00b3 -14y\u00b2 +59y -70 by (y - 2):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  -14   59  -70\n          2  -24   70\n        ----------------\n          1  -12   35    0\n\nSo the quadratic factor is y\u00b2 -12y +35. Let's factor that: looking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. Those are -5 and -7. So, (y -5)(y -7). Therefore, the roots are y=2, y=5, y=7. All of these are primes. Wait, but the question says \"the prime number y\", so there are three primes here. But maybe the question is referring to a specific one related to k? Or perhaps the answer is the prime y, which could be any of these, but maybe the problem expects all of them? Wait, looking back at the original question: \"the prime number y such that...\" So the equation has three roots, which are 2, 5, 7. All three are primes. Hmm. But the way the question is phrased: \"the prime number y such that...\" So maybe the answer expects all such primes. However, in the response format, it says \"the prime number y\", which is singular. Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe original question says: \"Find the smallest positive integer k such that [...] and the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y such that y\u00b3 -14y\u00b2 +59y -70=0.\"\n\nWait, the structure here is a bit confusing. Let me parse the sentence again. The user is asking to find two things: the smallest positive integer k that meets the divisibility and sum of digits conditions, and also to find the prime number y that satisfies the given cubic equation. So it's two separate things to find: k and y. The answer format should have both. But in the problem, the sum of digits of k has to be a prime number, which is different from y. So the answer is k and y. But looking at the response format, it's just \"your chosen answer\", which might imply combining both? Wait, the user says: \"the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". So the question is to find k and y. But the way the problem is written, the user might have intended that the sum of digits of k is equal to the prime y? Wait, maybe I misread that part. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal question: \"the sum of digits of k in its decimal representation is a prime number and the prime number y such that [...]\". The wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean two separate conditions: sum of digits is a prime (any prime) and then find y which is the prime satisfying the equation. Alternatively, it could mean that the sum of digits is equal to the prime y which is the solution to the equation. But given the structure, it's more likely that these are two separate parts. So first, find k such that:\n\n1. k's polynomial expression is divisible by 9,10,36,72.\n2. The sum of digits of k is a prime number.\n3. Find the prime y that solves the equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be k and y, where k meets the first two conditions, and y is the prime from the equation. However, since the problem mentions \"the prime number y\", which is from the equation, and the sum of digits is a prime (which may not be the same as y). So the answer will have two components: the value of k and the value(s) of y. Wait, but in the problem statement, maybe they are separate. Let me confirm the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Find the smallest positive integer k such that [divisibility conditions], and the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y such that [...]\". So it's a bit ambiguous. But perhaps it's two separate tasks: find k meeting the first two conditions, and also find the prime y from the equation. So the answer will include both k and y.\n\nBut given the answer format, which says \"Answer: {your chosen answer}\", it's possible that the answer requires k and y. However, in the problem statement, since the initial part is about k, and then they mention \"the prime number y\", maybe the answer is k and the primes y. But given the equation has three prime solutions, 2,5,7, which are all primes, so perhaps the answer for y is 2,5,7, but since the problem says \"the prime number y\", maybe it's expecting all three. However, maybe there's a typo and the equation is supposed to have a single prime solution, but in reality, it has three. Let me check the cubic equation again. The roots are 2,5,7. All primes. So maybe the answer for y is 2,5,7.\n\nBut the problem says \"the prime number y\", which is singular, but the equation has three solutions. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the user made an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as: find k such that (conditions) and the sum of digits is a prime, and also find the prime y from the equation. So the answer would have k and the primes y. But given that the problem is presented as a single question, it's possible that the answer is k and y, with y being 2,5,7. However, given that the response format is Answer: {your chosen answer}, perhaps we need to list all possible primes for y and the correct k. But maybe the problem expects that the sum of digits of k is equal to one of the primes y. But that's not necessarily stated. The problem says \"the sum of digits [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". So the \"and\" connects two separate things: finding k with the divisibility and digit sum prime, and finding y which is the prime solution to the equation. So the answer is two parts: k and y=2,5,7.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting to select one y that is linked to k. But perhaps not. Given the way the problem is written, I think the answer requires k and the primes y=2,5,7.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, solve for y in the equation y\u00b3 -14y\u00b2 +59y -70=0.\n\nAs previously, we found the roots are 2,5,7. All primes. So the primes y are 2,5,7. So that part is clear.\n\nNow, moving on to the main part: finding the smallest positive integer k such that:\n\n1. k\u2074 -2k\u00b3 -k\u00b2 +2k is divisible by 9,10,36,72. However, note that 9,10,36,72. But 36 is 4*9, 72 is 8*9. Wait, but 9,10,36,72. To be divisible by all of them, the number must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Let's compute LCM(9,10,36,72).\n\nFirst, factor each:\n\n9 = 3\u00b2\n\n10 = 2 * 5\n\n36 = 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2\n\n72 = 2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2\n\nThus, LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2 * 5 = 8 *9 *5= 360.\n\nTherefore, k\u2074 -2k\u00b3 -k\u00b2 +2k must be divisible by 360.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the smallest k where the polynomial evaluated at k is divisible by 360, and the sum of digits of k is a prime number (which can be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., but since k is a positive integer, and we're looking for the smallest, the sum might be a small prime like 2, 3, 5, 7).\n\nSo our first task is to find the smallest k where P(k) = k\u2074 -2k\u00b3 -k\u00b2 +2k \u2261 0 mod 360, and sum of digits of k is prime.\n\nLet me factor P(k) perhaps. Let's see:\n\nP(k) = k^4 -2k\u00b3 -k\u00b2 +2k\n\nFactor out k:\n\nk(k\u00b3 - 2k\u00b2 -k + 2)\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic polynomial: k\u00b3 -2k\u00b2 -k +2.\n\nTry rational roots. Possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12.\n\nTest k=1: 1 -2 -1 +2 =0. So (k -1) is a factor.\n\nDivide the cubic by (k -1):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n1 | 1  -2  -1  2\n\n          1  -1  -2\n\n        ----------------\n\n          1  -1  -2  0\n\nSo the cubic factors as (k -1)(k\u00b2 -k -2).\n\nFactor the quadratic: k\u00b2 -k -2 = (k -2)(k +1). So overall, P(k) factors as:\n\nk(k -1)(k -2)(k +1)\n\nTherefore, P(k) = k(k -1)(k -2)(k +1) = (k-2)(k-1)k(k+1)\n\nWait, that's four consecutive integers multiplied together? Let me see: (k-2)(k-1)k(k+1). This is the product of four consecutive integers starting from (k-2). For example, if k=3, then 1*2*3*4=24.\n\nBut in general, the product of four consecutive integers is divisible by 4! = 24. But since we need divisibility by 360 = 8 * 9 *5, so 360 = 2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2 *5. Let's see what factors we can get from the product of four consecutive integers.\n\nThe product of four consecutive numbers is divisible by 4! = 24, but may have higher divisibility. Let's check:\n\nIn the product of four consecutive integers, there are two even numbers, one of which is divisible by 4, so 2*4=8, which gives 2\u00b3. There is at least one multiple of 3, maybe two if the numbers include a multiple of 3 and another multiple due to consecutive numbers. For example, in numbers 3,4,5,6: includes 3 and 6 (two multiples of 3). Similarly, 2,3,4,5 includes 3, but not two. So depending on the four numbers, the number of 3s can vary.\n\nAdditionally, to get divisibility by 5, one of the four numbers must be divisible by 5. So, to have P(k) divisible by 360=2\u00b3*3\u00b2*5, the product must have:\n\n- At least three factors of 2 (which it does, since in four consecutive numbers, there are two even numbers, one divisible by 4 (giving three 2s: 4=2\u00b2, and another even number gives 2\u00b9, total 2\u00b3)).\n\n- At least two factors of 3. Since the product of four consecutive numbers includes at least one multiple of 3, but to get two, the four numbers must include two multiples of 3. For example, if the numbers include 3 and 6, then 3 divides both, giving two factors of 3. This happens when k-2, k-1, k, k+1 include two multiples of 3. That would happen when the four numbers span a range that includes two multiples of 3. For example, if k-2 \u22610 mod3 and k+1 \u22610 mod3, but that would mean k\u22612 mod3 and k\u22612 mod3, which might not. Alternatively, if k-1 \u22610 mod3 and k+1 \u22610 mod3, which would require k\u22611 mod3 and k\u22612 mod3, which is impossible. Wait, perhaps it's better to check specific k values.\n\nAlternatively, since four consecutive numbers will include one number \u22610 mod3 and another \u22611, 2, etc. Wait, let's think: In any four consecutive integers, there must be exactly one or two multiples of 3. For example, the numbers 1,2,3,4: 3 is a multiple. 3,4,5,6: 3 and 6. So in cases where the four numbers include two multiples of 3, the total exponent of 3 will be 2. Otherwise, if only one multiple of 3, then exponent is 1. Since we need exponent 2 (3\u00b2), so P(k) must include two multiples of 3, meaning that the four consecutive numbers must include two multiples of 3. That happens when one of the numbers is a multiple of 3 and another is a multiple of 3 as well. The only way this happens is if the four numbers include 3n and 3(n+1), which are two apart. For example, numbers 3,4,5,6: 3 and 6. So the four numbers must span a multiple of 3 and the next multiple of 3. So the four numbers must include two multiples of 3, which requires that the length of the four numbers covers two multiples of 3. Since they are consecutive, the distance between two multiples of 3 is 3, so four consecutive numbers can include two multiples of 3 if they are in a range of 5 numbers. Wait, no. For four consecutive numbers, the maximum gap between the first and last is 3. For example, n, n+1, n+2, n+3. If n \u22610 mod3, then the numbers are 0,1,2,3 mod3: includes 0 and 3 mod3, which are both multiples of 3. So if n \u22610 mod3, then n and n+3 are multiples of 3, but n+3 is outside the four consecutive numbers (since the numbers are n, n+1, n+2, n+3). Wait, n+3 is included. So the four numbers would be 3k, 3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3. Here, 3k and 3k+3 are multiples of 3. So in this case, the four consecutive numbers include two multiples of 3, hence providing two factors of 3. Therefore, if the four numbers start at n \u22610 mod3, then they include two multiples of 3. Similarly, if they start at n \u22611 mod3: n=3k+1, then the numbers are 3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3, 3k+4. Here, 3k+3 is a multiple of 3, so only one multiple. Similarly, starting at n=3k+2: 3k+2, 3k+3, 3k+4, 3k+5: again only one multiple (3k+3). Therefore, the product will have two factors of 3 only when the four consecutive numbers start at a multiple of 3, i.e., when n \u22610 mod3. Therefore, k-2 \u22610 mod3, which means k \u22612 mod3. Wait, because the four numbers are (k-2), (k-1), k, (k+1). If k-2 \u22610 mod3, then k \u22612 mod3, and the four numbers include k-2=3m and k+1=3m+3=3(m+1), so both 3m and 3(m+1), which are multiples of 3. Therefore, in this case, the product will have two factors of 3. Therefore, to get 3\u00b2 in the product, we need k \u22612 mod3.\n\nAdditionally, the product must be divisible by 5. For that, one of the four consecutive numbers must be divisible by 5. So, either (k-2), (k-1), k, or (k+1) \u22610 mod5. Therefore, k \u22612, 1, 0, or 4 mod5. So k \u22610,1,2,4 mod5.\n\nAlso, the product must be divisible by 8 (since LCM includes 2\u00b3). Since the product of four consecutive numbers, which includes two even numbers, one of which is divisible by 4, so 2*4=8, hence the product is divisible by 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, P(k) is divisible by 360 if:\n\n1. k \u22612 mod3 (to have two factors of 3)\n2. One of the four numbers (k-2, k-1, k, k+1) is divisible by 5 (so k \u22610,1,2,4 mod5)\n3. The product is divisible by 8, which is always true for four consecutive numbers.\n\nTherefore, the conditions reduce to:\n\nk \u22612 mod3\n\nand\n\nk \u22610,1,2,4 mod5\n\nAdditionally, we need sum of digits of k is a prime number. We need the smallest such k.\n\nSo, let's find the smallest k that satisfies:\n\nk \u22612 mod3\n\nand\n\nk \u22610,1,2,4 mod5\n\nand the sum of digits of k is prime.\n\nWe can approach this by checking k starting from the smallest possible and checking the conditions.\n\nFirst, note that k must be at least 2, since for k=1, the product is (1-2)(1-1)(1)(1+1) = (-1)(0)(1)(2)=0, which is divisible by everything, but sum of digits of k=1 is 1, which is not prime. Wait, k=1: P(k)=0, which is divisible by any number, including 360. But sum of digits is 1, not prime. So k=1 is invalid.\n\nk=2: P(2) = (0)(1)(2)(3)=0. Divisible by everything. Sum of digits is 2, which is prime. So k=2? But wait, check the congruence conditions. k=2:\n\nk \u22612 mod3? Yes, 2 mod3.\n\nk=2 mod5? 2 mod5 is allowed (since k can be 0,1,2,4 mod5). So yes. Therefore, k=2 meets the congruence conditions. Sum of digits is 2, which is prime. Therefore, k=2 seems to satisfy all conditions. However, wait, the problem says \"smallest positive integer k such that [...]\". So is k=2 the answer? Let me verify all conditions.\n\nFirst, P(2)=0, which is divisible by 360. Yes. Sum of digits is 2, prime. Prime y from equation is 2,5,7. Wait, but the answer requires k and y. But as per the problem statement, is there a connection between y and k? The problem says \"the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". So the sum of digits is a prime (which for k=2 is 2), and y is 2,5,7. But since the answer format is singular, maybe the problem expects to mention all primes y, but the user instruction says \"the prime number y\", which is plural. However, in the answer format, it's a single answer, so perhaps I should list all three primes. But the way the problem is written, maybe the answer is k=2 and the primes are 2,5,7. However, let's not jump to conclusions yet. Let's check k=2.\n\nBut wait, the polynomial P(k) for k=2 is zero, which is divisible by any number, so it's divisible by 360. Sum of digits is 2, which is prime. So k=2 satisfies all the conditions. Is there a smaller k? k=1: sum of digits is 1, not prime. k=2 is the first. So maybe k=2 is the answer. But wait, let's confirm whether the problem allows k=2. Is there any catch here?\n\nWait, the problem says \"smallest positive integer k such that [...]\". So yes, k=2 is positive and the smallest. So maybe the answer is k=2 and the primes y=2,5,7. But the answer format just says \"Answer: {your chosen answer}\". How should it be structured? Probably k and y. But the problem mentions \"the prime number y such that...\", but there are three primes. So the answer should include k=2 and the primes 2,5,7. But the user's instruction says to output the answer in the given format. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Find the smallest positive integer k such that [conditions], and the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y such that [...]\".\n\nThe structure is a bit ambiguous. It could be that the user is asking for two separate things: find k that meets the first set of conditions (divisibility and sum of digits), and find the prime y from the equation. So the answer would be two parts: k and y. But y is three primes. Alternatively, the problem may have a typo and it's supposed to mean that the sum of digits is equal to the prime y from the equation. But that\u2019s not clear. Given the original problem, I think the answer should be the value of k (smallest positive integer meeting the conditions) and the primes y (2,5,7). However, in the response format, the answer is supposed to be a single answer. This is confusing.\n\nGiven that the problem is presented as a single question asking for k and y, but in the response format, the answer is a single field, perhaps the answer is k=2 and y=2,5,7. But how to format this?\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"the prime number y such that [...]\", but the equation has three prime solutions. So perhaps the answer for y is the set {2,5,7}. And the answer for k is 2.\n\nBut given the answer format is \"Answer: {your chosen answer}\", perhaps the answer should list both. For example:\n\nAnswer: 2 and 2, 5, 7\n\nBut I need to see how the original question is structured. The user wrote:\n\n\"Find the smallest positive integer k such that [...] and the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y such that [...]\".\n\nThe way it's phrased, it's two separate requirements: find k and find y. So the answer would be k=2 and y=2,5,7.\n\nBut in terms of the answer format, the user might expect the answer to be k=2 and the primes 2,5,7. However, the problem says \"the prime number y\", which is singular, but there are three. This could be a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the cubic equation was supposed to have a single prime solution, but in reality, it has three. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the primes y and then ensure that the sum of digits of k is one of those primes. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf the problem intends that the sum of digits of k is equal to one of the primes y (which are 2,5,7), then k's sum of digits must be 2,5, or7. For k=2, sum is 2 (which is one of the primes y). So that works. If k=5, sum is 5, which is also a prime y. But we need the smallest k. However, if the problem requires that the sum of digits is equal to the prime y (but y being one of 2,5,7), then k's sum of digits must be 2,5, or7. Since k=2 has sum 2, which is in y's list. So that would make sense. But if the problem doesn't make that connection, then k could have a sum of digits being any prime, like 3, which is not in y's list. However, since y's primes are 2,5,7, and the sum of digits of k is a prime number (any prime), but the problem doesn't specify that it's one of the y's. So unless there's a connection intended, they are separate.\n\nBut the way the problem is written: \"the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". The \"and\" probably separates the two requirements: find k with the divisibility and sum of digits prime, and find y from the equation. Therefore, the answer is k=2 and y=2,5,7.\n\nBut how to represent this in the answer? The problem might have a typo, but given the information, we have to proceed.\n\nAssuming that k=2 is correct because it satisfies all the conditions: P(2)=0 divisible by 360, sum of digits 2 (prime). Then the primes y are 2,5,7.\n\nBut in the answer, the user might expect to write k and then the primes. But the problem's wording is a bit unclear. However, the key part for the answer is that k=2 is the smallest positive integer meeting the conditions, and y=2,5,7 are the primes solving the equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is k=2 and y=2,5,7. But how to format this in the answer box.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". It might mean that there are two separate answers required: k and y. But in the answer format, the user might expect to write both. For example:\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{2} and \\boxed{2}, \\boxed{5}, \\boxed{7}\n\nBut typically, such problems expect the main answer (k) and then the other part (y). However, the problem statement is a bit unclear. Given the original problem's ambiguity, but based on the information, the answer for k is 2, and the primes y are 2,5,7.\n\nBut according to the user's response format, the answer should be in the format:\n\nExplanation: ...\nAnswer: ...\nConfidence: ...\n\nSo the Answer part should contain both k and y. But how? If the problem asks for two separate answers, perhaps the answer is written as k=2 and y=2,5,7. Given that the problem says \"the prime number y\", but there are three, perhaps list them all.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might have intended to link the sum of digits of k to the prime y, but in that case, k=2's sum is 2, which is one of the primes. So if the problem had intended that the sum of digits is equal to y, then the answer would be k=2 and y=2. But since the equation has three primes, this is uncertain.\n\nHowever, given the problem as stated, the safest assumption is that the sum of digits of k is any prime, and y are the primes from the equation. Therefore, the answer for k is 2, and the primes y are 2,5,7. Thus, in the Answer field, I need to write both. Given that the problem may be expecting the primes for y and the value for k, perhaps the answer is written as:\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 5, 7\n\nBut that's unclear. Alternatively, the answer is k=2 and the primes are 2,5,7. Given that, but the answer format requires a single answer, perhaps the answer is written as:\n\nAnswer: 2 (for k) and 2, 5, 7 (for y)\n\nBut in the required format, how to denote this? Maybe within the Answer field, state both.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"the prime number y such that...\", which might imply a single answer, but there are three. This is a problem in the question's phrasing. However, based on the mathematics, there are three primes. Therefore, the answer for y is 2,5,7.\n\nSince the user's response format allows only one answer, but the question has two parts (k and y), perhaps the answer is presented as k followed by the primes y. For example:\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 5, 7\n\nBut this is not standard. Alternatively, the answer for k is 2, and the primes y are 2,5,7. But the problem says \"the prime number y\", which is plural. However, the user might have intended that the answer is k and the primes. So perhaps in the Answer box, we list k and the primes. But perhaps the answer is just k=2, and the primes are part of the explanation. But the problem explicitly asks for both.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but based on the user's instruction to output the answer following the format, where Answer is a chosen answer, it's possible that the answer expected is k=2 and the primes y=2,5,7. However, considering that the sum of digits of k=2 is 2, which is one of the primes y=2, and considering the problem might have intended a connection, perhaps the answer is k=2 and y=2. But in reality, the equation has three primes.\n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Given the problem's possible error, but based on mathematical correctness, the primes y are 2,5,7, and k=2 is the smallest k meeting the conditions. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\nExplanation: The polynomial factors as (k-2)(k-1)k(k+1), which is divisible by 360 when k\u22612 mod3 and k\u22610,1,2,4 mod5. The smallest such k is 2, whose digit sum is 2 (prime). The equation has prime solutions y=2,5,7.\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 5, 7\n\nBut this is not standard. Alternatively, present the answer as k=2 and y=2,5,7 in the Answer section. However, in the given format, the Answer is a single box. It's possible that the problem expects k and the primes, but given the ambiguity, the safest way is to answer k=2, since that's the main part, and note the primes in the explanation. But the problem explicitly asks for both. Given the user's instructions, I think we have to include both in the Answer field.\n\nGiven that, in the Answer section, I will write k followed by the primes.\n\nAnswer: 2 and 2, 5, 7\n\nBut to follow standard boxed formatting, perhaps:\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{2} and \\boxed{2}, \\boxed{5}, \\boxed{7}\n\nBut typically, multiple answers are boxed separately. However, the user's format says to put the chosen answer in the Answer field, which could be multiple boxed answers.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects only k, then the answer is 2. But the problem mentions finding y as well. Given the confusion, but based on the problem statement, I think the answer should include both. However, in the given answer format, perhaps I should list k and then the primes.\n\nBut given the time I've spent on this, I'll proceed with the conclusion that k=2 is the correct answer for the first part and the primes y=2,5,7. Therefore, the answer should be written as k=2 and the primes are 2,5,7. So in the Answer field, I'll write both, separated.\n\nExplanation: The smallest k is 2 since P(2)=0, divisible by 360. Its digit sum is 2, a prime. The equation factors to (y-2)(y-5)(y-7)=0, so primes are 2, 5, 7.\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 5, 7\n\nConfidence: 95% (I'm confident in k=2 and the primes y=2,5,7, but there's a 5% uncertainty due to potential misinterpretation of the problem's phrasing.)\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The polynomial \\( k^4 - 2k^3 - k^2 + 2k \\) factors as \\( (k-2)(k-1)k(k+1) \\), which must be divisible by 360 (LCM of 9, 10, 36, 72).

  "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the smallest positive integer k that meets several conditions. Let me break down each condition and figure out how to approach them one by one.\n\nFirst, the main conditions are:\n\n1. k\u2074 - 2k\u00b3 - k\u00b2 + 2k must be divisible by 9, 10, 36, and 72.\n2. The sum of the digits of k in its decimal representation must be a prime number.\n3. Find the prime number y that satisfies the equation y\u00b3 - 14y\u00b2 + 59y -70 = 0.\n\nStarting with the third condition might actually help because once we find y, that could influence the other parts. Let me look at the equation y\u00b3 - 14y\u00b2 + 59y -70 = 0. Since y is a prime number, I can test small primes here.\n\nLet's try y=2: 8 - 56 + 118 -70 = (8-56) = -48, then -48 +118 = 70, 70-70=0. Oh, so y=2 is a root. Let me confirm that. Plugging in 2, indeed 8 -56 +118 -70 = 0. So y=2 is a solution. Now, let's factor the polynomial using this root. If we factor out (y - 2), we can use polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDividing y\u00b3 -14y\u00b2 +59y -70 by (y - 2):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n2 | 1  -14   59  -70\n          2  -24   70\n        ----------------\n          1  -12   35    0\n\nSo the quadratic factor is y\u00b2 -12y +35. Let's factor that: looking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. Those are -5 and -7. So, (y -5)(y -7). Therefore, the roots are y=2, y=5, y=7. All of these are primes. Wait, but the question says \"the prime number y\", so there are three primes here. But maybe the question is referring to a specific one related to k? Or perhaps the answer is the prime y, which could be any of these, but maybe the problem expects all of them? Wait, looking back at the original question: \"the prime number y such that...\" So the equation has three roots, which are 2, 5, 7. All three are primes. Hmm. But the way the question is phrased: \"the prime number y such that...\" So maybe the answer expects all such primes. However, in the response format, it says \"the prime number y\", which is singular. Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe original question says: \"Find the smallest positive integer k such that [...] and the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y such that y\u00b3 -14y\u00b2 +59y -70=0.\"\n\nWait, the structure here is a bit confusing. Let me parse the sentence again. The user is asking to find two things: the smallest positive integer k that meets the divisibility and sum of digits conditions, and also to find the prime number y that satisfies the given cubic equation. So it's two separate things to find: k and y. The answer format should have both. But in the problem, the sum of digits of k has to be a prime number, which is different from y. So the answer is k and y. But looking at the response format, it's just \"your chosen answer\", which might imply combining both? Wait, the user says: \"the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". So the question is to find k and y. But the way the problem is written, the user might have intended that the sum of digits of k is equal to the prime y? Wait, maybe I misread that part. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal question: \"the sum of digits of k in its decimal representation is a prime number and the prime number y such that [...]\". The wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean two separate conditions: sum of digits is a prime (any prime) and then find y which is the prime satisfying the equation. Alternatively, it could mean that the sum of digits is equal to the prime y which is the solution to the equation. But given the structure, it's more likely that these are two separate parts. So first, find k such that:\n\n1. k's polynomial expression is divisible by 9,10,36,72.\n2. The sum of digits of k is a prime number.\n3. Find the prime y that solves the equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be k and y, where k meets the first two conditions, and y is the prime from the equation. However, since the problem mentions \"the prime number y\", which is from the equation, and the sum of digits is a prime (which may not be the same as y). So the answer will have two components: the value of k and the value(s) of y. Wait, but in the problem statement, maybe they are separate. Let me confirm the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Find the smallest positive integer k such that [divisibility conditions], and the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y such that [...]\". So it's a bit ambiguous. But perhaps it's two separate tasks: find k meeting the first two conditions, and also find the prime y from the equation. So the answer will include both k and y.\n\nBut given the answer format, which says \"Answer: {your chosen answer}\", it's possible that the answer requires k and y. However, in the problem statement, since the initial part is about k, and then they mention \"the prime number y\", maybe the answer is k and the primes y. But given the equation has three prime solutions, 2,5,7, which are all primes, so perhaps the answer for y is 2,5,7, but since the problem says \"the prime number y\", maybe it's expecting all three. However, maybe there's a typo and the equation is supposed to have a single prime solution, but in reality, it has three. Let me check the cubic equation again. The roots are 2,5,7. All primes. So maybe the answer for y is 2,5,7.\n\nBut the problem says \"the prime number y\", which is singular, but the equation has three solutions. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the user made an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as: find k such that (conditions) and the sum of digits is a prime, and also find the prime y from the equation. So the answer would have k and the primes y. But given that the problem is presented as a single question, it's possible that the answer is k and y, with y being 2,5,7. However, given that the response format is Answer: {your chosen answer}, perhaps we need to list all possible primes for y and the correct k. But maybe the problem expects that the sum of digits of k is equal to one of the primes y. But that's not necessarily stated. The problem says \"the sum of digits [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". So the \"and\" connects two separate things: finding k with the divisibility and digit sum prime, and finding y which is the prime solution to the equation. So the answer is two parts: k and y=2,5,7.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting to select one y that is linked to k. But perhaps not. Given the way the problem is written, I think the answer requires k and the primes y=2,5,7.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, solve for y in the equation y\u00b3 -14y\u00b2 +59y -70=0.\n\nAs previously, we found the roots are 2,5,7. All primes. So the primes y are 2,5,7. So that part is clear.\n\nNow, moving on to the main part: finding the smallest positive integer k such that:\n\n1. k\u2074 -2k\u00b3 -k\u00b2 +2k is divisible by 9,10,36,72. However, note that 9,10,36,72. But 36 is 4*9, 72 is 8*9. Wait, but 9,10,36,72. To be divisible by all of them, the number must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Let's compute LCM(9,10,36,72).\n\nFirst, factor each:\n\n9 = 3\u00b2\n\n10 = 2 * 5\n\n36 = 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2\n\n72 = 2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2\n\nThus, LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2 * 5 = 8 *9 *5= 360.\n\nTherefore, k\u2074 -2k\u00b3 -k\u00b2 +2k must be divisible by 360.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the smallest k where the polynomial evaluated at k is divisible by 360, and the sum of digits of k is a prime number (which can be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., but since k is a positive integer, and we're looking for the smallest, the sum might be a small prime like 2, 3, 5, 7).\n\nSo our first task is to find the smallest k where P(k) = k\u2074 -2k\u00b3 -k\u00b2 +2k \u2261 0 mod 360, and sum of digits of k is prime.\n\nLet me factor P(k) perhaps. Let's see:\n\nP(k) = k^4 -2k\u00b3 -k\u00b2 +2k\n\nFactor out k:\n\nk(k\u00b3 - 2k\u00b2 -k + 2)\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic polynomial: k\u00b3 -2k\u00b2 -k +2.\n\nTry rational roots. Possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12.\n\nTest k=1: 1 -2 -1 +2 =0. So (k -1) is a factor.\n\nDivide the cubic by (k -1):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n1 | 1  -2  -1  2\n\n          1  -1  -2\n\n        ----------------\n\n          1  -1  -2  0\n\nSo the cubic factors as (k -1)(k\u00b2 -k -2).\n\nFactor the quadratic: k\u00b2 -k -2 = (k -2)(k +1). So overall, P(k) factors as:\n\nk(k -1)(k -2)(k +1)\n\nTherefore, P(k) = k(k -1)(k -2)(k +1) = (k-2)(k-1)k(k+1)\n\nWait, that's four consecutive integers multiplied together? Let me see: (k-2)(k-1)k(k+1). This is the product of four consecutive integers starting from (k-2). For example, if k=3, then 1*2*3*4=24.\n\nBut in general, the product of four consecutive integers is divisible by 4! = 24. But since we need divisibility by 360 = 8 * 9 *5, so 360 = 2\u00b3 * 3\u00b2 *5. Let's see what factors we can get from the product of four consecutive integers.\n\nThe product of four consecutive numbers is divisible by 4! = 24, but may have higher divisibility. Let's check:\n\nIn the product of four consecutive integers, there are two even numbers, one of which is divisible by 4, so 2*4=8, which gives 2\u00b3. There is at least one multiple of 3, maybe two if the numbers include a multiple of 3 and another multiple due to consecutive numbers. For example, in numbers 3,4,5,6: includes 3 and 6 (two multiples of 3). Similarly, 2,3,4,5 includes 3, but not two. So depending on the four numbers, the number of 3s can vary.\n\nAdditionally, to get divisibility by 5, one of the four numbers must be divisible by 5. So, to have P(k) divisible by 360=2\u00b3*3\u00b2*5, the product must have:\n\n- At least three factors of 2 (which it does, since in four consecutive numbers, there are two even numbers, one divisible by 4 (giving three 2s: 4=2\u00b2, and another even number gives 2\u00b9, total 2\u00b3)).\n\n- At least two factors of 3. Since the product of four consecutive numbers includes at least one multiple of 3, but to get two, the four numbers must include two multiples of 3. For example, if the numbers include 3 and 6, then 3 divides both, giving two factors of 3. This happens when k-2, k-1, k, k+1 include two multiples of 3. That would happen when the four numbers span a range that includes two multiples of 3. For example, if k-2 \u22610 mod3 and k+1 \u22610 mod3, but that would mean k\u22612 mod3 and k\u22612 mod3, which might not. Alternatively, if k-1 \u22610 mod3 and k+1 \u22610 mod3, which would require k\u22611 mod3 and k\u22612 mod3, which is impossible. Wait, perhaps it's better to check specific k values.\n\nAlternatively, since four consecutive numbers will include one number \u22610 mod3 and another \u22611, 2, etc. Wait, let's think: In any four consecutive integers, there must be exactly one or two multiples of 3. For example, the numbers 1,2,3,4: 3 is a multiple. 3,4,5,6: 3 and 6. So in cases where the four numbers include two multiples of 3, the total exponent of 3 will be 2. Otherwise, if only one multiple of 3, then exponent is 1. Since we need exponent 2 (3\u00b2), so P(k) must include two multiples of 3, meaning that the four consecutive numbers must include two multiples of 3. That happens when one of the numbers is a multiple of 3 and another is a multiple of 3 as well. The only way this happens is if the four numbers include 3n and 3(n+1), which are two apart. For example, numbers 3,4,5,6: 3 and 6. So the four numbers must span a multiple of 3 and the next multiple of 3. So the four numbers must include two multiples of 3, which requires that the length of the four numbers covers two multiples of 3. Since they are consecutive, the distance between two multiples of 3 is 3, so four consecutive numbers can include two multiples of 3 if they are in a range of 5 numbers. Wait, no. For four consecutive numbers, the maximum gap between the first and last is 3. For example, n, n+1, n+2, n+3. If n \u22610 mod3, then the numbers are 0,1,2,3 mod3: includes 0 and 3 mod3, which are both multiples of 3. So if n \u22610 mod3, then n and n+3 are multiples of 3, but n+3 is outside the four consecutive numbers (since the numbers are n, n+1, n+2, n+3). Wait, n+3 is included. So the four numbers would be 3k, 3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3. Here, 3k and 3k+3 are multiples of 3. So in this case, the four consecutive numbers include two multiples of 3, hence providing two factors of 3. Therefore, if the four numbers start at n \u22610 mod3, then they include two multiples of 3. Similarly, if they start at n \u22611 mod3: n=3k+1, then the numbers are 3k+1, 3k+2, 3k+3, 3k+4. Here, 3k+3 is a multiple of 3, so only one multiple. Similarly, starting at n=3k+2: 3k+2, 3k+3, 3k+4, 3k+5: again only one multiple (3k+3). Therefore, the product will have two factors of 3 only when the four consecutive numbers start at a multiple of 3, i.e., when n \u22610 mod3. Therefore, k-2 \u22610 mod3, which means k \u22612 mod3. Wait, because the four numbers are (k-2), (k-1), k, (k+1). If k-2 \u22610 mod3, then k \u22612 mod3, and the four numbers include k-2=3m and k+1=3m+3=3(m+1), so both 3m and 3(m+1), which are multiples of 3. Therefore, in this case, the product will have two factors of 3. Therefore, to get 3\u00b2 in the product, we need k \u22612 mod3.\n\nAdditionally, the product must be divisible by 5. For that, one of the four consecutive numbers must be divisible by 5. So, either (k-2), (k-1), k, or (k+1) \u22610 mod5. Therefore, k \u22612, 1, 0, or 4 mod5. So k \u22610,1,2,4 mod5.\n\nAlso, the product must be divisible by 8 (since LCM includes 2\u00b3). Since the product of four consecutive numbers, which includes two even numbers, one of which is divisible by 4, so 2*4=8, hence the product is divisible by 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, P(k) is divisible by 360 if:\n\n1. k \u22612 mod3 (to have two factors of 3)\n2. One of the four numbers (k-2, k-1, k, k+1) is divisible by 5 (so k \u22610,1,2,4 mod5)\n3. The product is divisible by 8, which is always true for four consecutive numbers.\n\nTherefore, the conditions reduce to:\n\nk \u22612 mod3\n\nand\n\nk \u22610,1,2,4 mod5\n\nAdditionally, we need sum of digits of k is a prime number. We need the smallest such k.\n\nSo, let's find the smallest k that satisfies:\n\nk \u22612 mod3\n\nand\n\nk \u22610,1,2,4 mod5\n\nand the sum of digits of k is prime.\n\nWe can approach this by checking k starting from the smallest possible and checking the conditions.\n\nFirst, note that k must be at least 2, since for k=1, the product is (1-2)(1-1)(1)(1+1) = (-1)(0)(1)(2)=0, which is divisible by everything, but sum of digits of k=1 is 1, which is not prime. Wait, k=1: P(k)=0, which is divisible by any number, including 360. But sum of digits is 1, not prime. So k=1 is invalid.\n\nk=2: P(2) = (0)(1)(2)(3)=0. Divisible by everything. Sum of digits is 2, which is prime. So k=2? But wait, check the congruence conditions. k=2:\n\nk \u22612 mod3? Yes, 2 mod3.\n\nk=2 mod5? 2 mod5 is allowed (since k can be 0,1,2,4 mod5). So yes. Therefore, k=2 meets the congruence conditions. Sum of digits is 2, which is prime. Therefore, k=2 seems to satisfy all conditions. However, wait, the problem says \"smallest positive integer k such that [...]\". So is k=2 the answer? Let me verify all conditions.\n\nFirst, P(2)=0, which is divisible by 360. Yes. Sum of digits is 2, prime. Prime y from equation is 2,5,7. Wait, but the answer requires k and y. But as per the problem statement, is there a connection between y and k? The problem says \"the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". So the sum of digits is a prime (which for k=2 is 2), and y is 2,5,7. But since the answer format is singular, maybe the problem expects to mention all primes y, but the user instruction says \"the prime number y\", which is plural. However, in the answer format, it's a single answer, so perhaps I should list all three primes. But the way the problem is written, maybe the answer is k=2 and the primes are 2,5,7. However, let's not jump to conclusions yet. Let's check k=2.\n\nBut wait, the polynomial P(k) for k=2 is zero, which is divisible by any number, so it's divisible by 360. Sum of digits is 2, which is prime. So k=2 satisfies all the conditions. Is there a smaller k? k=1: sum of digits is 1, not prime. k=2 is the first. So maybe k=2 is the answer. But wait, let's confirm whether the problem allows k=2. Is there any catch here?\n\nWait, the problem says \"smallest positive integer k such that [...]\". So yes, k=2 is positive and the smallest. So maybe the answer is k=2 and the primes y=2,5,7. But the answer format just says \"Answer: {your chosen answer}\". How should it be structured? Probably k and y. But the problem mentions \"the prime number y such that...\", but there are three primes. So the answer should include k=2 and the primes 2,5,7. But the user's instruction says to output the answer in the given format. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Find the smallest positive integer k such that [conditions], and the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y such that [...]\".\n\nThe structure is a bit ambiguous. It could be that the user is asking for two separate things: find k that meets the first set of conditions (divisibility and sum of digits), and find the prime y from the equation. So the answer would be two parts: k and y. But y is three primes. Alternatively, the problem may have a typo and it's supposed to mean that the sum of digits is equal to the prime y from the equation. But that\u2019s not clear. Given the original problem, I think the answer should be the value of k (smallest positive integer meeting the conditions) and the primes y (2,5,7). However, in the response format, the answer is supposed to be a single answer. This is confusing.\n\nGiven that the problem is presented as a single question asking for k and y, but in the response format, the answer is a single field, perhaps the answer is k=2 and y=2,5,7. But how to format this?\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"the prime number y such that [...]\", but the equation has three prime solutions. So perhaps the answer for y is the set {2,5,7}. And the answer for k is 2.\n\nBut given the answer format is \"Answer: {your chosen answer}\", perhaps the answer should list both. For example:\n\nAnswer: 2 and 2, 5, 7\n\nBut I need to see how the original question is structured. The user wrote:\n\n\"Find the smallest positive integer k such that [...] and the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y such that [...]\".\n\nThe way it's phrased, it's two separate requirements: find k and find y. So the answer would be k=2 and y=2,5,7.\n\nBut in terms of the answer format, the user might expect the answer to be k=2 and the primes 2,5,7. However, the problem says \"the prime number y\", which is singular, but there are three. This could be a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the cubic equation was supposed to have a single prime solution, but in reality, it has three. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the primes y and then ensure that the sum of digits of k is one of those primes. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf the problem intends that the sum of digits of k is equal to one of the primes y (which are 2,5,7), then k's sum of digits must be 2,5, or7. For k=2, sum is 2 (which is one of the primes y). So that works. If k=5, sum is 5, which is also a prime y. But we need the smallest k. However, if the problem requires that the sum of digits is equal to the prime y (but y being one of 2,5,7), then k's sum of digits must be 2,5, or7. Since k=2 has sum 2, which is in y's list. So that would make sense. But if the problem doesn't make that connection, then k could have a sum of digits being any prime, like 3, which is not in y's list. However, since y's primes are 2,5,7, and the sum of digits of k is a prime number (any prime), but the problem doesn't specify that it's one of the y's. So unless there's a connection intended, they are separate.\n\nBut the way the problem is written: \"the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". The \"and\" probably separates the two requirements: find k with the divisibility and sum of digits prime, and find y from the equation. Therefore, the answer is k=2 and y=2,5,7.\n\nBut how to represent this in the answer? The problem might have a typo, but given the information, we have to proceed.\n\nAssuming that k=2 is correct because it satisfies all the conditions: P(2)=0 divisible by 360, sum of digits 2 (prime). Then the primes y are 2,5,7.\n\nBut in the answer, the user might expect to write k and then the primes. But the problem's wording is a bit unclear. However, the key part for the answer is that k=2 is the smallest positive integer meeting the conditions, and y=2,5,7 are the primes solving the equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is k=2 and y=2,5,7. But how to format this in the answer box.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the sum of digits of k [...] is a prime number and the prime number y [...]\". It might mean that there are two separate answers required: k and y. But in the answer format, the user might expect to write both. For example:\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{2} and \\boxed{2}, \\boxed{5}, \\boxed{7}\n\nBut typically, such problems expect the main answer (k) and then the other part (y). However, the problem statement is a bit unclear. Given the original problem's ambiguity, but based on the information, the answer for k is 2, and the primes y are 2,5,7.\n\nBut according to the user's response format, the answer should be in the format:\n\nExplanation: ...\nAnswer: ...\nConfidence: ...\n\nSo the Answer part should contain both k and y. But how? If the problem asks for two separate answers, perhaps the answer is written as k=2 and y=2,5,7. Given that the problem says \"the prime number y\", but there are three, perhaps list them all.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might have intended to link the sum of digits of k to the prime y, but in that case, k=2's sum is 2, which is one of the primes. So if the problem had intended that the sum of digits is equal to y, then the answer would be k=2 and y=2. But since the equation has three primes, this is uncertain.\n\nHowever, given the problem as stated, the safest assumption is that the sum of digits of k is any prime, and y are the primes from the equation. Therefore, the answer for k is 2, and the primes y are 2,5,7. Thus, in the Answer field, I need to write both. Given that the problem may be expecting the primes for y and the value for k, perhaps the answer is written as:\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 5, 7\n\nBut that's unclear. Alternatively, the answer is k=2 and the primes are 2,5,7. Given that, but the answer format requires a single answer, perhaps the answer is written as:\n\nAnswer: 2 (for k) and 2, 5, 7 (for y)\n\nBut in the required format, how to denote this? Maybe within the Answer field, state both.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"the prime number y such that...\", which might imply a single answer, but there are three. This is a problem in the question's phrasing. However, based on the mathematics, there are three primes. Therefore, the answer for y is 2,5,7.\n\nSince the user's response format allows only one answer, but the question has two parts (k and y), perhaps the answer is presented as k followed by the primes y. For example:\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 5, 7\n\nBut this is not standard. Alternatively, the answer for k is 2, and the primes y are 2,5,7. But the problem says \"the prime number y\", which is plural. However, the user might have intended that the answer is k and the primes. So perhaps in the Answer box, we list k and the primes. But perhaps the answer is just k=2, and the primes are part of the explanation. But the problem explicitly asks for both.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but based on the user's instruction to output the answer following the format, where Answer is a chosen answer, it's possible that the answer expected is k=2 and the primes y=2,5,7. However, considering that the sum of digits of k=2 is 2, which is one of the primes y=2, and considering the problem might have intended a connection, perhaps the answer is k=2 and y=2. But in reality, the equation has three primes.\n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Given the problem's possible error, but based on mathematical correctness, the primes y are 2,5,7, and k=2 is the smallest k meeting the conditions. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\nExplanation: The polynomial factors as (k-2)(k-1)k(k+1), which is divisible by 360 when k\u22612 mod3 and k\u22610,1,2,4 mod5. The smallest such k is 2, whose digit sum is 2 (prime). The equation has prime solutions y=2,5,7.\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 5, 7\n\nBut this is not standard. Alternatively, present the answer as k=2 and y=2,5,7 in the Answer section. However, in the given format, the Answer is a single box. It's possible that the problem expects k and the primes, but given the ambiguity, the safest way is to answer k=2, since that's the main part, and note the primes in the explanation. But the problem explicitly asks for both. Given the user's instructions, I think we have to include both in the Answer field.\n\nGiven that, in the Answer section, I will write k followed by the primes.\n\nAnswer: 2 and 2, 5, 7\n\nBut to follow standard boxed formatting, perhaps:\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{2} and \\boxed{2}, \\boxed{5}, \\boxed{7}\n\nBut typically, multiple answers are boxed separately. However, the user's format says to put the chosen answer in the Answer field, which could be multiple boxed answers.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects only k, then the answer is 2. But the problem mentions finding y as well. Given the confusion, but based on the problem statement, I think the answer should include both. However, in the given answer format, perhaps I should list k and then the primes.\n\nBut given the time I've spent on this, I'll proceed with the conclusion that k=2 is the correct answer for the first part and the primes y=2,5,7. Therefore, the answer should be written as k=2 and the primes are 2,5,7. So in the Answer field, I'll write both, separated.\n\nExplanation: The smallest k is 2 since P(2)=0, divisible by 360. Its digit sum is 2, a prime. The equation factors to (y-2)(y-5)(y-7)=0, so primes are 2, 5, 7.\n\nAnswer: 2, 2, 5, 7\n\nConfidence: 95% (I'm confident in k=2 and the primes y=2,5,7, but there's a 5% uncertainty due to potential misinterpretation of the problem's phrasing.)",
