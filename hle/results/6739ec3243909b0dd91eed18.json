  "question": "A single protofilament of microtubule grows at the speed of 2\u00b5m/min. Considering that there is no catastrophe in the microtubule nucleation and the size of the tubulin unit is of the order of 5 nm, how many tubulin units are added to the growing microtubule per minute? \n\n\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 400\nB. 1600\nC. 3200\nD. 5200\nE. 3500",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about how many tubulin units are added to a growing microtubule per minute. The given information is that a single protofilament grows at 2 \u00b5m per minute, there's no catastrophe (so we don't have to worry about shrinking), and each tubulin unit is about 5 nm in size.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the units so they match. The growth speed is in micrometers per minute, and the tubulin size is in nanometers. I remember that 1 micrometer is 1000 nanometers. So converting 2 \u00b5m to nanometers would be 2 * 1000 = 2000 nm per minute. \n\nNow, if each tubulin unit is 5 nm long, then the number of units added per minute would be the total growth divided by the size per unit. So 2000 nm/min divided by 5 nm per tubulin unit. Let me calculate that: 2000 / 5 equals 400. So that would be 400 tubulin units per minute. But wait, the answer options include 400 as option A. But wait, microtubules have protofilaments. Wait, the question says a single protofilament is growing. So each protofilament adds 400 units. But wait, a microtubule is made of multiple protofilaments. But the question specifically says \"a single protofilament\". So in that case, the calculation would indeed be 400. But wait, wait. Wait, microtubules are typically made of 13 protofilaments arranged in a tube. But the question is about a single protofilament. So the given growth rate is per protofilament. So each protofilament adds 400 units per minute, so the answer would be A. But wait the answer options are A through E, and A is 400. But wait, maybe I've missed something here. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, the problem states that the microtubule's protofilament is growing at 2 \u00b5m per minute. So each protofilament adds 2 \u00b5m of length each minute. Each tubulin dimer contributes 8 nm? Wait, wait, no, the question says the size of the tubulin unit is of the order of 5 nm. So each unit is 5 nm. So if each protofilament grows 2000 nm in a minute, dividing by 5 gives 400 units per minute. Therefore, the answer should be A. But why are there other options? Let me make sure. Oh, wait. Wait, the problem says \"the size of the tubulin unit is of the order of 5 nm.\" So each tubulin dimer adds 5 nm in length when they attach. So each time a dimer is added, the protofilament lengthens by 5 nm. So, if the growth rate is 2 \u00b5m per minute, which is 2000 nm per minute, then 2000 divided by 5 is 400. So 400 units per minute. Therefore, answer A. But wait, maybe I should check the units again. Yeah, 2 \u00b5m is 2000 nm. Divided by 5 nm per unit gives 400 units. So answer A. But why is there an option B with 1600? Maybe if considering multiple protofilaments? But the question is about a single protofilament. So option A is correct. So confidence is high here. Maybe 95%?\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: The growth rate of a single protofilament is 2 \u00b5m/min, which converts to 2000 nm/min. Each tubulin unit contributes 5 nm in length. Dividing the total growth (2000 nm) by the size per unit (5 nm) gives 2000/5 = 400 tubulin units added per minute. Since the question specifies a single protofilament, there is no need to account for multiple protofilaments.  \n\nAnswer: A. 400  \nConfidence: 95%",
