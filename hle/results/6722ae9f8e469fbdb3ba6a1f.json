  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the shortest distance from the point P(3,4,5) to the line L(t) defined by those parametric equations. Hmm, I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a line in 3D space can be found using a formula involving vectors. Let me think about how that works.\n\nFirst, the line L(t) is given by parametric equations. I can write this in vector form. The direction vector of the line should be the coefficients of t in each equation. So the direction vector v is <2, -3, 4>. That's because when t increases by 1, x increases by 2, y decreases by 3, and z increases by 4. So direction vector v = (2, -3, 4).\n\nNow, the point P is (3,4,5). The line L(t) has a point when t=0, which would be (1, 2, -1). Let me check the equations: when t=0, x=1, y=2, z=-1. So point A on the line is (1,2,-1). \n\nSo, to find the distance from P to the line, I think the formula is the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AP and v, divided by the magnitude of v. Wait, right. The formula is |AP \u00d7 v| / |v|. Let me confirm that.\n\nAP is the vector from point A to point P. So AP = P - A = (3-1, 4-2, 5-(-1)) = (2, 2, 6). So AP vector is (2,2,6). Then the direction vector v is (2, -3,4).\n\nNext, compute the cross product AP \u00d7 v. Let's do that. The cross product of vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is:\n\n(i component: a2b3 - a3b2,\n j component: a3b1 - a1b3,\n k component: a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nSo AP \u00d7 v:\n\ni component: (2)(4) - (6)(-3) = 8 +18 = 26\n\nj component: (6)(2) - (2)(4) =12 -8 =4 \u2192 but wait, j component is negative of that? Wait cross product formula: the j component is a3b1 - a1b3, which is (6)(2) - (2)(4)=12-8=4, but in the cross product, the j component is subtracted. So the cross product is (26, -4, ... )\n\nWait let me recalculate carefully. Let me write out the vectors:\n\nAP = (2,2,6)\n\nv = (2, -3,4)\n\nCross product AP \u00d7 v:\n\ni component: (2)(4) - (6)(-3) = 8 +18 =26\n\nj component: (6)(2) - (2)(4) =12 -8=4. But in cross product, j is the negative of (a1b3 - a3b1). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me recall the formula. The cross product of (a1,a2,a3) \u00d7 (b1,b2,b3) is computed as:\n\n(i  j  k)\n(a1 a2 a3)\n(b1 b2 b3)\n\nSo determinant:\n\ni*(a2b3 - a3b2) - j*(a1b3 - a3b1) + k*(a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nSo AP \u00d7 v:\n\ni*(2*4 -6*(-3)) - j*(2*4 -6*2) + k*(2*(-3) -2*2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\ni: (8 +18)=26 \u2192 26i\n\nj: (8 -12)= -4 \u2192 but it's subtracted, so - (-4) = +4j. Wait, no. Let me do step by step.\n\nFirst term (i component): 2*4 -6*(-3) =8 +18=26 \u2192 26i\n\nSecond term (j component): a1b3 - a3b1 =2*4 -6*2=8 -12= -4. Since the j component is subtracted, it's - (-4) = +4j\n\nThird term (k component): a1b2 - a2b1 =2*(-3) -2*2 =-6 -4=-10 \u2192 -10k\n\nSo AP \u00d7 v = (26, 4, -10)\n\nWait, or is that (26i +4j -10k)? So the cross product vector is (26,4,-10).\n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2). Let's calculate that:\n\n26\u00b2=676, 4\u00b2=16, (-10)^2=100. Total sum: 676+16=692, 692+100=792. So sqrt(792). Let me see if that simplifies. 792 divided by 4 is 198, 198=9*22. So sqrt(792)=sqrt(4*198)=2*sqrt(198)=2*sqrt(9*22)=2*3*sqrt(22)=6*sqrt(22). Wait, but 198 is 9*22, so sqrt(198)=3*sqrt(22). So sqrt(792)=sqrt(4*198)=2*3*sqrt(22)=6\u221a22. So |AP \u00d7 v|=6\u221a22.\n\nThen the magnitude of vector v is |v|=sqrt(2\u00b2 + (-3)^2 +4\u00b2)=sqrt(4+9+16)=sqrt(29). So |v|=\u221a29.\n\nTherefore, the distance is |AP \u00d7 v| / |v| = (6\u221a22)/\u221a29. Hmm, but maybe we can rationalize the denominator? Or perhaps leave it as is. Wait, but maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the cross product again.\n\nWait, AP is (2,2,6), v is (2,-3,4). Let me recompute the cross product step by step.\n\ni component: (AP.y * v.z) - (AP.z * v.y) = 2*4 -6*(-3)=8 +18=26. Correct.\n\nj component: (AP.z * v.x) - (AP.x * v.z) =6*2 -2*4=12-8=4. But since it's the j component, it's subtracted. So cross product j component is -4. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me check the cross product formula again. The formula is:\n\nIf vector a = (a1, a2, a3) and vector b = (b1, b2, b3), then their cross product is:\n\n(a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nWait, no, that's for the components (i, j, k). Wait no. The cross product is calculated as:\n\ni*(a2b3 - a3b2) - j*(a1b3 - a3b1) + k*(a1b2 -a2b1)\n\nSo actually for the j component, it's -(a1b3 - a3b1). So let's apply that.\n\nSo AP \u00d7 v:\n\ni*(2*4 -6*(-3)) - j*(2*4 -6*2) + k*(2*(-3) -2*2)\n\nSo compute each component:\n\ni: 2*4=8, 6*(-3)=-18, so 8 - (-18)=26. So i component 26.\n\n-j*(2*4 -6*2) \u2192 8-12=-4, so -j*(-4)=4j.\n\nk: 2*(-3)=-6, 2*2=4 \u2192 -6 -4= -10.\n\nSo cross product is (26,4,-10). So magnitude sqrt(26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2)=sqrt(676 +16 +100)=sqrt(792). As before. So that's correct.\n\nThen |v|=sqrt(2\u00b2 + (-3)^2 +4^2)=sqrt(4+9+16)=sqrt(29). So yes.\n\nTherefore, distance is sqrt(792)/sqrt(29). Let's simplify sqrt(792)/sqrt(29)=sqrt(792/29). But 792 divided by 29, wait 29*27=783, 29*27.31=792? Hmmm, maybe not a whole number. Alternatively, sqrt(792)=sqrt(4*198)=2*sqrt(198)=2*sqrt(9*22)=2*3*sqrt(22)=6*sqrt(22). So sqrt(792)=6\u221a22. Then 6\u221a22 / \u221a29. Which can be written as 6\u221a(22/29). But perhaps they want the answer in terms of a simplified radical. So let's see: 6 times sqrt(22/29) is the same as 6 sqrt(638)/29? Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, rationalize the denominator:\n\n6\u221a22 / \u221a29 = 6\u221a(22*29) / 29. So 6\u221a638 /29. But I don't think 638 factors into anything. Let's check 638 divided by 2 is 319. Then 319 is 11*29? 11*29=319. Yes. So 638=2*11*29. So sqrt(638)=sqrt(2*11*29), which can't be simplified further. So the distance is (6\u221a638)/29. Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should leave it as 6\u221a22 divided by \u221a29. But perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me recalculate AP and v cross product.\n\nAP is (2,2,6), v is (2,-3,4).\n\nCross product components:\n\ni: (2*4) - (6*(-3)) =8 +18=26\n\nj: (6*2) - (2*4) =12 -8=4 \u2192 but since it's the j component, it's subtracted, so -4j?\n\nWait, no, according to the cross product formula, the j component is (a3b1 - a1b3), which is (6*2 -2*4)=12-8=4. But in the cross product formula, the j component is subtracted. So cross product is (26, -4, -10).\n\nWait, this is conflicting with earlier. Let me use the standard formula again.\n\nGiven vectors a = (a1,a2,a3) and b=(b1,b2,b3), cross product is:\n\n( a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1 )\n\nSo for AP = (2,2,6) and v=(2,-3,4):\n\ni component: a2b3 - a3b2 = 2*4 -6*(-3) =8 +18=26\n\nj component: a3b1 - a1b3 =6*2 -2*4=12-8=4\n\nk component: a1b2 - a2b1 =2*(-3) -2*2= -6 -4= -10\n\nSo cross product is (26,4,-10). Wait, j component is a3b1 - a1b3, which is 4, so the cross product vector is (26,4,-10). Then magnitude sqrt(26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2).\n\nAs before, which is sqrt(676 +16 +100)=sqrt(792). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula gives |AP \u00d7 v| / |v| = sqrt(792)/sqrt(29) = sqrt(792/29). Wait, but 792 divided by 29 is 27.310... Not a perfect square. Alternatively, sqrt(792) is 6\u221a22, so 6\u221a22 /\u221a29, which can be rationalized as 6\u221a(22*29)/29. So 6\u221a638 /29. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe I picked the wrong point A on the line. Because any point on the line can be used. Let me check again. The line L(t) is given by (1 +2t, 2 -3t, -1 +4t). So when t=0, it's (1,2,-1). So that's point A. Yes, that's correct. So AP is from (1,2,-1) to (3,4,5), which is (2,2,6). Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute the distance. Let's think parametrically. The shortest distance occurs when the vector from P to the line is perpendicular to the direction vector of the line. So, if Q is the point on the line closest to P, then PQ is perpendicular to v.\n\nSo, let's parametrize Q as (2t +1, -3t +2,4t -1). Then vector PQ would be (2t +1 -3, -3t +2 -4,4t -1 -5) = (2t -2, -3t -2,4t -6). This vector PQ must be perpendicular to v=(2,-3,4), so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, PQ \u22c5 v = 0.\n\nCompute (2t-2)*2 + (-3t -2)*(-3) + (4t -6)*4 =0.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (2t -2)*2 =4t -4\n\nSecond term: (-3t -2)*(-3)=9t +6\n\nThird term: (4t -6)*4=16t -24\n\nAdd them all up:\n\n4t -4 +9t +6 +16t -24 = (4t +9t +16t) + (-4 +6 -24)\n\n=29t -22 =0\n\nSo 29t =22 \u2192 t=22/29.\n\nSo the point Q on the line is at t=22/29.\n\nNow, compute Q's coordinates:\n\nx=2*(22/29)+1=44/29 +29/29=73/29\n\ny=-3*(22/29)+2= -66/29 +58/29= -8/29\n\nz=4*(22/29)-1=88/29 -29/29=59/29\n\nSo Q=(73/29, -8/29,59/29)\n\nThen the vector PQ is Q - P, which is (73/29 -3, -8/29 -4,59/29 -5).\n\nCompute each component:\n\n73/29 -3 =73/29 -87/29= -14/29\n\n-8/29 -4= -8/29 -116/29= -124/29\n\n59/29 -5=59/29 -145/29= -86/29\n\nSo vector PQ is (-14/29, -124/29, -86/29)\n\nThen the magnitude of PQ is sqrt[ (-14/29)^2 + (-124/29)^2 + (-86/29)^2 ]\n\nCompute each term squared:\n\n(14\u00b2)/(29\u00b2) =196/841\n\n(124\u00b2)=15376 \u2192 15376/841\n\n(86\u00b2)=7396 \u21927396/841\n\nSum: (196 +15376 +7396)/841 = let's compute numerator:\n\n196 +15376=15572; 15572 +7396=22968\n\nSo sqrt(22968/841) = sqrt(22968)/29.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(22968). Let's see:\n\n22968 divided by 4=5742. So sqrt(4*5742)=2*sqrt(5742). Hmm, 5742. Let's factor this. 5742 \u00f72=2871. 2871: 2+8+7+1=18, divisible by 9? 2871 \u00f79=319. 319: 319 \u00f711=29. So 319=11*29. So 5742=2*9*11*29. Therefore sqrt(5742)=sqrt(2*9*11*29)=3*sqrt(2*11*29)=3*sqrt(638). So sqrt(22968)=sqrt(4*5742)=2*3*sqrt(638)=6\u221a638. Therefore the magnitude is (6\u221a638)/29, which matches the previous method's result, since earlier we had 6\u221a638 /29. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance is 6\u221a638 /29. But wait, in the first method, we had sqrt(792)/sqrt(29). Let's see if these are equal.\n\n792/29 is equal to 27.310... Let's compute 6\u221a638 divided by 29:\n\nCompute 6* sqrt(638) \u22486*25.256\u2248151.536. Then divided by 29\u22485.225.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(792)=28.142, divided by sqrt(29)=5.385\u224828.142/5.385\u22485.225. So they are the same. Therefore, both methods give the same result. So the answer should be 6\u221a(22*29)/29, which is 6\u221a638 /29, but maybe there's a simplification. Wait, 638=2*11*29, so sqrt(638)=sqrt(2*11*29). No further simplification possible, so the answer is (6\u221a638)/29. Alternatively, expressed as 6\u221a(22/29)*sqrt(29*29)/29? Wait, that's perhaps not helpful.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is better left as sqrt(792/29). Wait, sqrt(792)/sqrt(29) is equivalent to sqrt(792/29). But 792= 8*99=8*9*11= 72*11. Hmm, 792/29=27.310... Not a perfect square. So maybe we can leave it as sqrt(792/29) but that's not simplified. Alternatively, 792= 4*198=4*9*22=36*22. So sqrt(792)=6\u221a22. So sqrt(792)/sqrt(29)=6\u221a22 / sqrt(29) =6\u221a(22/29). But this is equivalent to 6\u221a(22*29)/29=6\u221a638 /29. Either form is acceptable. Maybe in the answer, they want it rationalized, so 6\u221a638 /29. But let me check the options or if there's a mistake in calculation. Wait, cross product magnitude was sqrt(792), which is 6\u221a22. So divide by sqrt(29), so 6\u221a22 / sqrt(29) =6\u221a(22*29)/29. So yes, 6\u221a638 /29. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the parametric approach, we get the same result, so that's correct. Therefore, the shortest distance is 6\u221a638 /29. Let me confirm once more that there is no calculation error.\n\nWait, cross product vector is (26,4,-10), magnitude squared is 26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2=676 +16 +100=792. So sqrt(792)=6\u221a22. Then divided by sqrt(29), which is the answer. Therefore, the distance is (6\u221a22)/\u221a29. But maybe it's better to leave it as 6\u221a(22/29), but generally, it's rationalized. So 6\u221a(22*29)/29=6\u221a638/29. Therefore, the answer is 6\u221a638\u204429.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product components. Let me check again. AP=(2,2,6), v=(2,-3,4). Cross product:\n\ni component: (2)(4) - (6)(-3)=8+18=26\n\nj component: (6)(2) - (2)(4)=12-8=4. But in cross product, j component is subtracted. Wait, no. The cross product formula is:\n\ni*(a2b3 -a3b2) - j*(a1b3 -a3b1) +k*(a1b2 -a2b1). So the j component is -(a1b3 -a3b1). So for AP \u00d7 v:\n\nj component is -(2*4 -6*2)= -(8-12)= -(-4)=4. So cross product is (26,4,-10). So yes, that's correct. Then the magnitude is sqrt(26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2)=sqrt(792). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is that the shortest distance is 6\u221a22 / sqrt(29), which is equivalent to 6\u221a(22*29)/29 =6\u221a638/29. Therefore, the answer is 6\u221a638\u204429. Let me check for any arithmetic errors once more. The calculation seems correct.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the shortest distance from the point P(3,4,5) to the line L(t) defined by those parametric equations. Hmm, I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a line in 3D space can be found using a formula involving vectors. Let me think about how that works.\n\nFirst, the line L(t) is given by parametric equations. I can write this in vector form. The direction vector of the line should be the coefficients of t in each equation. So the direction vector v is <2, -3, 4>. That's because when t increases by 1, x increases by 2, y decreases by 3, and z increases by 4. So direction vector v = (2, -3, 4).\n\nNow, the point P is (3,4,5). The line L(t) has a point when t=0, which would be (1, 2, -1). Let me check the equations: when t=0, x=1, y=2, z=-1. So point A on the line is (1,2,-1). \n\nSo, to find the distance from P to the line, I think the formula is the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AP and v, divided by the magnitude of v. Wait, right. The formula is |AP \u00d7 v| / |v|. Let me confirm that.\n\nAP is the vector from point A to point P. So AP = P - A = (3-1, 4-2, 5-(-1)) = (2, 2, 6). So AP vector is (2,2,6). Then the direction vector v is (2, -3,4).\n\nNext, compute the cross product AP \u00d7 v. Let's do that. The cross product of vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is:\n\n(i component: a2b3 - a3b2,\n j component: a3b1 - a1b3,\n k component: a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nSo AP \u00d7 v:\n\ni component: (2)(4) - (6)(-3) = 8 +18 = 26\n\nj component: (6)(2) - (2)(4) =12 -8 =4 \u2192 but wait, j component is negative of that? Wait cross product formula: the j component is a3b1 - a1b3, which is (6)(2) - (2)(4)=12-8=4, but in the cross product, the j component is subtracted. So the cross product is (26, -4, ... )\n\nWait let me recalculate carefully. Let me write out the vectors:\n\nAP = (2,2,6)\n\nv = (2, -3,4)\n\nCross product AP \u00d7 v:\n\ni component: (2)(4) - (6)(-3) = 8 +18 =26\n\nj component: (6)(2) - (2)(4) =12 -8=4. But in cross product, j is the negative of (a1b3 - a3b1). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me recall the formula. The cross product of (a1,a2,a3) \u00d7 (b1,b2,b3) is computed as:\n\n(i  j  k)\n(a1 a2 a3)\n(b1 b2 b3)\n\nSo determinant:\n\ni*(a2b3 - a3b2) - j*(a1b3 - a3b1) + k*(a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nSo AP \u00d7 v:\n\ni*(2*4 -6*(-3)) - j*(2*4 -6*2) + k*(2*(-3) -2*2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\ni: (8 +18)=26 \u2192 26i\n\nj: (8 -12)= -4 \u2192 but it's subtracted, so - (-4) = +4j. Wait, no. Let me do step by step.\n\nFirst term (i component): 2*4 -6*(-3) =8 +18=26 \u2192 26i\n\nSecond term (j component): a1b3 - a3b1 =2*4 -6*2=8 -12= -4. Since the j component is subtracted, it's - (-4) = +4j\n\nThird term (k component): a1b2 - a2b1 =2*(-3) -2*2 =-6 -4=-10 \u2192 -10k\n\nSo AP \u00d7 v = (26, 4, -10)\n\nWait, or is that (26i +4j -10k)? So the cross product vector is (26,4,-10).\n\nNow, the magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2). Let's calculate that:\n\n26\u00b2=676, 4\u00b2=16, (-10)^2=100. Total sum: 676+16=692, 692+100=792. So sqrt(792). Let me see if that simplifies. 792 divided by 4 is 198, 198=9*22. So sqrt(792)=sqrt(4*198)=2*sqrt(198)=2*sqrt(9*22)=2*3*sqrt(22)=6*sqrt(22). Wait, but 198 is 9*22, so sqrt(198)=3*sqrt(22). So sqrt(792)=sqrt(4*198)=2*3*sqrt(22)=6\u221a22. So |AP \u00d7 v|=6\u221a22.\n\nThen the magnitude of vector v is |v|=sqrt(2\u00b2 + (-3)^2 +4\u00b2)=sqrt(4+9+16)=sqrt(29). So |v|=\u221a29.\n\nTherefore, the distance is |AP \u00d7 v| / |v| = (6\u221a22)/\u221a29. Hmm, but maybe we can rationalize the denominator? Or perhaps leave it as is. Wait, but maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the cross product again.\n\nWait, AP is (2,2,6), v is (2,-3,4). Let me recompute the cross product step by step.\n\ni component: (AP.y * v.z) - (AP.z * v.y) = 2*4 -6*(-3)=8 +18=26. Correct.\n\nj component: (AP.z * v.x) - (AP.x * v.z) =6*2 -2*4=12-8=4. But since it's the j component, it's subtracted. So cross product j component is -4. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me check the cross product formula again. The formula is:\n\nIf vector a = (a1, a2, a3) and vector b = (b1, b2, b3), then their cross product is:\n\n(a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nWait, no, that's for the components (i, j, k). Wait no. The cross product is calculated as:\n\ni*(a2b3 - a3b2) - j*(a1b3 - a3b1) + k*(a1b2 -a2b1)\n\nSo actually for the j component, it's -(a1b3 - a3b1). So let's apply that.\n\nSo AP \u00d7 v:\n\ni*(2*4 -6*(-3)) - j*(2*4 -6*2) + k*(2*(-3) -2*2)\n\nSo compute each component:\n\ni: 2*4=8, 6*(-3)=-18, so 8 - (-18)=26. So i component 26.\n\n-j*(2*4 -6*2) \u2192 8-12=-4, so -j*(-4)=4j.\n\nk: 2*(-3)=-6, 2*2=4 \u2192 -6 -4= -10.\n\nSo cross product is (26,4,-10). So magnitude sqrt(26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2)=sqrt(676 +16 +100)=sqrt(792). As before. So that's correct.\n\nThen |v|=sqrt(2\u00b2 + (-3)^2 +4^2)=sqrt(4+9+16)=sqrt(29). So yes.\n\nTherefore, distance is sqrt(792)/sqrt(29). Let's simplify sqrt(792)/sqrt(29)=sqrt(792/29). But 792 divided by 29, wait 29*27=783, 29*27.31=792? Hmmm, maybe not a whole number. Alternatively, sqrt(792)=sqrt(4*198)=2*sqrt(198)=2*sqrt(9*22)=2*3*sqrt(22)=6*sqrt(22). So sqrt(792)=6\u221a22. Then 6\u221a22 / \u221a29. Which can be written as 6\u221a(22/29). But perhaps they want the answer in terms of a simplified radical. So let's see: 6 times sqrt(22/29) is the same as 6 sqrt(638)/29? Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, rationalize the denominator:\n\n6\u221a22 / \u221a29 = 6\u221a(22*29) / 29. So 6\u221a638 /29. But I don't think 638 factors into anything. Let's check 638 divided by 2 is 319. Then 319 is 11*29? 11*29=319. Yes. So 638=2*11*29. So sqrt(638)=sqrt(2*11*29), which can't be simplified further. So the distance is (6\u221a638)/29. Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should leave it as 6\u221a22 divided by \u221a29. But perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me recalculate AP and v cross product.\n\nAP is (2,2,6), v is (2,-3,4).\n\nCross product components:\n\ni: (2*4) - (6*(-3)) =8 +18=26\n\nj: (6*2) - (2*4) =12 -8=4 \u2192 but since it's the j component, it's subtracted, so -4j?\n\nWait, no, according to the cross product formula, the j component is (a3b1 - a1b3), which is (6*2 -2*4)=12-8=4. But in the cross product formula, the j component is subtracted. So cross product is (26, -4, -10).\n\nWait, this is conflicting with earlier. Let me use the standard formula again.\n\nGiven vectors a = (a1,a2,a3) and b=(b1,b2,b3), cross product is:\n\n( a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1 )\n\nSo for AP = (2,2,6) and v=(2,-3,4):\n\ni component: a2b3 - a3b2 = 2*4 -6*(-3) =8 +18=26\n\nj component: a3b1 - a1b3 =6*2 -2*4=12-8=4\n\nk component: a1b2 - a2b1 =2*(-3) -2*2= -6 -4= -10\n\nSo cross product is (26,4,-10). Wait, j component is a3b1 - a1b3, which is 4, so the cross product vector is (26,4,-10). Then magnitude sqrt(26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2).\n\nAs before, which is sqrt(676 +16 +100)=sqrt(792). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula gives |AP \u00d7 v| / |v| = sqrt(792)/sqrt(29) = sqrt(792/29). Wait, but 792 divided by 29 is 27.310... Not a perfect square. Alternatively, sqrt(792) is 6\u221a22, so 6\u221a22 /\u221a29, which can be rationalized as 6\u221a(22*29)/29. So 6\u221a638 /29. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe I picked the wrong point A on the line. Because any point on the line can be used. Let me check again. The line L(t) is given by (1 +2t, 2 -3t, -1 +4t). So when t=0, it's (1,2,-1). So that's point A. Yes, that's correct. So AP is from (1,2,-1) to (3,4,5), which is (2,2,6). Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute the distance. Let's think parametrically. The shortest distance occurs when the vector from P to the line is perpendicular to the direction vector of the line. So, if Q is the point on the line closest to P, then PQ is perpendicular to v.\n\nSo, let's parametrize Q as (2t +1, -3t +2,4t -1). Then vector PQ would be (2t +1 -3, -3t +2 -4,4t -1 -5) = (2t -2, -3t -2,4t -6). This vector PQ must be perpendicular to v=(2,-3,4), so their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, PQ \u22c5 v = 0.\n\nCompute (2t-2)*2 + (-3t -2)*(-3) + (4t -6)*4 =0.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (2t -2)*2 =4t -4\n\nSecond term: (-3t -2)*(-3)=9t +6\n\nThird term: (4t -6)*4=16t -24\n\nAdd them all up:\n\n4t -4 +9t +6 +16t -24 = (4t +9t +16t) + (-4 +6 -24)\n\n=29t -22 =0\n\nSo 29t =22 \u2192 t=22/29.\n\nSo the point Q on the line is at t=22/29.\n\nNow, compute Q's coordinates:\n\nx=2*(22/29)+1=44/29 +29/29=73/29\n\ny=-3*(22/29)+2= -66/29 +58/29= -8/29\n\nz=4*(22/29)-1=88/29 -29/29=59/29\n\nSo Q=(73/29, -8/29,59/29)\n\nThen the vector PQ is Q - P, which is (73/29 -3, -8/29 -4,59/29 -5).\n\nCompute each component:\n\n73/29 -3 =73/29 -87/29= -14/29\n\n-8/29 -4= -8/29 -116/29= -124/29\n\n59/29 -5=59/29 -145/29= -86/29\n\nSo vector PQ is (-14/29, -124/29, -86/29)\n\nThen the magnitude of PQ is sqrt[ (-14/29)^2 + (-124/29)^2 + (-86/29)^2 ]\n\nCompute each term squared:\n\n(14\u00b2)/(29\u00b2) =196/841\n\n(124\u00b2)=15376 \u2192 15376/841\n\n(86\u00b2)=7396 \u21927396/841\n\nSum: (196 +15376 +7396)/841 = let's compute numerator:\n\n196 +15376=15572; 15572 +7396=22968\n\nSo sqrt(22968/841) = sqrt(22968)/29.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(22968). Let's see:\n\n22968 divided by 4=5742. So sqrt(4*5742)=2*sqrt(5742). Hmm, 5742. Let's factor this. 5742 \u00f72=2871. 2871: 2+8+7+1=18, divisible by 9? 2871 \u00f79=319. 319: 319 \u00f711=29. So 319=11*29. So 5742=2*9*11*29. Therefore sqrt(5742)=sqrt(2*9*11*29)=3*sqrt(2*11*29)=3*sqrt(638). So sqrt(22968)=sqrt(4*5742)=2*3*sqrt(638)=6\u221a638. Therefore the magnitude is (6\u221a638)/29, which matches the previous method's result, since earlier we had 6\u221a638 /29. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance is 6\u221a638 /29. But wait, in the first method, we had sqrt(792)/sqrt(29). Let's see if these are equal.\n\n792/29 is equal to 27.310... Let's compute 6\u221a638 divided by 29:\n\nCompute 6* sqrt(638) \u22486*25.256\u2248151.536. Then divided by 29\u22485.225.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(792)=28.142, divided by sqrt(29)=5.385\u224828.142/5.385\u22485.225. So they are the same. Therefore, both methods give the same result. So the answer should be 6\u221a(22*29)/29, which is 6\u221a638 /29, but maybe there's a simplification. Wait, 638=2*11*29, so sqrt(638)=sqrt(2*11*29). No further simplification possible, so the answer is (6\u221a638)/29. Alternatively, expressed as 6\u221a(22/29)*sqrt(29*29)/29? Wait, that's perhaps not helpful.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is better left as sqrt(792/29). Wait, sqrt(792)/sqrt(29) is equivalent to sqrt(792/29). But 792= 8*99=8*9*11= 72*11. Hmm, 792/29=27.310... Not a perfect square. So maybe we can leave it as sqrt(792/29) but that's not simplified. Alternatively, 792= 4*198=4*9*22=36*22. So sqrt(792)=6\u221a22. So sqrt(792)/sqrt(29)=6\u221a22 / sqrt(29) =6\u221a(22/29). But this is equivalent to 6\u221a(22*29)/29=6\u221a638 /29. Either form is acceptable. Maybe in the answer, they want it rationalized, so 6\u221a638 /29. But let me check the options or if there's a mistake in calculation. Wait, cross product magnitude was sqrt(792), which is 6\u221a22. So divide by sqrt(29), so 6\u221a22 / sqrt(29) =6\u221a(22*29)/29. So yes, 6\u221a638 /29. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the parametric approach, we get the same result, so that's correct. Therefore, the shortest distance is 6\u221a638 /29. Let me confirm once more that there is no calculation error.\n\nWait, cross product vector is (26,4,-10), magnitude squared is 26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2=676 +16 +100=792. So sqrt(792)=6\u221a22. Then divided by sqrt(29), which is the answer. Therefore, the distance is (6\u221a22)/\u221a29. But maybe it's better to leave it as 6\u221a(22/29), but generally, it's rationalized. So 6\u221a(22*29)/29=6\u221a638/29. Therefore, the answer is 6\u221a638\u204429.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product components. Let me check again. AP=(2,2,6), v=(2,-3,4). Cross product:\n\ni component: (2)(4) - (6)(-3)=8+18=26\n\nj component: (6)(2) - (2)(4)=12-8=4. But in cross product, j component is subtracted. Wait, no. The cross product formula is:\n\ni*(a2b3 -a3b2) - j*(a1b3 -a3b1) +k*(a1b2 -a2b1). So the j component is -(a1b3 -a3b1). So for AP \u00d7 v:\n\nj component is -(2*4 -6*2)= -(8-12)= -(-4)=4. So cross product is (26,4,-10). So yes, that's correct. Then the magnitude is sqrt(26\u00b2 +4\u00b2 + (-10)^2)=sqrt(792). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is that the shortest distance is 6\u221a22 / sqrt(29), which is equivalent to 6\u221a(22*29)/29 =6\u221a638/29. Therefore, the answer is 6\u221a638\u204429. Let me check for any arithmetic errors once more. The calculation seems correct. So I think that's the answer.",
