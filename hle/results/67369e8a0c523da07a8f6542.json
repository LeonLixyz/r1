  "question": "What was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"What was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen?\" Hmm, first, I need to recall which movies have won Best Picture and which ones feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nWait, Luxor Obelisks... the most famous ones are probably the ones in Paris, London, New York, or Rome. Wait, Luxor Obelisks are originally from Egypt, right? So the ones in other cities are the ones taken from Luxor. For example, Cleopatra's Needle in London and New York, and the one in Paris at Place de la Concorde. So if a movie shows any of those obelisks, that's a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nSo the question is asking for the first Best Picture winner that showed one of these on screen. Let's think about Best Picture winners from the early years of the Oscars. The first Academy Awards were in 1929, so the first Best Picture was Wings (1927). But that's a war film, probably not featuring an obelisk.\n\nThen in the 1930s, movies like All Quiet on the Western Front, Cimarron, Grand Hotel... Hmm, not sure. Moving forward. Maybe a film set in Egypt? But Cleopatra (1963) wasn't a Best Picture winner. How about The Ten Commandments (1956)? That was a big epic, but didn't win Best Picture. The Best Picture that year was Around the World in 80 Days. Wait, does that movie have any scenes in Egypt? Possibly, since it's about traveling around the world. If they show Egypt, maybe the obelisk. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe a film set in Paris that includes the Place de la Concorde obelisk. For example, An American in Paris (1951) won Best Picture. Does that movie have scenes showing the obelisk? I'm not sure. Or maybe Midnight Cowboy (1969), but that's set in New York. Wait, the obelisk in New York's Central Park is Cleopatra's Needle. So if a movie set in New York shows that, it counts. Midnight Cowboy didn't win until 1969, but what about earlier films?\n\nWait, let's think of movies that feature Paris. The obelisk at Place de la Concorde is a prominent landmark. Maybe a film like Casablanca (1942), which won Best Picture in 1943. But Casablanca is set in Morocco, so probably not showing Paris. How about Gigi (1958), which won Best Picture. It's set in Paris, so maybe includes the obelisk. But I don't recall specific scenes. Alternatively, The Lost Weekend (1945), set in New York. Hmm.\n\nWait, another angle: the obelisk in Cleopatra's Needle in New York was installed in 1881. So any movie set in New York after that could show it. The one in Paris was erected in 1836. So films set in Paris after that time might include it. \n\nWait, think of the movie \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956). The story involves traveling to various locations. Maybe the part in Egypt would show the original Luxor Temple with obelisks, but the question is about the Luxor Obelisk, which are the ones moved to other cities. Wait, but maybe the film shows the original ones in Egypt. If the movie has scenes in Egypt, maybe depicting the Luxor Temple, which has obelisks. But the question specifies \"depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\" Wait, Luxor Obelisks are the ones from the Temple of Luxor, which were moved. So if the film shows one of those relocated obelisks (like in Paris, London, NYC), that's what counts. Or does showing the original in Luxor also count? The question isn't clear. But maybe the key is that the obelisk shown is one of the actual Luxor Obelisks that were transported, so if a movie shows, say, the Place de la Concorde in Paris, which has the obelisk, then that's a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nSo which Best Picture winners have scenes in Paris that include Place de la Concorde? Let's see. An American in Paris (1951) is set in Paris. The film includes several Parisian landmarks. The climax is a ballet sequence that's stylized, but maybe includes real locations. If Place de la Concorde is shown, then the obelisk would be there. Alternatively, the 1956 Around the World in 80 Days: when they go through Paris, maybe. But that film is a travelogue, so perhaps includes various landmarks. If they show the obelisk in Paris, then that would be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more recent film. The French Connection (1971) won Best Picture. It's set in New York, but I don't know if it shows the obelisk in Central Park. Taxi Driver (1976) didn't win. Midnight Cowboy is set in NYC but not sure about the obelisk.\n\nWait, another thought: the obelisk in Washington Monument is inspired by Egyptian obelisks, but it's not a Luxor Obelisk. So that's irrelevant.\n\nWait, maybe the first film to show a Luxor Obelisk on screen as part of the story is The Ten Commandments (1956), but that didn't win Best Picture. The Best Picture that year was Around the World in 80 Days. Alternatively, maybe the 1935 film Mutiny on the Bounty, which won Best Picture. But that's set on a ship in the Pacific, so no obelisks.\n\nWait, let me check some famous movies. The 1932 film Grand Hotel won Best Picture. That's set in Berlin, probably no obelisks. Casablanca, as mentioned. Going My Way (1944) is set in New York. Maybe shows Central Park, but Cleopatra's Needle is in Central Park, so maybe a scene there. But I don't recall if that's in the movie.\n\nAlternatively, maybe On the Waterfront (1954). Set in New Jersey, not likely. How about Marty (1955)? Set in the Bronx, probably not. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) is set in Thailand, no. Gigi (1958) in Paris. Maybe the obelisk is in there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe The Greatest Show on Earth (1952), a circus movie. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: look up which Best Picture winners have scenes featuring famous obelisks. For example, The French Connection (1971) has a famous car chase scene in New York. If they pass by Central Park's Cleopatra's Needle, that could be it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, West Side Story (1961), set in NYC. But again, not certain.\n\nAlternatively, Midnight Cowboy (1969) has scenes in NYC. Maybe shows the obelisk. But which came first?\n\nWait, the Luxor Obelisk in Paris is at Place de la Concorde. An American in Paris (1951) is a musical that showcases Paris. So maybe in one of the scenes, the obelisk is visible. If that's the case, then An American in Paris would be the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk. But did it win Best Picture? Yes, it won in 1952. So if that movie shows the obelisk, then that's the answer. But I need to confirm whether that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, Around the World in 80 Days (1956) has a segment in Paris. The film includes a hot air balloon scene, perhaps over Paris, which might show landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Place de la Concorde with the obelisk. If so, then that would be the first. But which of these two movies came first? An American in Paris is 1951, Around the World in 80 Days is 1956. So if An American in Paris shows the obelisk, it would be earlier.\n\nBut how to verify this without watching the movies? Maybe look up An American in Paris's scenes. The film's climax is a 17-minute ballet sequence that includes various Parisian settings. Place de la Concorde might be part of that. If the obelisk is there, then that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the opening scenes show Paris with the obelisk.\n\nAlternatively, think of even earlier films. All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) is set during WWI in Europe; maybe not. How about The Great Ziegfeld (1936)? Unlikely. Going My Way (1944) as mentioned. \n\nAnother angle: The first movie to feature a Luxor Obelisk (any of them) would need to be set in Paris, London, or New York. The Paris obelisk was erected in 1836, so films set in Paris after that. An American in Paris is a likely candidate. If that's the case, then An American in Paris (1951) would be the answer. But I need to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first time a Luxor Obelisk was shown in a Best Picture winner is in Midnight Cowboy (1969), but that's later. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think. The obelisk in Paris is at Place de la Concorde, a major landmark. If a film shows that square, the obelisk is right in the center. So in An American in Paris, during the ballet, they might have a stylized version of Parisian landmarks. But does it include the actual obelisk? Another thought: the 1951 film An American in Paris features a scene where they are by the Seine, maybe showing the Place de la Concorde. Alternatively, maybe Gigi (1958), set in Paris, which won Best Picture, might show the obelisk. But Gigi is later than An American in Paris.\n\nIf An American in Paris (1951) is the first, that's the answer. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe no Best Picture winner before a certain year depicted it, and the first was The French Connection (1971). But I don't recall that film showing the obelisk.\n\nAlternatively, Wings (1927), the first Best Picture winner, is a war film set in France. Does it show any Parisian landmarks? Possibly, but it's a silent film, maybe not focusing on landmarks.\n\nAlternatively, check the Luxor Obelisk's appearances in films. According to some sources, the obelisk in Place de la Concorde has been featured in several films. If An American in Paris includes it, then that's the answer. But if not, maybe another film.\n\nAlternatively, the film Cleopatra (1963) includes the obelisks in Egypt, but it's not a Best Picture winner.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is \"The Lost Weekend\" (1945), which is set in New York. If there's a scene in Central Park near Cleopatra's Needle, that could be it. But I'm not sure. The Lost Weekend is about alcoholism, and the main character wanders around New York. Maybe he passes by the obelisk. If that's depicted in the film, then it would be the first. But again, I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, On the Town (1949) is a musical set in New York, but it didn't win Best Picture. So no.\n\nLet me try to recall. The first movie that comes to mind with a clear depiction of a Luxor Obelisk in a Best Picture winner is The French Connection, but that's 1971. But maybe an earlier one.\n\nAlternatively, Around the World in 80 Days (1956) includes a scene in Egypt where they might show the original Luxor Temple with obelisks. But those are not the relocated Luxor Obelisks. The question says \"depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen\". So if the film shows an obelisk from Luxor, even if it's still in Egypt (like at the Temple of Luxor), does that count? The Luxor Obelisk in Paris is one of a pair; the other is still in Luxor. But perhaps the question refers to any obelisk originally from Luxor, regardless of current location. But the ones in Paris, London, and NYC are the ones called Luxor Obelisks. So if a film shows the one in Paris, that's a Luxor Obelisk. If a film shows the original in Egypt, maybe that's also a Luxor Obelisk. The question isn't specific. So the answer could vary based on that.\n\nAssuming the question means any obelisk from Luxor, including those still in Egypt, then a film with scenes in Egypt showing the originals would count. But if it means the ones relocated to other cities, then need to look for films showing those.\n\nIf we go with the relocated ones, then the first Best Picture winner to show such an obelisk would be the earliest film that includes Paris's Place de la Concorde, London's Cleopatra's Needle, or NYC's. \n\nSo back to An American in Paris (1951). If that film shows the Place de la Concorde with the obelisk, then that's the answer. If not, maybe Gigi (1958) which is set in Paris and might show it. \n\nAlternatively, check historical records. Maybe the answer is known. For example, some sources state that the first film to feature the Luxor Obelisk in Paris is An American in Paris. But since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on my memory.\n\nAnother angle: the Luxor Obelisk in Paris is a major landmark. Films set in Paris often include it. An American in Paris, being a musical that's a love letter to Paris, would likely include famous landmarks. The ballet sequence is stylized, but might include elements of Parisian architecture. If the obelisk is depicted there, even in a stylized way, that counts.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then the answer is An American in Paris (1951). But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, Around the World in 80 Days (1956) might have a scene in Paris showing the obelisk. But since Around the World in 80 Days came after An American in Paris, the latter would still be first.\n\nGiven all this, I think the answer is An American in Paris, but I'm not 100% sure. My confidence is around 70%, because while I'm reasoning through the likely candidates, I can't be certain without checking the actual films.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is *An American in Paris* (1951). The Luxor Obelisk at Place de la Concorde in Paris is a prominent landmark, and the film, set in Paris, prominently features stylized Parisian settings and landmarks. While the exact inclusion of the obelisk in scenes isn't universally confirmed, the movie's focus on Parisian iconography makes it the most plausible early candidate among Best Picture winners. Earlier winners like *Wings* (1927) or *Casablanca* (1943) lack clear ties to the obelisks, and later films like *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) postdate *An American in Paris*.  \n\nAnswer: An American in Paris  \nConfidence: 70%",
