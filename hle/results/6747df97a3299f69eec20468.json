  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question asks for the number of stable equilibria (m) of the differential equation x'(t) = -x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - x, and then to compute m - 2^4048. Alright, first things first: finding the equilibria and determining their stability.\n\nSo, equilibrium points occur where x'(t) = 0. Let's set the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n\n-x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - x = 0.\n\nI can factor this equation. Let's factor out a -x first:\n\n- x(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) = 0.\n\nWait, the quadratic inside the parentheses is x\u00b2 - 2x + 1, which factors further into (x - 1)^2. So the equation becomes:\n\n- x (x - 1)^2 = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the equilibrium points: x = 0 and x = 1 (with multiplicity 2). So there are two equilibrium points: x=0 and x=1. But wait, actually, since (x - 1)^2 is squared, does that affect the number of equilibria? No, because even though it's a double root, it's still just x=1 as the equilibrium. So the equilibria are at x=0 and x=1.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of each equilibrium. For that, I'll use the first derivative test. Let me find f(x) = x'(t) = -x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - x. The derivative f'(x) will help determine stability.\n\nCompute f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [-x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - x] = -3x\u00b2 + 4x - 1.\n\nNow evaluate f'(x) at each equilibrium point.\n\nFirst, at x=0:\n\nf'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1. Since this is negative, the equilibrium at x=0 is a stable node because the derivative is negative. So x=0 is stable.\n\nNext, at x=1:\n\nf'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 -1 = 0. Hmm, the derivative here is zero, which means the linearization is inconclusive. So we can't determine stability just by looking at the first derivative. We need another method for x=1.\n\nWhen the first derivative is zero, the equilibrium might be a higher-order critical point. To analyze the stability, we can look at the sign of f(x) around x=1. Let's consider values slightly less than 1 and slightly more than 1.\n\nTake x = 0.9 (left of 1):\n\nf(0.9) = - (0.9)^3 + 2*(0.9)^2 - 0.9\nCalculate each term:\n-0.729 + 2*(0.81) - 0.9\n= -0.729 + 1.62 - 0.9\n= (1.62 - 0.729) - 0.9\n= 0.891 - 0.9 = -0.009.\n\nSo f(0.9) is negative. Now for x=1.1 (right of 1):\n\nf(1.1) = - (1.331) + 2*(1.21) - 1.1\n= -1.331 + 2.42 -1.1\n= (2.42 -1.331) -1.1\n= 1.089 -1.1 = -0.011.\n\nSo f(x) is negative on both sides of x=1. Wait, that's interesting. If the derivative is zero and the function doesn't change sign, does that mean it's a point of inflection? Wait, but f(x) here is the rate of change of x. If near x=1, the value of f(x) is negative both to the left and right, then the flow is towards decreasing x on both sides. So if you approach x=1 from the left (x < 1), since f(x) is negative, x decreases, moving away from 1 towards 0. If you approach from the right (x >1), f(x) is also negative, so x decreases towards 1. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. If to the right of 1, x is decreasing, so moving towards 1. To the left of 1 (but close to 1), x is decreasing, moving towards 0. So the flow near x=1 is: if you're slightly above 1, you move down towards 1; if you're slightly below 1, you move down towards 0. So x=1 is a semi-stable equilibrium? Because from above, it's attracting, but from below, it's repelling? Wait, no, wait: when x is just below 1, say 0.9, f(x) is -0.009, which means x is decreasing. So moving left from near 1 towards 0. But wait, if x is decreasing when you're at x=0.9, then x is moving towards lower values, so towards 0. So at x=0.9, the derivative is negative, so x(t) is going to decrease, moving away from 1. But when x is just above 1, like 1.1, the derivative is also negative, so x decreases towards 1. So from above 1, the flow is towards 1, but from below 1, the flow is away from 1 towards 0. Therefore, the equilibrium at x=1 is a semi-stable (or half-stable) equilibrium. However, the problem asks for stable equilibria. Since from one side (right) it's attracting, but from the left it's repelling, x=1 is not a stable equilibrium. So only x=0 is a stable equilibrium. Therefore, m=1.\n\nWait, but let me verify once more. Another approach could be to consider the graph of f(x) = -x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - x. Let's sketch it mentally. The cubic function: leading term is -x\u00b3, so as x approaches +infty, f(x) approaches -infty, and as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty. The roots are at x=0 and x=1 (double root). So the graph crosses the x-axis at x=0 and touches at x=1 (since it's a double root). So the graph would look like: starting from top left (since as x\u2192-infty, f(x) goes to +infty), crosses the x-axis at 0, then turns around. At x=1, since it's a double root, the graph touches the x-axis here. The behavior around x=1: to the left of 1, say x=0.5, let's compute f(0.5):\n\nf(0.5) = - (0.125) + 2*(0.25) - 0.5 = -0.125 + 0.5 - 0.5 = -0.125. So negative. At x=1.5:\n\nf(1.5) = - (3.375) + 2*(2.25) -1.5 = -3.375 +4.5 -1.5 = (-3.375 -1.5) +4.5 = -4.875 +4.5 = -0.375. Still negative. Hmm. Wait, but that's at x=1.5. Wait, maybe between 0 and 1, let's see. Wait, the function f(x) is -x^3 +2x\u00b2 -x. Let's see, between x=0 and x=1, let's pick x=0.5. We saw f(0.5)=-0.125. At x=0, f(x)=0. At x=1, f(x)=0. So the graph from x=0 to x=1: starts at 0, goes down to some negative minimum, then comes back to 0 at x=1. But since at x=0.5, it's negative, so the graph is below the x-axis between 0 and 1. So the flow (direction of x(t)) is negative there, meaning x(t) is decreasing. So between 0 and 1, x decreases, moving towards 0. To the right of x=1, the function is also negative (as seen at x=1.5). So to the right of 1, x decreases towards 1. So at x=1, if you're slightly to the right, you move left towards 1; if you're slightly to the left (in 0 < x <1), you move left towards 0. Therefore, the equilibrium at x=1 is stable from the right (higher side) but unstable from the left. Hence, it's a semi-stable equilibrium. But the problem is asking for the number of stable equilibria. Since stability typically requires being stable from both sides (asymptotically stable), then x=1 isn't a stable equilibrium. Only x=0 is a stable equilibrium. Therefore, m=1.\n\nThen, the question asks for m - 2^4048. Since 2^4048 is a very large number, but m is 1, so 1 minus a huge number is negative, but specifically, 1 - 2^4048. But given the answer is likely to be in terms of m - 2^4048, but since m=1, the answer is 1 - 2^4048, which is a negative number, but perhaps they just want that expression as the answer. Since 2^4048 is already written in the problem, so the answer would be 1 - 2^4048. However, in the problem statement, the user might have a typo or formatting issue. Wait, original problem: \"Find m - 2^{4048}\". So the answer is m (which is 1) minus 2^4048, so 1 - 2^4048.\n\nBut the problem is presented in Chinese? Wait, no\u2014the user wrote the problem in English. Wait, the user's instruction is \"You will be given a question...\" So as per the problem statement, the answer is 1 - 2^4048, which would be a huge negative number. However, the answer options aren't given here; the problem is direct. Wait, but in the original problem setup, perhaps there was a typo, but the user says \"Find m - 2^{4048}\". Therefore, we compute m as 1, so the answer is 1 - 2^{4048}. But since 2^{4048} is an extremely large number, the result is negative. However, the problem might be expecting m to be 2, which would make m - 2^4048 = 2 - 2^4048. But according to my analysis, m=1.\n\nWait, let me double-check the stability. For x=0, f'(0) = -1 <0 \u21d2 stable. For x=1, f'(1)=0. Then, testing the sign around x=1: to the left (x=0.9), f(x) is negative (so x decreases, moving away from 1 towards 0); to the right (x=1.1), f(x) is negative (so x decreases towards 1). Wait, but if f(x) is negative at x=1.1, that means dx/dt is negative, so x is decreasing, moving to the left (towards 1). So from the right side, approaching 1. From the left side, since f(x) is negative, x is decreasing (moving left away from 1). Therefore, for x=1, trajectories from the right approach 1, but from the left, they move away. Therefore, x=1 is a semi-stable equilibrium, which is not considered a stable equilibrium in the strict sense. Hence, m=1. So the answer is 1 - 2^4048. But the problem says \"Find m - 2^{4048}\", so the answer is just that expression. Unless there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the number of stable equilibria. Let me check again. Maybe I missed another equilibrium? The equation was -x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 -x =0. We factored it as -x(x-1)^2=0. So roots at x=0 and x=1 (double root). So only two equilibria. One at x=0 (stable), one at x=1 (semi-stable). So indeed, only one stable equilibrium. Therefore, m=1. Hence, 1 - 2^4048 is the result.\n\nBut wait, 2^4048 is 2 raised to a very large exponent. The problem might be a trick question where m is 1, and 2^4048 is meant to be a red herring, leading to 1 - 2^4048 as the answer, which is a negative number. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects m to be 2, but that would require both equilibria to be stable, which they aren't. Wait, no. x=1 is semi-stable, not stable. So m=1. Hence, the answer should be 1 - 2^4048. However, if the problem had asked for the number of equilibria (which is 2) minus 2^4048, but no, it specifically says m is the number of stable equilibria.\n\nThus, the final answer is 1 - 2^4048. But the problem may have a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the stability. Let me verify once more.\n\nTake x just above 1, say 1.1. f(1.1) is negative, so x decreases, moving towards 1. Hence, from the right, it's stable. From the left (x=0.9), f(x) is negative, so x decreases, moving away from 1 towards 0. Thus, x=1 is attracting from the right and repelling from the left. Therefore, it's a semi-stable equilibrium. In standard terminology, a stable equilibrium requires that trajectories from both sides approach it. Since x=1 doesn't satisfy that, it's not considered a stable equilibrium. Therefore, m=1.\n\nThus, the answer is 1 - 2^4048. But since the problem is presented as a math problem, the answer would be expressed as 1 minus 2 to the 4048th power, written as 1 - 2^{4048}. Therefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{1 - 2^{4048}}.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To find the number of stable equilibria (m) for the differential equation \\( x'(t) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x \\), we first determine the equilibria by solving \\( -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 \\).

The question asks for the number of stable equilibria (m) of the differential equation x'(t) = -x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - x, and then to compute m - 2^4048. Alright, first things first: finding the equilibria and determining their stability.\n\nSo, equilibrium points occur where x'(t) = 0. Let's set the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n\n-x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - x = 0.\n\nI can factor this equation. Let's factor out a -x first:\n\n- x(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1) = 0.\n\nWait, the quadratic inside the parentheses is x\u00b2 - 2x + 1, which factors further into (x - 1)^2. So the equation becomes:\n\n- x (x - 1)^2 = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the equilibrium points: x = 0 and x = 1 (with multiplicity 2). So there are two equilibrium points: x=0 and x=1. But wait, actually, since (x - 1)^2 is squared, does that affect the number of equilibria? No, because even though it's a double root, it's still just x=1 as the equilibrium. So the equilibria are at x=0 and x=1.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of each equilibrium.

Since this is negative, the equilibrium at x=0 is a stable node because the derivative is negative. So x=0 is stable.\n\nNext, at x=1:\n\nf'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 -1 = 0. Hmm, the derivative here is zero, which means the linearization is inconclusive. So we can't determine stability just by looking at the first derivative.

Let's consider values slightly less than 1 and slightly more than 1.\n\nTake x = 0.9 (left of 1):\n\nf(0.9) = - (0.9)^3 + 2*(0.9)^2 - 0.9\nCalculate each term:\n-0.729 + 2*(0.81) - 0.9\n= -0.729 + 1.62 - 0.9\n= (1.62 - 0.729) - 0.9\n= 0.891 - 0.9 = -0.009.\n\nSo f(0.9) is negative. Now for x=1.1 (right of 1):\n\nf(1.1) = - (1.331) + 2*(1.21) - 1.1\n= -1.331 + 2.42 -1.1\n= (2.42 -1.331) -1.1\n= 1.089 -1.1 = -0.011.\n\nSo f(x) is negative on both sides of x=1. Wait, that's interesting. If the derivative is zero and the function doesn't change sign, does that mean it's a point of inflection? Wait, but f(x) here is the rate of change of x. If near x=1, the value of f(x) is negative both to the left and right, then the flow is towards decreasing x on both sides. So if you approach x=1 from the left (x < 1), since f(x) is negative, x decreases, moving away from 1 towards 0. If you approach from the right (x >1), f(x) is also negative, so x decreases towards 1. Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. If to the right of 1, x is decreasing, so moving towards 1. To the left of 1 (but close to 1), x is decreasing, moving towards 0. So the flow near x=1 is: if you're slightly above 1, you move down towards 1; if you're slightly below 1, you move down towards 0. So x=1 is a semi-stable equilibrium?

The behavior around x=1: to the left of 1, say x=0.5, let's compute f(0.5):\n\nf(0.5) = - (0.125) + 2*(0.25) - 0.5 = -0.125 + 0.5 - 0.5 = -0.125. So negative. At x=1.5:\n\nf(1.5) = - (3.375) + 2*(2.25) -1.5 = -3.375 +4.5 -1.5 = (-3.375 -1.5) +4.5 = -4.875 +4.5 = -0.375. Still negative. Hmm. Wait, but that's at x=1.5. Wait, maybe between 0 and 1, let's see. Wait, the function f(x) is -x^3 +2x\u00b2 -x. Let's see, between x=0 and x=1, let's pick x=0.5. We saw f(0.5)=-0.125. At x=0, f(x)=0. At x=1, f(x)=0. So the graph from x=0 to x=1: starts at 0, goes down to some negative minimum, then comes back to 0 at x=1. But since at x=0.5, it's negative, so the graph is below the x-axis between 0 and 1.
