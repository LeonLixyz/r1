  "question": "Consider the initial value problem:\n$$\nx'(t)=(t-1)\\cdot x^2(t),\n$$\nwith $x(0)=-8$. Find $x(1)$.",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this initial value problem. The equation is x'(t) = (t - 1) * x\u00b2(t), and the initial condition is x(0) = -8. I have to find x(1). Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, this looks like a separable differential equation. Right? Because the derivative of x with respect to t is equal to some function of t multiplied by a function of x. So I can separate the variables and integrate both sides. Let me recall the method for separable equations.\n\nSo, the equation is dx/dt = (t - 1)x\u00b2. To separate variables, I can divide both sides by x\u00b2 and multiply by dt, which gives dx/x\u00b2 = (t - 1) dt. Then, integrate both sides. The left side integral is \u222b (1/x\u00b2) dx, which is \u222b x^(-2) dx. That should integrate to -x^(-1) + C, right? Because the integral of x^n is x^(n+1)/(n+1), so here n = -2, so it becomes x^(-1)/(-1) + C, which is -1/x + C. \n\nOn the right side, the integral of (t - 1) dt. Let's compute that. Split it into \u222b t dt - \u222b 1 dt. The integral of t dt is (1/2)t\u00b2, and the integral of 1 dt is t. So overall, (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + C. \n\nPutting it all together, integrating both sides gives:\n\n-1/x = (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + C.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition x(0) = -8 to find C. Let's plug t = 0 and x = -8 into the equation.\n\nLeft side: -1/(-8) = 1/8.\n\nRight side: (1/2)(0)^2 - 0 + C = C.\n\nSo 1/8 = C. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n-1/x = (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + 1/8.\n\nNow, solve for x. Let's rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by -1:\n\n1/x = -[(1/2)t\u00b2 - t + 1/8] = - (1/2)t\u00b2 + t - 1/8.\n\nTherefore, x(t) = 1 / [ - (1/2)t\u00b2 + t - 1/8 ].\n\nSimplify the denominator. Let's write it as a fraction to combine terms. The denominator is:\n\n- (1/2)t\u00b2 + t - 1/8. Let me combine the terms. Let's write each term with denominator 8 to make it easier:\n\n- (4/8)t\u00b2 + (8/8)t - 1/8 = [ -4t\u00b2 + 8t - 1 ] / 8.\n\nSo, x(t) = 1 / [ (-4t\u00b2 + 8t -1)/8 ] = 8 / (-4t\u00b2 +8t -1).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator. Factor out a -1 from denominator:\n\nDenominator: -4t\u00b2 +8t -1 = - (4t\u00b2 -8t +1). Therefore, x(t) = 8 / [ - (4t\u00b2 -8t +1) ] = -8 / (4t\u00b2 -8t +1).\n\nSo x(t) = -8 / (4t\u00b2 -8t +1). Now, we need to find x(1). Plug t = 1 into this expression.\n\nCompute the denominator: 4(1)^2 -8(1) +1 = 4*1 -8 +1 = 4 -8 +1 = -3. So denominator is -3.\n\nThen, x(1) = -8 / (-3) = 8/3. Wait, that's positive 8/3. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLet's retrace. The integral of dx/x\u00b2 is -1/x + C. The integral of (t-1)dt is (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + C. Correct. Then plugging in x(0)=-8 gives 1/8 = C. Then the equation is -1/x = (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + 1/8. Solving for x gives x = -1 / [ (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + 1/8 ]. Then rewriting the denominator as (4t\u00b2 -8t +1)/8, so the reciprocal is 8/(4t\u00b2 -8t +1), multiplied by -1 gives x = -8/(4t\u00b2 -8t +1). Then at t=1, denominator is 4(1) -8(1) +1 = -3. So x(1) = -8/(-3) = 8/3. That seems right.\n\nWait a second, but 4(1)^2 is 4, minus 8(1) is -8, plus 1 is -3. Yes. So denominator is -3, so -8 divided by -3 is 8/3. So x(1) is 8/3. But let me check if there's any possible miscalculation in the steps. Maybe when combining terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the denominator again step by step. Original expression after integration: (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + 1/8. Let's evaluate that at t=1. So (1/2)(1)^2 -1 +1/8 = (1/2) -1 +1/8 = (-1/2) +1/8 = (-4/8 +1/8) = -3/8. So denominator is -3/8. Then x(1) is -1 divided by (-3/8) = 8/3. Exactly. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 8/3, which is approximately 2.666..., but written as a fraction. So, the final answer is 8/3. Wait, but the problem says x(0)=-8, and we ended up with x(1) =8/3. Let me check if anywhere I flipped a sign. Let's go through the steps again.\n\nStarting from dx/dt = (t-1)x\u00b2. Separation gives dx/x\u00b2 = (t-1)dt. Integrate both sides: left is \u222bx^{-2}dx = -x^{-1} + C. Right is \u222b(t-1)dt = (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + C. So yes, equations are correct. Then applying x(0) = -8. Plug into -1/x = (1/2)t\u00b2 - t + C. At t=0, x=-8. So -1/(-8) = 1/8 = (1/2)(0)^2 -0 + C => C=1/8. Correct. Then equation is -1/x = (1/2)t\u00b2 - t +1/8. Solving for x gives x= -1/[ (1/2)t\u00b2 -t +1/8 ]. Then rearranged denominator as (4t\u00b2 -8t +1)/8, so x= -8/(4t\u00b2 -8t +1). At t=1, denominator is 4-8+1= -3, so x(1)= -8/-3=8/3. All steps check out. So the answer is 8/3. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes here. So confidence is high here. Maybe 100%? Well, unless I made some arithmetic error. Let's check the denominator once more. For t=1:\n\n4t\u00b2 -8t +1 = 4*1 -8*1 +1 = 4 -8 +1= -3. Yes. So denominator is -3. Then x(1)= -8 / (-3) = 8/3. Yep. That's correct.\n",
