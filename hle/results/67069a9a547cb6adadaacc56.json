  "question": "In The Simpsons Season 6,  Episode 12, \"Homer the Great\", Homer Simpson chases someone wearing a costume down a corridor. What kind of costume is it?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this. The question is asking about The Simpsons Season 6, Episode 12, titled \"Homer the Great.\" Specifically, it's about a scene where Homer chases someone wearing a costume down a corridor. I need to figure out what kind of costume that was.\n\nFirst, I remember that \"Homer the Great\" is the episode where Homer joins the Stonecutters, a secret society. The Stonecutters are a parody of groups like the Freemasons. The episode is famous for the song \"We Do\" which lists all the things the Stonecutters supposedly control.\n\nNow, in the episode, there's a part where the Stonecutters' leader, Number One, is revealed. After some conflict, Homer becomes the leader because he has the Stonecutter's sacred birthmark (which turns out to be a tattoo from a drunken night). But before that, there's a scene where someone in a costume is chased. Wait, the person being chased might be the guy dressed as the devil. Because when the Stonecutters are having their meeting, there's a guy in a red devil costume who does pranks or something. Homer chases him down the corridor when he's trying to get away. \n\nAlternatively, I might be mixing it up with another episode. Let me try to recall. The devil costume is part of the initiation or their rituals. The person in the devil costume is causing trouble, and Homer, as part of taking charge, goes after him. So the costume is a devil costume. \n\nI'm pretty confident because that's a memorable scene. The devil character is a recurring gag in that episode. Another possibility is a gorilla costume, but I don't think so. No, the devil is more specific to the Stonecutters' imagery. The Stonecutters have some occult-like symbols, so a devil costume makes sense. \n\nSo the answer should be a devil costume. Let me double-check. The episode's plot involves Homer taking over the Stonecutters, and during the events, the previous leader (Number One) is ousted. The chase scene might involve the devil mascot they have. Yes, in the Stonecutters' lodge, they have a guy in a devil costume who they use for pranks, and Homer chases him. Yeah, that's right.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: In \"Homer the Great\" (Season 6, Episode 12), Homer pursues a member of the Stonecutters who wears a red devil costume. The Stonecutters use this character as part of their rituals and antics, and the chase occurs when Homer confronts the group's corruption. The devil costume is integral to the Stonecutters' imagery in the episode.  \nAnswer: A devil costume  \nConfidence: 95%",
