  "question": "Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The user is asking which year Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.\n\nFirst, I need to remember who Goodluck Jonathan is. He was the President of Nigeria, serving from 2010 to 2015. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. The middle name Azikiwe is significant because it's part of his name, but the question is about when he publicly identified himself with that name. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as when he \"publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.\" That sounds a bit odd because Azikiwe is part of his full name already. Maybe the question refers to when he started using the Azikiwe name more prominently or acknowledged it publicly. \n\nAzikiwe is a notable name in Nigerian history. Nnamdi Azikiwe was the first President of Nigeria. Perhaps Goodluck Jonathan added Azikiwe to his name in honor of him. So, when did that happen?\n\nI recall that Goodluck Jonathan's full name includes Ebele Azikiwe. But when did he start using Azikiwe publicly? From what I remember, Goodluck Jonathan was Vice President under Umaru Yar'Adua, and became President in 2010 after Yar'Adua's death. I think he has had the name Azikiwe all along, as part of his given name. \n\nWait, maybe there was a specific event where he emphasized his middle name Azikiwe. For example, during his political campaigns or when he assumed a higher office. Alternatively, perhaps when he became president, he started using the full name including Azikiwe more formally. \n\nLooking up some sources, his full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. The middle name \"Azikiwe\" was given to him at birth, honoring Nnamdi Azikiwe. So, he's had that name since birth. Therefore, he didn't \"publicly identify\" himself as Azikiwe in a particular year; it's part of his legal name. The question might be based on a misunderstanding. \n\nBut the question is phrased as when he publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. If he's always had that name, perhaps the answer is that he didn't have to publicly identify himself as such in a specific year. However, maybe there's a specific instance where he emphasized that part of his name. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user confused Azikiwe with another name. Without more context, it's tricky. But considering available information, since his full name includes Azikiwe from birth, there's no specific year when he started using it publicly. Therefore, the answer might be that he didn't publicly identify himself as Azikiwe in a particular year because it was always part of his name.\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan has had \"Azikiwe\" as part of his legal name since birth, in honor of Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe. There is no documented instance of him \"publicly identifying\" as Azikiwe in a specific year, as the name was already inherent to his identity. The phrasing of the question may stem from a misunderstanding of his full name.\n\nAnswer: None (Azikiwe has always been part of his legal name)  \nConfidence: 95%",
