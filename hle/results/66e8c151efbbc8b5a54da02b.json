  "question": "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. What is the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$? ",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out the rank of the third homotopy group \u03c0\u2083(X) for a smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP\u00b3. Hmm, first, I need to recall some algebraic topology and differential geometry concepts. \n\nA quintic hypersurface in CP\u00b3 is defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5. Since it's smooth, it's a complex manifold of dimension 2, right? Because CP\u00b3 is 3-dimensional, and a hypersurface would have dimension one less, so 2. Wait, but CP\u00b3 is complex projective 3-space, so a hypersurface there would indeed be a complex 2-dimensional manifold, which is a 4-real-dimensional manifold. So X is a K\u00e4hler manifold, being a smooth projective variety.\n\nNow, the question is about the third homotopy group. Homotopy groups are tricky, especially higher ones. I remember that for simply connected spaces, Hurewicz theorem relates homotopy groups to homology groups. The Hurewicz theorem states that if a space is (n-1)-connected, then the first non-trivial homotopy group is isomorphic to the homology group in the same dimension. But here, X is a 4-real-dimensional manifold. So let's think about the connectivity of X.\n\nSince X is a smooth projective variety, it's simply connected. Because all smooth projective hypersurfaces in CP\u207f are simply connected, right? For example, in the case of a complex curve (Riemann surface), they are simply connected if the genus is zero, but higher genus would have nontrivial \u03c0\u2081. But in higher dimensions, like a hypersurface in CP\u00b3 (which is a surface in complex dimension 2), I think they are simply connected. Wait, but maybe in even dimensions, higher homotopy groups become relevant. \n\nSo, since X is simply connected, the Hurewicz theorem applies. The Hurewicz theorem in this case says that \u03c0\u2081(X) is trivial (since it's simply connected), \u03c0\u2082(X) is isomorphic to H\u2082(X; Z), and then \u03c0\u2083(X) would map to H\u2083(X; Z) under the Hurewicz homomorphism, but the exact relationship might be more complicated because the Hurewicz theorem for higher homotopy groups gives a surjection with kernel being the subgroup generated by the images of the Whitehead products. But maybe if the homology group is trivial, then the homotopy group is also trivial?\n\nWait, but I need to compute H\u2083(X; Z). Let's think about the topology of a quintic hypersurface in CP\u00b3. For complex projective hypersurfaces of degree d in CP\u207f, their homology groups can be computed using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The theorem states that for a smooth hypersurface X in CP\u207f, the inclusion map X \u2192 CP\u207f induces isomorphisms on homology groups H_k for k < dim(X). Here, X is a complex 2-dimensional manifold, so real dimension 4. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem tells us that H_k(X; Z) \u2245 H_k(CP\u00b3; Z) for k < 2 (since dim(X) as a complex manifold is 2). But CP\u00b3 has homology groups Z in even dimensions 0, 2, 4, 6, and 0 otherwise. So for X, which is a hypersurface, H\u2080(X) = Z, H\u2081(X) = 0 (since X is simply connected), H\u2082(X) would be isomorphic to H\u2082(CP\u00b3) = Z, but wait, that's only for k < dim(X). Wait, the dimension of X as a complex manifold is 2, so real dimension 4. So the theorem says that for k < 2 (i.e., k=0 and 1), H_k(X) \u2245 H_k(CP\u00b3). But H\u2081(X) is 0, which matches. For H\u2082(X), since 2 is not less than dim(X)=2, the theorem doesn't apply. So we need another approach to compute H\u2082(X) and higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Chern classes or the adjunction formula. The Euler characteristic of a hypersurface in CP\u00b3 can be computed via the formula. The Euler characteristic \u03c7(X) for a degree d hypersurface in CP\u207f is given by the coefficient of t\u207f in the expansion of (1 + t)^{n+1}/(1 + d t). Wait, no, maybe that's not the right formula. Alternatively, for a smooth hypersurface of degree d in CP\u00b3, which is a complex surface, the Euler characteristic can be computed by the formula \u03c7 = d(d - 4)^2 + 6. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the general formula for a hypersurface in CP\u207f of degree d is \u03c7 = [(d - 1)^{n+1} + (-1)^{n+1}(d(n+1) - 1)] / d. Let me check for n=3, d=5. Plugging in n=3, d=5: [(5-1)^4 + (-1)^4*(5*4 -1)] /5 = [4^4 + 1*(20 -1)]/5 = [256 +19]/5 = 275/5 =55. So \u03c7=55. \n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the Euler characteristic for a quintic threefold? Wait, but X here is a quintic in CP\u00b3, which is a surface, so real dimension 4. Let me confirm. In CP\u00b3, a hypersurface is a complex surface, so real 4-manifold. The Euler characteristic can be computed by the formula: for a hypersurface of degree d in CP\u207f, the Euler characteristic is d times the coefficient of t^{n-1} in (1 + t)^{n+1}/(1 + d t). Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, using the formula from algebraic geometry: for a smooth hypersurface X of degree d in CP^{n}, the Euler characteristic is \u03c7(X) = d * [ (d - 1)^{n} - (-1)^{n} ] / (d - 1 + 1) )? Not sure. Wait, perhaps use the Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem or Chern classes.\n\nAlternatively, for a complex surface, the Euler characteristic is equal to the sum of the Betti numbers: b\u2080 + b\u2081 + b\u2082 + b\u2083 + b\u2084. For a simply connected 4-manifold, b\u2080 = 1, b\u2084=1, and b\u2081 = b\u2083 = 0 (by Poincar\u00e9 duality). So \u03c7 = 2 + b\u2082. If we can compute \u03c7, then we can get b\u2082.\n\nFor a hypersurface in CP\u00b3 of degree d, which is a complex surface, the Euler characteristic is given by the formula \u03c7 = d^3 - 4d^2 + 6d. Wait, that seems arbitrary. Wait, maybe no. Let me refer to some standard formulas. The Euler characteristic of a hypersurface in CP\u00b3 is given by d(d - 4)^2 + 6. Wait, for example, when d=1 (a plane), then \u03c7 =1*(1-4)^2 +6= (9)+6=15. But a plane in CP\u00b3 is CP\u00b2, and its Euler characteristic is 3 (since CP\u00b2 has Betti numbers 1,0,1,0,1, so \u03c7=3). But according to that formula, it's 15, which is wrong. So that formula can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula for the Euler characteristic of a degree d hypersurface in CP\u00b3 is d(d\u00b2 -4d +6). Let's test for d=1: 1(1 -4 +6)= 3, which matches CP\u00b2. For d=2: 2(4 -8 +6)=2(2)=4. A quadric surface in CP\u00b3 is CP\u00b9\u00d7CP\u00b9, which has Euler characteristic 2\u00d72=4, so that works. For d=3: 3(9 -12 +6)=3(3)=9. A cubic surface in CP\u00b3 is a del Pezzo surface of degree 3, which has Euler characteristic 9 (since it's a blow-up of CP\u00b2 at 6 points, so \u03c7=3 +6=9). So yes, the formula seems to be \u03c7 = d(d\u00b2 -4d +6). So for a quintic (d=5), \u03c7=5*(25 -20 +6)=5*(11)=55. So \u03c7=55. \n\nSince X is a simply connected 4-manifold, \u03c7=2 + b\u2082. Therefore, 55 = 2 + b\u2082 \u21d2 b\u2082=53. So H\u2082(X; Z) is free abelian of rank 53, and H\u2083(X; Z) would be isomorphic to H^1(X; Z) by Poincar\u00e9 duality. But X is simply connected, so H\u2081(X; Z)=0, hence H^1(X)=0, so H\u2083(X; Z)=0. Therefore, H\u2083(X; Z) is zero. Then by Hurewicz theorem, since X is simply connected, \u03c0\u2082(X) \u2245 H\u2082(X; Z) = Z\u2075\u00b3. Then, \u03c0\u2083(X) would map to H\u2083(X; Z)=0 via the Hurewicz homomorphism. But the Hurewicz theorem in degree 3 says that if the space is 2-connected, then \u03c0\u2083\u2245H\u2083, but in our case, X is simply connected but \u03c0\u2082(X)=Z\u2075\u00b3 is not zero. So the Hurewicz theorem doesn't directly give \u03c0\u2083 from H\u2083, but rather there is a Hurewicz homomorphism \u03c0\u2083(X)\u2192H\u2083(X), which is surjective with kernel generated by the Whitehead products. But since H\u2083(X)=0, this would imply that \u03c0\u2083(X) is equal to the kernel, which is generated by Whitehead products. However, without knowing more about the structure, maybe \u03c0\u2083(X) is trivial? Wait, but Whitehead products are elements of \u03c0\u2083(X) formed by combining elements of \u03c0\u2082(X). If \u03c0\u2082(X) is non-trivial, then there could be non-trivial Whitehead products. But H\u2083(X) is zero, so the Hurewicz homomorphism is zero map, but the kernel is the entire \u03c0\u2083(X). So \u03c0\u2083(X) is generated by Whitehead products of elements of \u03c0\u2082(X). \n\nBut I need to determine the rank of \u03c0\u2083(X). Since we're working with homotopy groups, which are abelian for n\u22652, but wait, \u03c0\u2083 is an abelian group, right? Because higher homotopy groups are abelian. So the Whitehead products would live in the commutator, but maybe in this case, the Whitehead product [id, id] in \u03c0\u2083(X) for some element id in \u03c0\u2082(X). Wait, but Whitehead products are maps from S\u00b3 to X, constructed by mapping a 3-sphere into the union of two spheres (from \u03c0\u2082) attached at a point. But the exact structure is complicated. However, if H\u2083(X)=0, then \u03c0\u2083(X) must be a quotient of the kernel of the Hurewicz map, but since the Hurewicz map is trivial, \u03c0\u2083(X) is equal to that kernel. But I don't know how to compute this kernel. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. For a simply connected space, the rational homotopy groups \u03c0_n(X)\u2297Q can be studied using rational homotopy theory. The ranks of the homotopy groups are the same as the dimensions of the rational homotopy groups. For a simply connected space, if the cohomology ring is known, the minimal model can be constructed, and from there, the ranks of the homotopy groups can be found. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a smooth projective variety like a quintic threefold (wait, in this case, it's a quintic in CP\u00b3, so a surface), maybe we can use the fact that such a surface is of general type (since degree 5 in CP\u00b3 is when the canonical bundle is ample; the canonical bundle of a hypersurface of degree d in CP\u207f is O(d - n -1), so here n=3, so O(5 -4)=O(1), which is ample. So X is a simply connected complex surface of general type with ample canonical bundle. \n\nBut how does this help with homotopy groups? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, we can look at the Hurewicz theorem again. Since \u03c0\u2081(X)=0, \u03c0\u2082(X)=Z\u2075\u00b3, H\u2083(X)=0. So the Hurewicz map from \u03c0\u2083(X) to H\u2083(X)=0 is the zero map. Therefore, \u03c0\u2083(X) must be a group that maps surjectively to H\u2083(X)=0, which just means that \u03c0\u2083(X) is its own kernel. But this doesn't give us much. However, perhaps in this case, \u03c0\u2083(X) is entirely torsion? Or maybe it's zero?\n\nWait, for spheres, for example, S\u00b2 has \u03c0\u2083(S\u00b2)=Z (generated by the Hopf map), which is not torsion. But here, X is a 4-manifold with nontrivial \u03c0\u2082. So maybe there are nontrivial elements in \u03c0\u2083(X) coming from Whitehead products. For example, if you take two elements in \u03c0\u2082(X) and form their Whitehead product, you get an element of \u03c0\u2083(X). Since \u03c0\u2082(X) is Z\u2075\u00b3, the Whitehead product would be a bilinear map Z\u2075\u00b3 \u00d7 Z\u2075\u00b3 \u2192 \u03c0\u2083(X). But Whitehead products are anti-commutative, so [a,b] = -[b,a], and [a,a] is zero if the group is abelian. But \u03c0\u2082(X) is abelian, so [a,a] would be 2-torsion? Wait, but in \u03c0\u2083(X), which is also abelian, so the Whitehead product [a,b] would be a element in \u03c0\u2083(X). The group \u03c0\u2083(X) might be a free abelian group generated by these Whitehead products. But how many such generators are there?\n\nAlternatively, if H\u2083(X)=0, and we're working with rational coefficients, then the Hurewicz theorem with rational coefficients says that if X is simply connected, then the Hurewicz map \u03c0_n(X)\u2297Q \u2192 H_n(X; Q) is an isomorphism for the first non-zero H_n. But here, H\u2082(X; Q)=Q\u2075\u00b3, H\u2083(X; Q)=0. So the Hurewicz theorem with rational coefficients would tell us that \u03c0\u2082(X)\u2297Q \u2245 H\u2082(X; Q)=Q\u2075\u00b3, which we already know. For \u03c0\u2083(X)\u2297Q, since H\u2083(X; Q)=0, the Hurewicz map \u03c0\u2083(X)\u2297Q \u2192 H\u2083(X; Q)=0 is zero. So it doesn't give any information. However, rational homotopy theory might say that if the space is formal, then certain things hold, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this case, the higher homotopy groups can be determined via the connectivity. Since X is a 4-dimensional manifold, the homotopy groups \u03c0\u2096(X) for k\u22654 are isomorphic to \u03c0\u2096(S\u2074), but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, that's only for spheres. For example, a 4-manifold doesn't have to have the same homotopy groups as S\u2074. \n\nAlternatively, since X is a complex surface, perhaps we can use the fact that it is simply connected and has nontrivial \u03c0\u2082, but \u03c0\u2083 might be related to the topology of the embedding. But I'm stuck here. Maybe the answer is that \u03c0\u2083(X) has rank 0, because H\u2083(X; Z)=0, and under Hurewicz, since H\u2083 is zero, \u03c0\u2083 must be torsion? But wait, the question asks for the rank, which refers to the free part, i.e., the number of copies of Z in \u03c0\u2083(X). If \u03c0\u2083(X) is all torsion, then the rank is zero. But can we deduce that?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the Hurewicz map \u03c0\u2083(X) \u2192 H\u2083(X)=0 is the zero map, then \u03c0\u2083(X) is in the kernel, which could consist of torsion elements. But if \u03c0\u2083(X) has any free part, that would have to map injectively to H\u2083(X), but since H\u2083 is zero, any free part would have to vanish. So \u03c0\u2083(X) is a torsion group, hence its rank is zero. Therefore, the rank of \u03c0\u2083(X) is zero.\n",
