  "question": "How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many colors are observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus. Hmm, I remember that allotropes are different structural forms of the same element. For phosphorus, the common ones are white, red, and black. Wait, but maybe there are more? Let me think.\n\nWhite phosphorus is the most reactive and is usually a waxy solid that's white or yellowish. Then there's red phosphorus, which is more stable and used in matches. Black phosphorus is another allotrope, which I think is the least reactive and has a layered structure. Are there any others? Oh, sometimes I've heard of violet or scarlet phosphorus. Are those considered separate allotropes or variations?\n\nWait, maybe violet or scarlet phosphorus are just forms of red phosphorus? Or maybe they're distinct. Also, I recall that white phosphorus can sometimes appear yellow due to impurities, but the pure form is white. So the pure allotropes would be white, red, and black. But the question is about how many colors can be observed. So each allotrope has its own color. If violet is a separate allotrope, that adds another. But I think the main ones are three. Let me check again.\n\nFrom what I studied, the primary allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, and black. Sometimes red phosphorus might have different shades depending on the structure, but they are still considered red. So when the question says \"pure allotropes,\" maybe each pure form has a distinct color. So white (sometimes called yellow), red, and black. That would be three colors. But wait, sometimes white phosphorus is referred to as yellow because it turns yellow when exposed to light, but the pure form is white. So maybe the answer is two: white and red and black? Wait, black is another color. So three? Because white, red, and black are different colors. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me recall. White phosphorus is actually a translucent white when pure, but can turn yellow. However, in pure form, it's considered white. Red phosphorus is red, and black is black. So three colors. Therefore, the answer should be 3 colors.\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: Phosphorus has several allotropes, with the primary ones being white, red, and black. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that appears white in its pure form but may yellow slightly due to light exposure. Red phosphorus is typically a dark red powder, and black phosphorus has a layered structure with a black appearance. While variations like violet or scarlet phosphorus are mentioned in some contexts, they are generally considered forms of red phosphorus or intermediate structures. Thus, pure allotropes distinctly exhibit white, red, and black colors.  \n\nAnswer: 3  \nConfidence: 95%",
