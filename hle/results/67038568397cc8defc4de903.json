  "question": "What muscle group primarily affects knee flexion during the pre-swing phase of walking in biomechanical analyses?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about knee flexion during the pre-swing phase of walking. Hmm, the question is asking which muscle group is primarily responsible for that action.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the different phases of the gait cycle. The pre-swing phase is part of the stance phase, right? Wait, no. The gait cycle is divided into stance and swing phases. The pre-swing phase is actually the last part of the stance phase, just before the foot leaves the ground. During this phase, the body is preparing to swing the leg forward. So, knee flexion here would help in initiating the swing.\n\nNow, which muscles flex the knee? The main knee flexors are the hamstrings\u2014biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus. But wait, there's also the gastrocnemius, which is a calf muscle but crosses the knee joint and can assist in flexion. The popliteus is another one, but I think it's more involved in unlocking the knee from extension. \n\nDuring pre-swing, the leg is pushing off, so maybe the gastrocnemius is active as part of plantar flexion for push-off. But the knee flexion might be more from the hamstrings. Let me think. In the pre-swing phase, the hip is moving into flexion to start the swing, which might be driven by the iliopsoas. But the knee flexion\u2014since the foot is still on the ground but about to lift, the hamstrings would contract to bend the knee. Wait, but during late stance, the hamstrings might be acting more as hip extensors. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the phases.\n\nAlternatively, the gastrocnemius, which is active during push-off (which happens in the terminal stance/pre-swing), could cause some knee flexion as it crosses the knee. But I'm not sure if that's the primary action here. The hamstrings are definitely knee flexors, but their role during pre-swing might be more about controlling the motion rather than generating it. Or maybe the rectus femoris? No, that's a knee extensor. \n\nWait, another angle: during pre-swing, the knee starts to flex to prepare for swing. The primary muscles causing knee flexion are the hamstrings. Even though the gastrocnemius assists, the main action would be from the hamstrings. So the answer should be the hamstrings. But I've heard in some studies that the gastrocnemius may contribute, but perhaps that's secondary. Let me check my notes. Oh right, in the pre-swing phase, as the body moves forward over the stance leg, the plantar flexion (gastrocnemius and soleus) provides the push-off. The rapid knee flexion is initiated by the hamstrings. So the primary muscle group would be the hamstrings. Yeah, I think that's right. The answer is the hamstrings.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: During the pre-swing phase of walking, the knee begins to flex to prepare for the swing phase. This flexion is primarily driven by the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus), which are the main knee flexors. While the gastrocnemius contributes to plantar flexion during push-off and can assist in knee flexion, its role here is secondary. The hamstrings actively contract to initiate rapid knee flexion, making them the primary muscle group responsible for this action in pre-swing.\n\nAnswer: Hamstrings  \nConfidence: 90%",
