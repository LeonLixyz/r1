  "question": "What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which noble gas was the rarest on Earth in 2002 as a percentage of all terrestrial matter. First, I need to recall the noble gases. They are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). Oh, and maybe oganesson, but that's synthetic and not naturally occurring, so probably not relevant here.\n\nNoble gases are generally unreactive, so they don't form compounds easily. Their abundance in the Earth's atmosphere might be a key factor. But the question mentions \"terrestrial matter,\" which could include the entire Earth, not just the atmosphere. Wait, but noble gases are mostly found in the atmosphere because they're inert. However, some like helium can be found underground due to radioactive decay. But overall, their abundance is quite low compared to other elements.\n\nArgon is actually the most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere, making up about 0.93% of the atmosphere. Helium is less abundant in the atmosphere but might be more in the universe. However, considering Earth's crust, helium is produced from alpha decay of radioactive elements. But since the question is about percentage of all terrestrial matter, including the whole Earth, maybe the crust and atmosphere are the main sources here.\n\nRadon is radioactive and has a very short half-life, so even though it's produced from decay chains, it doesn't accumulate. So radon's abundance would be extremely low. Xenon and krypton are heavier noble gases. From what I remember, the order of abundance in the atmosphere is argon > neon > helium > krypton > xenon > radon. So maybe xenon is rarer than krypton? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, looking up in my memory, atmospheric abundances: Argon is about 0.93%, Neon is around 0.0018%, Helium about 0.0005%, Krypton is 0.0001%, Xenon even less, maybe 0.000009%. Radon is negligible because it's radioactive. So if the question is about the rarest, Xenon would be lower than Krypton. But wait, maybe in the entire Earth's composition, considering not just the atmosphere. Helium might be more abundant in the mantle or crust due to radioactive decay. But in terms of percentage of all terrestrial matter, which includes the bulk of the Earth's interior (which is mostly iron, oxygen, silicon, etc.), noble gases as a whole are a tiny fraction. \n\nBut the question is specifically about noble gases as a percentage of all terrestrial matter. So even within noble gases, which is the rarest? Since Radon is part of decay chains and has a short half-life, its presence is minuscule. However, in 2002, maybe Radon's percentage was the lowest. But maybe the answer is Xenon. Alternatively, is there a noble gas even rarer? Wait, I think that among the stable noble gases, Xenon is the rarest. So the answer would be Xenon. But I need to be careful here.\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: Noble gases are rare in Earth's atmosphere and crust, with their abundance decreasing as atomic weight increases. Argon is the most abundant (\u22480.93% of the atmosphere), followed by neon, helium, krypton, and xenon. Radon, being radioactive with a short half-life, exists in trace amounts. However, when considering stable noble gases as a percentage of all terrestrial matter (including the Earth's crust, mantle, and core), xenon is the rarest due to its low atmospheric concentration (\u22480.000009%) and limited presence in geological reservoirs. Radon's instability prevents significant accumulation, but it is not typically counted in long-term abundance assessments. Thus, xenon is the rarest stable noble gas in Earth's overall composition.\n\nAnswer: Xenon  \nConfidence: 85%",
