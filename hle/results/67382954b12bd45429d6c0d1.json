  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel \u039b acting on a qudit. Let me start by recalling what a Pauli channel is. For qubits, a Pauli channel applies one of the Pauli matrices (X, Y, Z) with certain probabilities. But since the question is about qudits, which are d-dimensional systems, the Pauli group for qudits would be generalized. The generalized Pauli matrices for qudits include shift and clock operators. \n\nA Pauli channel can be written as \u039b(\u03c1) = \u03a3 p_i U_i \u03c1 U_i\u2020, where the U_i are the generalized Pauli operators and p_i are probabilities summing to 1. Now, the complementary channel of a quantum channel represents the information sent to the environment. The complementary channel, usually denoted as \u039b^c, is obtained by considering the Stinespring dilation of the channel. \n\nThe structure of the complementary channel for a Pauli channel might involve the environment getting information about which Pauli operator was applied. Since the original channel applies a random Pauli operator and discards the choice, the complementary channel would record which operator was applied in the environment. So, how is the complementary channel constructed here?\n\nIn general, for a channel \u039b(\u03c1) = \u03a3 A_i \u03c1 A_i\u2020, the complementary channel is \u039b^c(\u03c1) = \u03a3 Tr(A_i \u03c1 A_j\u2020) |i><j|. But for the Pauli channel, since each Kraus operator is p_i^{1/2} U_i, the complementary channel would be \u039b^c(\u03c1) = \u03a3 p_i Tr(U_i \u03c1 U_i\u2020) |i><i|, wait, no. Wait, let me check. The complementary channel's Kraus operators are such that if the original channel has Kraus operators {A_k}, then the complementary channel's action is \u039b^c(\u03c1) = sum_{k,l} Tr(A_k \u03c1 A_l\u2020) |k><\u0142|. But in the case where the original channel is a Pauli channel with Kraus operators sqrt(p_i) U_i, then \u039b^c(\u03c1) would be sum_{i,j} Tr(sqrt(p_i) U_i \u03c1 sqrt(p_j) U_j\u2020) |i><j|) ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps not exactly. Wait, the Stinespring dilation would involve an environment that starts in a pure state, then interacts with the system. For the Pauli channel, the Stinespring representation would have the environment prepared in a state that's entangled with the choice of Pauli operator. But the complementary channel would then be the result of tracing out the system, leaving the environment's state depending on the input.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The complementary channel's output is a state that encodes the \"which operator\" information. Since the original channel applies a random Pauli operator and forgets which one, the complementary channel should be sending that classical information to the environment. Wait, no\u2014if the environment is getting a quantum state, not classical information. Hmm.\n\nWait, the complementary channel isn't necessarily classical. Let's think again. For a Pauli channel with Kraus operators K_i = sqrt(p_i) U_i, the complementary channel can be written as \u039b^c(\u03c1) = sum_{i,j} Tr(K_i\u2020 K_j \u03c1) |i><j|. Wait, that formula seems familiar. Let me recall: If the original channel has Kraus operators {K_i}, then the complementary channel is \u039b^c(\u03c1) = sum_{i,j} Tr(K_j\u2020 K_i \u03c1) |i><j|, which comes from the Stinespring dilation where the environment is in a space spanned by |i>. So in this case, with K_i = sqrt(p_i) U_i, then:\n\n\u039b^c(\u03c1) = sum_{i,j} Tr( (sqrt(p_j) U_j)\u2020 (sqrt(p_i) U_i) \u03c1 ) |i><j|\n= sum_{i,j} sqrt(p_i p_j) Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) |i><j|.\n\nBut since the Pauli operators U_i are unitary and orthogonal in the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product (assuming they are elements of the Pauli group for qudits and properly normalized), then Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i) = d \u03b4_{i,j} for the usual Pauli matrices in qubits, but for qudits, the trace orthogonality would depend on the specific structure. Wait, in the qudit case, the generalized Pauli operators form a basis for the space of operators, and they are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. So if U_i and U_j are distinct elements of the Pauli group (generalized), then Tr(U_i\u2020 U_j) = 0, assuming proper normalization. Therefore, Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) would be zero unless i=j?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) is not necessarily zero even if i \u2260 j. The trace Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) would depend on \u03c1. For example, if \u03c1 is the maximally mixed state, then Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) = Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i)/d. And since if i\u2260j, Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i) = 0 (assuming orthogonality), then Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) would be zero. But if \u03c1 is not maximally mixed, this might not be the case. So the complementary channel's output would have off-diagonal terms only if Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) \u2260 0 for some i\u2260j.\n\nBut we are asked about the maximal rank of the complementary channel. The maximal rank would be the maximum possible rank of \u039b^c(\u03c1) over all possible input states \u03c1. So to find the maximal rank, we need to find the maximum possible dimension of the image of \u039b^c(\u03c1) as \u03c1 varies.\n\nBut the complementary channel's output is a matrix whose entries are given by sum_{i,j} sqrt(p_i p_j) Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) |i><j|. Let me think: The matrix \u039b^c(\u03c1) is a square matrix with rows and columns indexed by the Kraus operators (i and j). The rank of \u039b^c(\u03c1) would be the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in this matrix.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the rank is to note that \u039b^c(\u03c1) can be written as a Gram matrix. Each entry (i,j) is sqrt(p_i p_j) Tr(U_j\u2020 U_i \u03c1) = sqrt(p_i p_j) Tr(U_i U_j\u2020 \u03c1). If we define vectors |v_i> = sqrt(p_i) U_i |\u03c8>, where \u03c1 = |\u03c8><\u03c8| (since we can consider pure states without loss of generality for maximum rank), then Tr(U_i U_j\u2020 \u03c1) = <\u03c8| U_i U_j\u2020 |\u03c8> = <\u03c8| U_i U_j\u2020 |\u03c8>. So the entries of \u039b^c(\u03c1) are the inner products <v_i | v_j> where v_i = sqrt(p_i) U_i |\u03c8>. Therefore, \u039b^c(\u03c1) is the Gram matrix of the vectors {v_i}, and the rank of the Gram matrix is equal to the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors.\n\nThe maximum possible rank would thus be the maximum number of linearly independent vectors among the {v_i} as |\u03c8> varies. Since each v_i is sqrt(p_i) U_i |\u03c8>, and the U_i are unitary, the question becomes: what's the maximum number of linearly independent vectors U_i |\u03c8> as |\u03c8> varies over the Hilbert space.\n\nBut wait, for a fixed set of unitaries {U_i}, the maximum number of linearly independent vectors U_i |\u03c8> would depend on the group generated by these unitaries. However, since we're considering the Pauli group, which for qudits is a set of operators that form a basis for the space of operators. Therefore, the set {U_i} is a basis, so they are linearly independent as operators. But when acting on a state |\u03c8>, the set {U_i |\u03c8>} can span the entire space if the {U_i} are sufficiently diverse.\n\nWait, but the number of Pauli operators in the qudit case is d^2. For example, for a qubit, there are 4 Pauli operators. For a qudit of dimension d, the generalized Pauli group has d^2 elements. Therefore, the number of Kraus operators in the Pauli channel is d^2 (assuming all p_i are non-zero). But if some p_i are zero, the number of Kraus operators would be less. However, the question is about the maximal rank over all possible Pauli channels. So, to maximize the rank of the complementary channel, we should consider the case where all p_i are non-zero. Because if some p_i are zero, those terms would not contribute, potentially reducing the rank. Therefore, to get the maximal possible rank, the Pauli channel should have all d^2 Pauli operators with non-zero probabilities.\n\nAssuming all p_i > 0, the complementary channel's output \u039b^c(\u03c1) is a d^2 \u00d7 d^2 matrix (since there are d^2 Kraus operators). The rank of this matrix would be equal to the dimension of the space spanned by the vectors {U_i |\u03c8>} multiplied by sqrt(p_i). But since the U_i are linearly independent operators, for an appropriate choice of |\u03c8>, the vectors {U_i |\u03c8>} could be linearly independent. However, the dimension of the Hilbert space is d. So, each U_i |\u03c8> is a vector in a d-dimensional space. Therefore, even if all U_i |\u03c8> are different, the maximum number of linearly independent vectors among them is d. Therefore, the Gram matrix (which is d^2 \u00d7 d^2) can have rank at most d. Because the vectors {v_i} are in a d-dimensional space, the maximum rank of their Gram matrix is d.\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory. Let me think again. If we have m vectors in an n-dimensional space, the rank of their Gram matrix is at most min(m, n). Since here, the vectors {v_i} are m = d^2 vectors in a d-dimensional space, the Gram matrix would have rank at most d. Therefore, regardless of the input state, the rank of \u039b^c(\u03c1) cannot exceed d. However, the question is about the maximal rank over all possible input states \u03c1. So, the maximum possible rank would be d. But can we actually achieve rank d?\n\nFor example, take |\u03c8> such that the vectors {U_i |\u03c8>} span the entire space. Since the Pauli operators form an irreducible projective representation, for any |\u03c8> that is not a simultaneous eigenvector of all U_i, the orbit {U_i |\u03c8>} should generate the entire space. Wait, but in reality, each Pauli operator may have some common eigenvectors. However, if |\u03c8> is chosen to be a state that is not an eigenstate of any non-identity Pauli operator, then applying different U_i's to |\u03c8> would produce linearly independent states. But how many can we get?\n\nWait, in a d-dimensional space, you can have at most d linearly independent vectors. So even if you have d^2 different vectors, their maximum linear independence is d. Therefore, the Gram matrix can have rank at most d. Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel \u039b^c(\u03c1) is d. Hence, the answer should be d, which for a qudit is the dimension. But wait, the question is about the complementary channel's maximal rank, not its output dimension. The complementary channel outputs a d^2 \u00d7 d^2 matrix, but its rank can't exceed d. So the maximal rank is d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some cases, the rank can be higher. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's consider a simple case. For a qubit (d=2), the Pauli matrices are X, Y, Z, and I. Suppose we have the Pauli channel with all four operators. Then the complementary channel's output is a 4x4 matrix. For a particular input state \u03c1, the rank of this matrix would be the number of linearly independent vectors among {sqrt(p_i) U_i |\u03c8>} where |\u03c8> is a purification of \u03c1. Since each U_i |\u03c8> is a vector in a 2-dimensional space, how many can be linearly independent? Only 2. So the Gram matrix would have rank 2. Therefore, in the qubit case, the maximal rank is 2, which is the dimension d. Similarly, for a qudit of dimension d, the maximal rank would be d. Hence, the answer is d, so the maximal rank is equal to the dimension of the qudit. Therefore, the answer should be d.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The complementary channel of a Pauli channel \u039b maps the input state to an environment system.
