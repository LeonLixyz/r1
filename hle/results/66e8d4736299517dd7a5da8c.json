  "question": "On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, how many non-top-facing stickers must be seen to fully identify the PLL case when solving using the CFOP method?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is about identifying the PLL case in the CFOP method on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube. Specifically, it's asking how many non-top-facing stickers must be seen to fully identify the PLL case.\n\nFirst, I remember that PLL stands for Permutation of the Last Layer. In the CFOP method, after OLL (Orient Last Layer), the last step is PLL where you permute the last layer pieces to their correct positions without disturbing the orientation. So during PLL, the top layer's orientation is already solved, and now we need to arrange the pieces correctly.\n\nNow, to determine the PLL case, you need to look at the arrangement of the top layer edges and corners. But wait, since the cube is 3x3, the top layer is the U face. However, when performing PLL, sometimes you need to look at the stickers on the sides (the F, R, B, L faces) adjacent to the top layer to figure out which case it is. \n\nWait, but the question mentions \"non-top-facing stickers\". So these are stickers that are on the top layer pieces but not on the top face. For example, the edge pieces in the top layer have two stickers: one on the top face and one on the front, back, left, or right face. Similarly, the corner pieces have three stickers, with one on the top and two on the sides.\n\nBut when solving PLL, the top face is already oriented (all the same color), so the color on the top face stickers isn't needed anymore because they're all correct. So to identify the PLL case, you need to look at the side stickers of the top layer pieces. Because the permutation is about how these pieces are arranged around the cube, even though their top color is already correct.\n\nSo for example, in the T permutation, you have a certain pattern of colors on the sides of the top layer edges and corners. The PLL cases are determined by how the edges and corners are permuted, which is visible by looking at their side stickers (the ones not on the top face).\n\nNow, how many such stickers do you need to see? Let's think. For each edge in the top layer, there's one non-top-facing sticker (since edges have two stickers, one top and one side). Similarly, each corner has two non-top-facing stickers (since corners have three stickers, one top and two sides). But when solving PLL, you might not need to look at all of them because some patterns can be identified with fewer stickers.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the number of non-top-facing stickers \"that must be seen to fully identify\" the PLL case. So the minimum number required to uniquely determine which PLL case it is. Because if you don't look at enough, you might confuse it with another case.\n\nIn standard practice, when doing PLL recognition, you usually look at the side stickers of the edges and corners. For example, some people check the two adjacent edge stickers and their corresponding corner stickers. Alternatively, maybe two adjacent edge stickers and one corner sticker. But I need to remember exactly how many are required.\n\nWait, let me recall. There are 21 PLL cases. To distinguish between them, you need enough information from the visible stickers. For instance, some PLLs are edge permutations (like the U perms, H perm, Z perm), others are corner permutations (like the A perms, E perm), and some involve both edges and corners (like the T perm, J perm, etc.).\n\nTo determine the exact case, you need to look at the colors on the sides. For edges: each top edge has a side sticker (F, R, B, L). For corners: each top corner has two side stickers. But maybe you don't need to check all of them. For example, if you're checking adjacent edges, maybe looking at two edges and their corresponding corners?\n\nWait, in some tutorials, they mention that for PLL recognition, you can look at two adjacent edges and their adjacent corners. For example, when solving, a common method is to look at the front and right edges (their side stickers) and the front-right corner's side stickers. That gives enough information to determine the case.\n\nBut how many stickers is that? Each edge has one non-top sticker, each corner has two. So if you check two edges and two corners, that's 2*1 + 2*2 = 2 +4=6 stickers. But maybe that's not the minimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some cases can be recognized with fewer. Wait, but the question is asking for the number needed to \"fully\" identify the case, so it's the minimum required to distinguish all 21 cases. But what's the standard answer here?\n\nI think that for PLL recognition, you only need to look at the four side stickers of the edge pieces (the four edges around the top layer, each has one non-top sticker), but in reality, you don't need all four. Because some PLLs can be identified by looking at two adjacent edges. Wait, but some PLLs require checking the corners.\n\nWait, perhaps you need to look at both edges and corners. For example, some PLLs like the A perm swap two adjacent corners, which would require looking at the corner stickers. Other PLLs like the U perm swap two edges, so you need to look at edge stickers.\n\nSo maybe you need to look at two adjacent edges (their side stickers) and the adjacent corner's side stickers. Let's count. Two edges: 2 stickers. One corner has two stickers. So 2+2=4. But maybe two corners adjacent to those edges? For example, two edges and two corners. Each edge has 1 sticker, each corner has 2. So 2 + (2*2) = 6 stickers. But that seems like a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you only need to look at two adjacent edge stickers and their adjacent corner stickers. For example, if you look at the front edge (non-top sticker on front face) and the right edge (non-top sticker on right face), and then look at the front-right corner's two side stickers (front and right). That would be 2 edges and 1 corner, totaling 2 + 2 = 4 stickers. But is that enough to determine all PLL cases?\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at three edge stickers. Wait, some PLLs like the H perm have all edges swapped, so you need to look at all four edge stickers. But I think H perm can be recognized by the fact that opposite edges are swapped. However, H perm is a specific case that might require looking at all four edges. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number is 4. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in PLL recognition, there's a concept called \"2-side\" recognition, where you look at two adjacent sides (e.g., front and right) and their corresponding stickers. For edges, you check if the front edge matches the front face color and the right edge matches the right face color. If they do, you might have a certain case. If not, you look further. But perhaps this approach requires checking two edges (front and right) and their adjacent corners.\n\nAlternatively, some people use a 3-edge recognition where they check three edges. For example, if three edges are correctly placed, then you know it's a U perm.\n\nBut perhaps the required answer here is that you need to see 4 non-top-facing stickers. Because for the edges, each has one non-top sticker, and the corners each have two. But maybe the answer is two edge stickers and two corner stickers. Wait, but how many stickers would that be?\n\nAlternatively, considering that each PLL case can be determined by looking at the patterns formed by the edge and corner stickers. For example, the T permutation might have a particular pattern where one edge is correct, the adjacent edges are swapped, and the corners are in a certain configuration. So to see that, you need to look at multiple stickers.\n\nBut the question is phrased as how many non-top-facing stickers must be seen. So maybe looking at two edges (2 stickers) and two adjacent corners (each with two stickers, but perhaps only one per corner is needed). Wait, for corners, each has two non-top stickers. If you check two stickers from two corners, that's 2*1=2. So total of 2 (edges) + 2 (corners) = 4.\n\nBut maybe not. For example, if you look at two edges and one corner's two stickers, that's 2+2=4. Alternatively, perhaps two edges and two corners, but one sticker per corner. That's 2 edges (2 stickers) + 2 corners (1 sticker each) = 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 4. Because you need to check two edges (2 stickers) and two corners (each has two, but maybe you look at one per corner, so 2 more), totaling 4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in standard PLL recognition, when using the \"two adjacent edges\" method, you look at two edges and their adjacent corners. For example, front edge (front color), right edge (right color), front-right corner (front and right colors). That's two edges and one corner. The edges give two stickers, the corner gives two stickers. So total of 4 non-top stickers. If that's the case, then the answer is 4.\n\nBut I need to verify. For example, in the T permutation: the front edge doesn't match the front face, the right edge does. The front-right corner has front and right stickers that are swapped. So you need to see the front edge (sticker on front face), right edge (sticker on right face), and the front-right corner's front and right stickers. That's four stickers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe three stickers: two edges and one corner. But corners require two stickers each. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: How many stickers are needed to uniquely determine the permutation. Since the PLL cases involve different permutations of edges and corners, the number of stickers required depends on the maximum information needed to distinguish all cases.\n\nEach edge's position can be determined by its side sticker (non-top), and each corner's position can be determined by its two side stickers. For example, if you can determine the permutation of edges and corners by looking at certain stickers, that's sufficient.\n\nIn some cases, only edges are involved (like U perms, H, Z), others involve corners (A perms, E perm), and others involve both (T, J, etc.)\n\nTherefore, to cover all cases, you need to check enough edge and corner stickers to distinguish between edge permutations, corner permutations, and combinations.\n\nSuppose we take the case where both edges and corners are permuted. For example, the T permutation swaps two adjacent edges and two adjacent corners. To identify this, you need to see the edges and the corners' stickers.\n\nIf you look at two adjacent edges (their non-top stickers) and the adjacent two corners (their two non-top stickers each), that's 2 edges (2 stickers) + 2 corners (2 stickers each) = 2 + 4 = 6 stickers. But maybe that's more than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps you need to check three edge stickers, but I don't think that's right.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a standard answer here. I recall that when learning PLL recognition, the common advice is to look at two adjacent edges and the corresponding corner. For example, looking at the front and right edges (their side stickers) and the front-right corner's two side stickers. That's 2 + 2 = 4 non-top stickers. If that's sufficient to identify all PLL cases, then the answer is 4.\n\nAlternatively, some sources say that you need to see four stickers. For example, two edges and two corners (two stickers each). Wait, no. If you look at two corners, each contributes two stickers, that's four. Plus two edges, that's six. But that can't be right.\n\nMaybe I'm confusing the number of pieces with the number of stickers. Each edge has one non-top sticker, each corner has two. So if you examine two edges and two corners, that's 2*1 + 2*2 = 2+4=6 stickers. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you only need to look at two corners. For example, in the A perm, two corners are swapped. So looking at two corners (two stickers each) would total 4 stickers. But how do you know which edges are swapped?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some cases require looking at edges and others require corners. So the maximum required would be whichever is higher. For example, edge-only cases like U perms require looking at two edges (2 stickers), corner-only cases like A perms require looking at two corners (4 stickers), and combined cases may require looking at both edges and corners (so 6 stickers). But that seems excessive.\n\nBut this line of thinking might be incorrect. Let me think again. In reality, when you're doing PLL recognition, you don't need to check all possible stickers. Instead, you look for patterns. For example, if two adjacent edges are swapped, and their corresponding corners are swapped, that's a T perm. Or if two opposite edges are swapped, that's an H perm. But how many stickers do you need to see to determine that?\n\nFor edge permutations:\n\n- U perm (clockwise or counterclockwise): two adjacent edges are swapped. You can see that by checking three edge stickers. For instance, if three edges are in place, the fourth must be swapped. But maybe checking two edges is enough? For example, if front and right edges are not matching their centers, and back and left do, then it's a U perm.\n\nWait, no. U perm swaps two adjacent edges, so you need to check at least two edges to see if they're swapped. But to determine which U perm it is (clockwise or counter), you might need to check which direction the swap is.\n\nFor corner permutations:\n\n- A perm swaps two adjacent corners. To see this, you need to check at least two corners. Each corner has two stickers. So for two corners, that's four stickers.\n\nIf you have a case that involves both edges and corners, like T perm, you need to check both edges and corners. For T perm, you swap two edges and two corners. So to see that, you need to check two edge stickers (front and right, for example) and two corner stickers (front-right and front-left? Not sure). But how many stickers is that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is four. Because you check two edge stickers and two corner stickers (each corner contributing one sticker, totaling two). But that may not be enough. Or maybe four stickers: two edges and two corners, each corner's two stickers, totaling 2+2*2=6. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a known answer to this. Let me search my memory. I think the standard answer is that you need to look at four non-top-facing stickers. For example, two edges (each has one non-top sticker) and two corners (each has two non-top stickers), but wait that's 2 + 4 = 6. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is 2. For example, when you look at two adjacent edges (their side stickers) and see that they are swapped, that's enough. But no, because there are cases where edges aren't swapped but corners are, like the A perm. So you need to check corners as well.\n\nAnother angle: The PLL case is determined by the permutation of the top layer pieces. Since there are four edges and four corners in the top layer, each with their non-top stickers. To uniquely determine the permutation, you need to look at all permutations. However, in practice, you don't need to look at all 8 pieces (4 edges and 4 corners) because some have dependencies. For example, if three edges are in the correct position, the fourth must be as well, but in reality, permutations can involve cycles.\n\nBut this is getting too deep. Let's think of common PLL recognition techniques. Many speedcubers use 2-look PLL, which groups the cases, but for full PLL, recognition is based on certain patterns. For example:\n\n- For edge permutations like U, H, Z, you need to look at edges' side stickers.\n\n- For corner permutations like A, E, you need to look at corners' side stickers.\n\n- For combined cases like T, J, you need to look at both.\n\nSo, how many stickers are needed in the worst case? For example, the E perm is a diagonal swap of corners. To identify E perm, you need to check two diagonally opposite corners' stickers (each corner has two stickers, but maybe checking one per corner is enough). But if the corners are swapped, their stickers would not match the centers. So for E perm, you need to check two corners (maybe two stickers each, total of 4).\n\nOn the other hand, for H perm, all four edges are swapped in opposite pairs. So you need to check two opposite edges to see if they are swapped (two stickers). But maybe checking two edges is enough.\n\nBut then, how can you cover all cases? The answer might be that in the worst case, you need to check four stickers. For example, checking two edges and two corners. Each edge has one non-top sticker, each corner has two. So if you check two edges (2 stickers) and one corner (2 stickers), that's four. That might be sufficient for most cases. But for E perm, you need to check two corners (4 stickers). Alternatively, maybe two corners' two stickers each (4 stickers) plus two edges (2 stickers) total six. But that seems high.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to recall if there's a standard answer. From what I've read before, when recognizing PLL cases, you typically look at two adjacent edges and their corresponding corner. For example, front edge (front face sticker), right edge (right face sticker), and the front-right corner (front and right face stickers). That's two edges and one corner, totaling 2 + 2 = 4 non-top-facing stickers. This allows you to determine whether the edges are swapped, the corners are swapped, or both. \n\nSo if you can confirm that these four stickers are in the correct place or swapped, you can identify the PLL case. For example, in the T permutation: front edge and right edge are swapped, and the front-right corner and front-left corner are swapped. By checking these four stickers, you can recognize the T perm.\n\nSimilarly, for a U perm, the front and right edges are swapped, but the corners are correct. For an A perm, the corners are swapped but the edges are correct. For a J perm, one edge is correct and the next is swapped, along with a corner swap. \n\nTherefore, checking four non-top-facing stickers (two from edges and two from a corner) would give you enough information to distinguish between the different PLL cases. Hence, the answer is 4.\n\nI think I've heard this before where the number is four. So the answer should be 4 non-top-facing stickers.\n",
