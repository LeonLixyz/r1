  "question": "What is the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is about finding the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field Q(\u221a\u22123). Hmm, I remember that elliptic curves over certain number fields can have torsion subgroups with specific structures. \n\nFirst, I should recall Mazur's theorem, which classifies the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the rationals Q. But wait, this question is not over Q; it's over Q(\u221a\u22123). Mazur's theorem doesn't apply here because that's for the rational field. So I need to think about results for quadratic extensions, specifically those with complex multiplication (CM) maybe?\n\nSince the field here is Q(\u221a\u22123), which is a quadratic imaginary field, and it's known that elliptic curves over such fields might have larger torsion subgroups due to the presence of complex multiplication. Wait, but does the curve itself have CM, or is the field allowing for more torsion points because of roots of unity?\n\nThe field Q(\u221a\u22123) has a ring of integers that includes the Eisenstein integers, since the discriminant is -3. That ring has 6th roots of unity because \u03c9 = (-1 + \u221a-3)/2 is a primitive 3rd root of unity, and squaring it gives a 6th root. So maybe the torsion subgroups can have elements of order 6?\n\nBut the question is about the largest non-cyclic torsion subgroup. So cyclic groups are possible, but non-cyclic would be groups like Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z, Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z, etc. The order would be the size of the group. For example, Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z has order 4, Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z has order 9, but perhaps other combinations.\n\nI remember that over Q, the largest non-cyclic torsion subgroup is Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z, but over larger fields, this can be bigger. For example, over Q(i), there can be torsion subgroups like Z/4Z \u00d7 Z/4Z, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, maybe not that big. Let me think.\n\nIn the paper or references I recall, for elliptic curves over quadratic fields, the possible torsion subgroups have been studied. A result by someone like Najman or others. For example, over Q(\u221a\u22123), the torsion might include groups like Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z. Let me verify.\n\nIf the field has enough roots of unity, then the torsion can have more elements. Since Q(\u221a\u22123) contains the 3rd roots of unity (because \u03c9 is there), then perhaps the elliptic curve can have full 3-torsion? Wait, but the Weil pairing implies that if all the 3-torsion is rational, then the field must contain the 3rd roots of unity. Since Q(\u221a\u22123) does contain them, then maybe E[3] can be defined over Q(\u221a\u22123). \n\nSo if an elliptic curve over Q(\u221a\u22123) has full 3-torsion, then its torsion subgroup would be Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z, which is non-cyclic and has order 9. Is that possible? If so, then 9 would be the answer. But is there a larger non-cyclic group possible here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/4Z, which is order 8. But which is larger between 8 and 9? 9 is larger. So if Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z is possible, then 9 would be the answer. \n\nBut I need to confirm if such a torsion structure is actually possible over Q(\u221a\u22123). For example, over Q, we can't have full 3-torsion because Q doesn't have the necessary roots of unity. But over Q(\u221a\u22123), since the roots are there, maybe it's possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps other combinations. For example, Z/6Z \u00d7 Z/6Z would be order 36, but that's way too big. Probably impossible. The largest known torsion over quadratic fields tends to be smaller. Wait, according to some data, over Q(\u221a\u22123), the possible torsion subgroups include Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z. For example, in a paper or database of elliptic curves over this field, if such a curve exists with that torsion, then the answer is 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/6Z, which has order 12. But is that possible? That's a non-cyclic group. Wait, but does such a group exist as a torsion subgroup over this field?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum non-cyclic torsion subgroup here is Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z. Let me check some references. Since I can't actually look up papers now, I'll try to remember.\n\nAnother approach: the LMFDB (L-functions and Modular Forms Database) has data on elliptic curves over various fields. If I recall, over Q(\u221a\u22123), there are elliptic curves with 3-torsion structures. For example, the curve y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 1 has CM by the Eisenstein integers (since discriminant -3) and over Q(\u221a\u22123), maybe its torsion includes more points. Wait, over Q, this curve has trivial torsion? Or maybe order 6? Let me think.\n\nWait, over Q, the curve y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 1 has torsion subgroup of order 6. Because when x=0, y=1 and y=-1, so points (0,1) and (0,-1) of order 3. Also, the point at infinity. But maybe over Q(\u221a\u22123), there are more torsion points. For instance, maybe all 3-torsion points become rational, leading to Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z.\n\nAlternatively, take the curve y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + B with B in Q(\u221a\u22123). The 3-torsion points are solutions to x\u00b3 + B = 0, so x = (-B)^{1/3}. If the field contains the cube roots of B and the cube roots of 1, then all 3-torsion points would be rational. Since Q(\u221a\u22123) contains the cube roots of 1 (because \u03c9 is there), then if B is a cube in the field, x can be expressed, leading to all 3-torsion points. \n\nIf B is a cube, say B = a\u00b3 for some a in Q(\u221a\u22123), then x\u00b3 + B = x\u00b3 + a\u00b3 = (x + a)(x\u00b2 - a x + a\u00b2). The roots would be x = -a, and roots of x\u00b2 - a x + a\u00b2. So over Q(\u221a\u22123), since we have the cube roots of unity, we can split x\u00b2 - a x + a\u00b2 into linear factors if the discriminant is a square. The discriminant is a\u00b2 - 4 a\u00b2 = -3 a\u00b2. Since the field has \u221a-3, this discriminant is a square. Therefore, x\u00b2 - a x + a\u00b2 factors, so all three roots are in the field. Therefore, the curve would have three x-coordinates where y=0, leading to points of order 3. Hence, the 3-torsion subgroup would be Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z.\n\nTherefore, such a curve exists, so the largest non-cyclic torsion subgroup would have order 9. Therefore, the answer is 9, corresponding to Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z.\n\nBut wait, could there be a larger non-cyclic group? For example, Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/6Z, which is order 18. But that's cyclic? Wait, Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/6Z is actually isomorphic to Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/3Z, but since 3 and 6 are not coprime, it might not split that way. Wait, no, Z/6Z is Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/3Z, so Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/6Z would be Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/3Z, but that would be non-cyclic. Wait, but does such a group exist as a torsion subgroup?\n\nBut elliptic curve torsion subgroups are finite abelian groups, hence they are products of cyclic groups. So the non-cyclic ones would be products of two or more cyclic groups. The largest such order would be achieved by the product of two cyclic groups of the largest possible orders. \n\nBut for a torsion subgroup over a number field, the possible structures are limited by the field's properties. Since Q(\u221a\u22123) has 6th roots of unity (since \u03c9 is there and i is not, but \u221a-3 is there, so combining \u03c9 and \u221a-3 gives all 6th roots?), perhaps allowing for higher order.\n\nWait, but 6th roots of unity: e^(2\u03c0i/6) = e^(\u03c0i/3) = (1 + \u221a3 i)/2. Is that in Q(\u221a\u22123)? Let me see. The field Q(\u221a\u22123) is the same as Q(\u03c9), where \u03c9 = (-1 + \u221a-3)/2. So e^(\u03c0i/3) is \u03c9, which is in the field. So the 6th roots of unity are present in Q(\u221a\u22123). Therefore, the multiplicative group has elements of order 6. \n\nTherefore, perhaps an elliptic curve over Q(\u221a\u22123) could have a point of order 6. But if the torsion subgroup is non-cyclic, it would need to have two different cyclic factors. For example, Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/6Z has order 12. Alternatively, Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/6Z has order 18, but that might be cyclic. Wait, no: if the exponents are not coprime, the product is not cyclic. Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/6Z is not cyclic because 3 and 6 share a common factor. But the group Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/6Z is actually isomorphic to Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/3Z, which is non-cyclic with order 18. But does such a group occur as a torsion subgroup?\n\nBut I don't recall elliptic curves having such large torsion subgroups. The maximum known over quadratic fields is usually up to order 16 or so. For example, over Q(\u221a\u22121), there might be curves with Z/4Z \u00d7 Z/4Z, which is order 16. Wait, but over Q(\u221a\u22123), perhaps the maximum non-cyclic is Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z (order 9), and other structures might not reach higher non-cyclic orders.\n\nAlternatively, Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/4Z has order 8, which is less than 9. Similarly, Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/6Z is order 12. Wait, if that's possible, then 12 would be larger than 9. Hmm. Now I need to check whether a non-cyclic group of order 12 can exist here.\n\nSuppose there's an elliptic curve over Q(\u221a\u22123) with torsion subgroup Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/6Z. That group is non-cyclic. How could that happen? The curve would need to have full 2-torsion and a point of order 6. Alternatively, full 2-torsion and full 3-torsion, but that would lead to a larger group. Wait, but full 2-torsion (Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z) plus a point of order 3 would generate a group of order 12, but the structure depends on how they interact.\n\nWait, suppose E has full 2-torsion (so four points of order 2), and a point of order 3. Then the torsion subgroup would be generated by these. But the structure isn't necessarily Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/6Z. Alternatively, it might be Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/3Z, but that's not possible because an elliptic curve's torsion subgroup is either cyclic or a product of two cyclic groups. Wait, the structure theorem for finite abelian groups says it's a product of cyclic groups, but for elliptic curves over number fields, the torsion subgroup is always a product of at most two cyclic groups. So if there's a point of order 6 and another point of order 2 not in the cyclic subgroup generated by the order 6 point, then the group would be Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/6Z. But does such a curve exist over Q(\u221a\u22123)?\n\nAlternatively, if the curve has a point of order 6 and full 2-torsion, but the points of order 2 are in the cyclic subgroup. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The torsion subgroup is abelian, so it's a product of two cyclic groups. If the group is Z/mZ \u00d7 Z/nZ where m divides n. So to have Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/6Z, the group would be m=2 and n=6. So yes, that's possible. But does such a curve exist over Q(\u221a\u22123)?\n\nFor example, take the curve y\u00b2 = x(x - a)(x - b), which has full 2-torsion. If this curve also has a point of order 6, then its torsion subgroup would be Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/6Z. Alternatively, maybe a curve with j-invariant 0, which is the CM curve with discriminant -3. For example, y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 1. Wait, over Q, this curve has torsion subgroup of order 6. But over Q(\u221a\u22123), maybe it picks up more torsion points.\n\nWait, let me check y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 1 over Q(\u221a\u22123). The points of order 3 would satisfy 3P = O. The x-coordinates of 3-torsion points are roots of the division polynomial. For the curve y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 1, the 3-division polynomial is something like 3x^4 + 6 a x + ... Wait, maybe it's easier to note that over a field where all 3rd roots of unity exist, the 3-torsion points should be rational if the equation splits. For example, solving for y=0 gives x\u00b3 = -1. So x = -1, \u03c9, \u03c9\u00b2. But \u03c9 is in Q(\u221a\u22123), so these x-coordinates are in the field. Therefore, the points (\u03c9, 0), (\u03c9\u00b2, 0), and (-1, 0) are all in E[2], but wait, no\u2014points of order 2 have y=0, but order 3 points must satisfy 3P = O. Wait, maybe I'm confusing.\n\nWait, no. Points of order 3 are not the same as points where y=0. Points of order 2 are those with y=0. The 3-torsion points are different. For the curve y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 1, the 3-torsion points can be computed using the division polynomials, but it's a bit involved. Alternatively, since this curve has complex multiplication by the ring of integers of Q(\u221a\u22123), which is the Eisenstein integers, then over Q(\u221a\u22123), all the torsion points might be rational. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the curve y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 1 over Q(\u221a\u22123) has j-invariant 0. The torsion for such curves can be large. For instance, in some references, it's mentioned that over Q(\u221a\u22123), the elliptic curve with j-invariant 0 can have Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z torsion. For example, the curve y\u00b2 = x\u00b3 + 1 might have all its 3-torsion points rational over Q(\u221a\u22123), leading to the group Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z.\n\nIf that's the case, then the order is 9, which is non-cyclic. If there's no larger non-cyclic group, then 9 is the answer. \n\nAnother angle: according to a theorem by Merel and others, but more recent results by people like Harris, for quadratic fields, the possible torsion structures have been classified. From what I recall, over Q(\u221a\u22123), the maximal possible non-cyclic torsion subgroup is indeed Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z of order 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Z/4Z \u00d7 Z/4Z, but over Q(i), such groups might exist. For Q(\u221a\u22123), since the 4th roots of unity are not present (since i is not in Q(\u221a\u22123)), unless \u221a-3 can give them. Wait, Q(\u221a\u22123) contains \u03c9, which is a primitive 3rd root, but not a primitive 4th root. So the field doesn't contain i, unless \u221a-3 can generate it. But \u221a-3 squared is -3, and i is sqrt(-1). So unless \u221a-1 is in Q(\u221a\u22123), which it isn't. Because Q(\u221a\u22123) has degree 2 over Q, and adding i would make it degree 4. Therefore, the 4th roots of unity aren't in Q(\u221a\u22123). Therefore, torsion subgroups with elements of order 4 might not be fully rational. Hence, Z/4Z \u00d7 Z/4Z is probably not possible here.\n\nTherefore, the largest non-cyclic torsion subgroup would be Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z with order 9.\n",
