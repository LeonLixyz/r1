  "question": "Let $C$ denote the category of indecomposable finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ representations for $q$ a primitive third root of unity. What percentage of the objects of $C$ are irreducible?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what percentage of the objects in category C are irreducible. The category C is described as the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of u_q(sl_2 C) where q is a primitive third root of unity. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basics about quantum groups. The algebra u_q(sl_2) is a restricted version of the quantum group U_q(sl_2) when q is a root of unity. For q being a primitive third root, that's when q^3 = 1. So, the parameter here is at a root of unity, which typically changes the representation theory significantly compared to the generic case where q is not a root of unity.\n\nIn the case of U_q(sl_2) when q is a root of unity, the representation theory becomes more complicated. The finite-dimensional representations are no longer semisimple, which means there are indecomposable modules that are not irreducible. The category of finite-dimensional representations would have both reducible and irreducible indecomposable modules.\n\nBut wait, the question specifically says category C is the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations. So all objects in C are indecomposable by definition. The question is asking what percentage of them are irreducible. So, among all indecomposable modules, how many are irreducible?\n\nAn irreducible module is, by definition, indecomposable (since it can't be decomposed further). But the converse isn't true; indecomposable modules might not be irreducible. So if we have a category of indecomposable modules, the irreducible ones are a subset of them. The percentage would be the number of irreducibles divided by the total number of indecomposables.\n\nNow, for u_q(sl_2) at a root of unity, in this case, third root. Let me recall the structure of the representations. When q is a primitive l-th root of unity, the representation theory of u_q(sl_2) resembles that of the Lie algebra sl_2 in positive characteristic, where the category of modules has a lot of indecomposables, particularly of certain dimensions.\n\nIn the case where l=3, which is our case here (since q is a primitive third root, so l=3), the restricted quantum group u_q(sl_2) has a finite representation type. Wait, no. Wait, in general, for roots of unity, the representation type can be wild or tame. For sl_2, I think when l is the order of q, for certain l, the representation type is tame, otherwise wild. For example, when l=2, maybe it's tame. Wait, perhaps for l=3, the representation type is tame. Let me check my memory.\n\nWait, actually, for u_q(sl_2) when q is a primitive l-th root of unity, the representation type is wild for l >= 3. Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe when l is a prime? Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps for u_q(sl_2), when l is odd, the representation type is wild. Wait, but maybe for l=3, it's still tame. Wait, I need to recall specific classification results.\n\nAlternatively, think about the dimensions of the indecomposable modules. For sl_2 in characteristic p, the indecomposable modules can have dimensions up to p. For the quantum case at root of unity, similar behavior might happen. For q a primitive l-th root of unity, the usual Verma modules have certain structures, and the simple modules are classified by their highest weights. However, when the quantum parameter is a root of unity, the simple modules are similar to the classical case but up to a certain dimension.\n\nWait, if q^3 = 1, then the order is 3. So, the restricted quantum group u_q(sl_2) has a Hopf algebra structure. The finite-dimensional representations here, particularly indecomposable ones, would have certain properties. Let me recall that in such cases, the simple modules are parameterized by weights in a certain range. For u_q(sl_2), the simple modules are typically of dimensions 1, 2, ..., up to (l-1)/2 if l is odd. Wait, but l=3 here, so (l-1)/2=1. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps there's a different structure.\n\nWait, u_q(sl_2) when q is a primitive l-th root of unity has simple modules of dimensions 1, 2, ..., l. Wait, perhaps that's not exactly accurate. Wait, actually, for the quantum group at a root of unity, the simple modules can have dimensions up to l. For example, in the case of u_q(sl_2) with q^l=1, there are l-dimensional modules. Wait, but in our case, l=3. So maybe the simple modules are of dimensions 1, 2, 3? Hmm, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simple modules are only of certain dimensions. For example, in the case where the quantum parameter is at a root of unity, the representation theory can have both typical and atypical modules. However, when l=3, since 3 is small, maybe all the simple modules are of a particular dimension.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of simple modules is equal to l. For u_q(sl_2) with q a primitive l-th root of unity, the number of simple modules is l. For example, when l=3, there would be 3 simple modules. Each simple module is irreducible, hence also indecomposable. But there are other indecomposable modules that are not simple. So in the category C, which consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional modules, the irreducible ones are exactly the simple modules. So if there are 3 simple modules, and the total number of indecomposable modules is more than 3, then the percentage would be 3 divided by the total number of indecomposable modules times 100.\n\nBut how many indecomposable modules are there for u_q(sl_2) when q is a primitive third root of unity?\n\nThis is the key point. If the algebra is of finite representation type, then there are finitely many indecomposable modules. If it's of tame or wild type, then there are infinitely many. So the question is: for u_q(sl_2) with q^3=1, is the representation type finite, tame, or wild?\n\nFrom what I recall, for the restricted quantum group u_q(sl_2) when q is a primitive l-th root of unity, the representation type is:\n\n- Finite if l=2,\n\n- Tame if l=3,\n\n- Wild for l >=4.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm. Some references say that for u_q(sl_2), when l is prime, the representation type is tame for l=2 and l=3, and wild otherwise. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps for l=3, the representation type is tame, which means there are infinitely many indecomposable modules, but they can be classified in a certain way, such as by parameters. Whereas for l >=4, it's wild, meaning the classification is intractable.\n\nBut if it's tame, then there are infinitely many indecomposable modules, and hence the percentage of irreducibles would be zero, since there are infinitely many indecomposables but only finitely many irreducibles. But in our case, l=3, so perhaps the category is tame, hence infinitely many indecomposables, meaning that the percentage would be zero. But wait, is that the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing with the classical Lie algebra case. Let me think again.\n\nIn the case of the Lie algebra sl_2 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0, the representation type is wild for p >=3, but in characteristic 2, it's tame. However, for quantum groups at roots of unity, the behavior is different. For the quantum group u_q(sl_2) with q a primitive l-th root of unity, the representation type is:\n\n- Finite for l=2,\n\n- Tame for l=3,\n\n- Wild for l >=4.\n\nThis seems familiar. So in the case l=3, the algebra has tame representation type. Tame means that the indecomposable modules can be classified by a finite number of 1-parameter families. So there are infinitely many indecomposable modules. But how many irreducibles are there? In this case, the simple modules (irreducibles) are finite in number. For example, in the case of sl_2 in characteristic p, there are p simple modules (dimensions 1,2,...,p), but for the quantum group at root of unity, it's similar.\n\nWait, actually, for u_q(sl_2) with q^l=1, the simple modules are parameterized by the highest weights, which in this case would be 0, 1, ..., l-1. Each highest weight corresponds to a simple module of dimension equal to the highest weight +1? Wait, not exactly. Let me recall that in the quantum case, the simple modules for u_q(sl_2) when q is a primitive l-th root of unity have dimensions up to l. Specifically, for each integer n with 0 <= n <= l-1, there's a simple module of dimension n+1. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the dimensions might be bounded by l.\n\nWait, actually, in the classical case, when you have a root of unity, the simple modules can have dimensions up to l. For example, when l=3, the simple modules would be of dimensions 1, 2, 3. Let me check: if l=3, then the possible highest weights are 0, 1, 2. Wait, maybe in this case, each highest weight module has dimension equal to the highest weight plus 1, so weights 0,1,2 would correspond to dimensions 1,2,3. Therefore, there are three simple modules.\n\nSo if the indecomposable modules are in a tame category, which for l=3 would mean that there are infinitely many indecomposable modules, then the simple modules (irreducible) are finite: 3 in this case. Therefore, the percentage of irreducibles in the category C would be 3 divided by infinity, which is zero. But percentage-wise, since there are infinitely many indecomposable modules, the percentage would approach zero. Therefore, the answer should be 0%.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the category C is only considering finite-dimensional indecomposable modules. The problem statement says \"indecomposable finite-dimensional\", so all objects in C are indecomposable and finite-dimensional. If the category has infinitely many objects (i.e., infinitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules), then the number of irreducibles is finite (3), hence their percentage is zero. But if the category has only finitely many indecomposable modules, then the percentage is non-zero.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that for l=3, the representation type is tame, which would mean there are infinitely many indecomposable modules. So then, the percentage is zero.\n\nWait, but maybe in this case, even though it's tame, for u_q(sl_2) at l=3, there are only finitely many indecomposable modules. But that contradicts the idea that tame implies infinite but classifiable. Wait, no. Tame representation type means that the indecomposable modules can be classified into a countable number of 1-parameter families, so there are infinitely many indecomposable modules. So if that's the case, then the number of irreducibles is finite (3), hence their percentage is zero.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. For example, in the classical case of finite-dimensional algebras, a tame algebra has for each dimension vector, a finite number of 1-parameter families of indecomposables. So there are infinitely many indecomposable modules. In that case, the simple modules (irreducibles) are finite, so the ratio is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this specific case, the number of indecomposable modules is finite. Wait, let's think again. For the restricted quantum group u_q(sl_2) with q^3=1, maybe there are only finitely many indecomposable modules. How can I confirm?\n\nWait, another approach. When l=3, the small quantum group u_q(sl_2) is a finite-dimensional algebra. The dimension of u_q(sl_2) is l^3 = 27? Wait, maybe. The quantum group U_q(sl_2) has generators E, F, K, K^{-1}, and when we take the restricted form at l=3, then E^l, F^l, and K^l are in the center. But the small quantum group u_q(sl_2) is the quotient by the relations E^l=0, F^l=0, K^l=1. So the dimension of u_q(sl_2) is l * l * 2? Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, actually, for u_q(sl_2), the dimension is l^3. For example, when l=3, the dimension is 3^3=27. Because the algebra is generated by E, F, K with relations:\n\nK^l = 1,\n\nE^l = 0,\n\nF^l = 0.\n\nAnd the relations KEK^{-1} = q^2 E, KFK^{-1} = q^{-2} F,\n\nEF - FE = (K - K^{-1})/(q - q^{-1}).\n\nSo the basis would be E^i F^j K^k, with 0 <= i,j < l and 0 <= k < l? Wait, no. Because of the relations between E and F, the PBW basis is different. For u_q(sl_2), the standard basis is { E^i F^j K^m | 0 <= i,j < l, 0 <= m < l }, but due to the commutation relations, some terms may combine. Wait, but I think the dimension is indeed l^3. So when l=3, the dimension is 27.\n\nA finite-dimensional algebra of dimension 27. The representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras can be of finite, tame, or wild type. For example, if the algebra is of finite type, then there are only finitely many indecomposable modules. If it's tame, there are infinitely many but classifiable. If it's wild, then it's considered unclassifiable.\n\nBut for u_q(sl_2) at l=3, some references indicate that it's of tame representation type. For instance, in the paper \"Representation type of small quantum groups\" by C. M. Ringel, or other works. However, I might not remember exactly.\n\nBut assuming that for l=3, the algebra is tame, then there are infinitely many indecomposable modules. Hence, the number of irreducibles (which are the simple modules) is finite (3 in this case), so their percentage is 0%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are only finitely many indecomposable modules. Wait, if the algebra is of finite representation type, then all indecomposable modules are of finite number, and each is a direct summand of the algebra's regular module. But for l=3, I don't recall if it's of finite type.\n\nAnother angle: for the algebra u_q(sl_2) at l=3, the number of simple modules is l=3. Then, according to some results, if the global dimension is finite, or other properties.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that u_q(sl_2) at l=3 has 3 simple modules. Then, according to the theory, if it's tame, then the number of indecomposable modules is infinite. Hence, the percentage would be 0%.\n\nBut perhaps I should think about specific examples. For example, in the case of the Kronecker quiver (two vertices, two arrows), which is tame, there are infinitely many indecomposable modules, but only finitely many simples. So the percentage of simples among indecomposables is zero.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, if the algebra is tame, then the same logic applies. Therefore, the percentage is 0%.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there other irreducible modules in the category besides the simple ones? No, in the context of finite-dimensional modules, irreducible and simple are the same. Because a simple module is one with no nontrivial submodules, and since we're in finite-dimensional context, simple modules are irreducible and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, if there are 3 simple modules and infinitely many indecomposable modules, then the percentage is 0%.\n\nThus, the answer should be 0% with high confidence. However, I need to check if there's a possibility that all indecomposable modules are irreducible, but that can't be, because in non-semisimple categories, there are indecomposables that are not irreducible. Since u_q(sl_2) at root of unity is not semisimple (as q is a root of unity), there must exist indecomposable modules that are reducible (i.e., have proper submodules), hence not irreducible. Therefore, the irreducibles are a strict subset of the indecomposables. So if the total number of indecomposables is infinite, the percentage is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0%.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The category $C$ consists of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. At this root of unity, $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is a finite-dimensional non-semisimple algebra with tame representation type.

Wait, if the algebra is of finite representation type, then all indecomposable modules are of finite number, and each is a direct summand of the algebra's regular module. But for l=3, I don't recall if it's of finite type.\n\nAnother angle: for the algebra u_q(sl_2) at l=3, the number of simple modules is l=3. Then, according to some results, if the global dimension is finite, or other properties.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that u_q(sl_2) at l=3 has 3 simple modules. Then, according to the theory, if it's tame, then the number of indecomposable modules is infinite. Hence, the percentage would be 0%.\n\nBut perhaps I should think about specific examples. For example, in the case of the Kronecker quiver (two vertices, two arrows), which is tame, there are infinitely many indecomposable modules, but only finitely many simples. So the percentage of simples among indecomposables is zero.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, if the algebra is tame, then the same logic applies. Therefore, the percentage is 0%.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there other irreducible modules in the category besides the simple ones? No, in the context of finite-dimensional modules, irreducible and simple are the same. Because a simple module is one with no nontrivial submodules, and since we're in finite-dimensional context, simple modules are irreducible and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, if there are 3 simple modules and infinitely many indecomposable modules, then the percentage is 0%.\n\nThus, the answer should be 0% with high confidence. However, I need to check if there's a possibility that all indecomposable modules are irreducible, but that can't be, because in non-semisimple categories, there are indecomposables that are not irreducible. Since u_q(sl_2) at root of unity is not semisimple (as q is a root of unity), there must exist indecomposable modules that are reducible (i.e., have proper submodules), hence not irreducible. Therefore, the irreducibles are a strict subset of the indecomposables. So if the total number of indecomposables is infinite, the percentage is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0%.",
