  "question": "Where was Geoffrey Chaucer when Blanche of Lancaster died?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. Italy\nB. France\nC. England\nD. Unknown \nE. Scotland",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died. I need to figure out this answer based on what I remember about Chaucer's life and Blanche's death dates.\n\nFirst, when did Blanche of Lancaster die? I recall that she was the first wife of John of Gaunt, and she died in 1368 or 1369. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think Blanche died in 1368. Now, Geoffrey Chaucer was a contemporary of John of Gaunt, and he actually wrote a poem called \"The Book of the Duchess\" which is believed to be an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster. That poem was written in the late 1360s, right?\n\nSo, if Blanche died in 1368, where was Chaucer at that time? I remember that Chaucer had various diplomatic missions. Let me think about his timeline. In the late 1360s, there might be some records of his travels. Wait, Chaucer was in Italy around 1372-1373, I think. But before that, in 1368, was he in England? Because he was part of the English court. He married Philippa Roet around 1366, so by 1368, he was probably in England. Also, \"The Book of the Duchess\" was written soon after Blanche's death, which suggests he was in England at the time, as the poem was for the English court and John of Gaunt. \n\nBut wait, was there any record of him being abroad during that time? I'm not sure. Let me check my memory. From what I remember, Chaucer's travels to Italy came later, like in the 1370s. So in 1368, he was likely in England. Therefore, the answer would be C. England. Alternatively, if there's any uncertainty, maybe the answer is D. Unknown, but I don't think so. The connection to the poem and his presence in the court suggests he was in England when Blanche died. So I think the correct answer is C. England. Confidence isn't 100% because I might be mixing up exact dates, but my recollection points to England.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: Blanche of Lancaster died in 1368, and Geoffrey Chaucer's poem \"The Book of the Duchess\" is widely regarded as an elegy for her, commissioned by her husband, John of Gaunt. Historical records suggest Chaucer was part of the English court during this period and did not travel to Italy until the 1370s. His presence in England aligns with the poem's creation and dedication, making it most likely he was in England at the time of Blanche's death. While exact documentation is sparse, the contextual evidence strongly supports this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: C. England  \nConfidence: 85%",
