  "question": " How many finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2?\n",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many finite groups have maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. Hmm, product-free sets. I remember that a product-free set in a group is a subset where no two elements multiply to give another element in the set. So, a set S is product-free if for any a, b in S, the product ab is not in S.\n\nNow, the question is about maximal by inclusion such sets of size 2. Maximal by inclusion means that you can't add any other element from the group to the set without violating the product-free condition. So, there's a set with two elements, and adding any third element would create a situation where two elements multiply to give another in the set.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of finite groups that contain such sets. So, how many different finite groups have at least one maximal product-free set of size 2?\n\nFirst, I need to think about small finite groups. Let's start with the smallest groups: the trivial group, which has only the identity element. But a product-free set in the trivial group would be empty since the only element multiplied by itself is itself. But the question is about sets of size 2, so the trivial group is out.\n\nNext, cyclic groups. Let's look at cyclic groups of small order. Let's start with order 2: Z_2. The elements are 0 and 1. A product-free set of size 2 would need two elements, but the group itself has only two elements. But in Z_2 under addition, the operation is addition modulo 2. Wait, product-free here would be additive, but the term \"product-free\" is usually in multiplicative groups. Wait, but maybe in additive groups, the term translates to sum-free sets. So perhaps in additive groups, a sum-free set is a set where no two elements add up to another element in the set. So in Z_2, a sum-free set would have to be such that if you take two elements (but there are only two elements, 0 and 1), their sum (mod 2) can't be in the set. Let's check. Suppose the set is {0,1}. Then 0+1=1, which is in the set. So that's not sum-free. The only other possible set of size 2 is the entire group, which isn't sum-free. So Z_2 can't have a product-free (sum-free) set of size 2. So Z_2 is out.\n\nNext, Z_3. Elements are 0,1,2. A sum-free set here. Let me recall that in additive cyclic groups, a sum-free set is a set where no two elements add up to another. For Z_3, the maximum size of a sum-free set is 1, because if you take two elements, say {1,2}, then 1+1=2, which is in the set. Alternatively, {1} is sum-free. But size 2 would require two elements. Let's see. For example, {1,2}: 1+1=2, which is in the set. So that's not sum-free. {0,1}: 0+1=1, which is in the set. Not sum-free. Any two elements in Z_3 would have this problem. So sum-free sets in Z_3 can't have size 2. So Z_3 doesn't work.\n\nZ_4. Elements 0,1,2,3. Let's look for sum-free sets. The largest sum-free set in Z_4 is size 1. Because, for example, {1,3} would have 1+3=0, which isn't in the set. Wait, but 1+1=2, which isn't in {1,3}. Wait, maybe {1,3} is sum-free. Let's check. 1+1=2 (not in the set). 1+3=0 (not in the set). 3+3=2 (not in the set). So actually, {1,3} is sum-free. So size 2. Now, is this maximal by inclusion? Can we add another element without violating the sum-free condition? Let's see. The remaining elements are 0 and 2. Adding 0: check if adding 0 would create any sums. The set becomes {0,1,3}. Now, 0+1=1 (in the set). So that's bad. So adding 0 would make it not sum-free. Adding 2: check {1,3,2}. Now, 2+2=0 (not in the set). 2+1=3 (which is in the set). So 1+2=3, which is in the set. So adding 2 would create a sum (1+2=3) in the set. So neither 0 nor 2 can be added. Therefore, {1,3} is a maximal sum-free set of size 2 in Z_4. So Z_4 is a candidate.\n\nSo Z_4 has such a set. Therefore, at least one group (Z_4) works.\n\nNext, Z_5. Let's check sum-free sets. The maximum size of a sum-free set in Z_5 should be 2. For example, {2,3}? Let's check. 2+2=4, which is not in the set. 2+3=0, which is not in the set. 3+3=1, which is not in the set. So {2,3} is sum-free. Now, can we add another element? Let's try adding 4. The set becomes {2,3,4}. Check sums: 2+4=1 (not in set), 3+4=2 (which is in the set). So 3+4=2 would be a problem. Therefore, adding 4 would make the set not sum-free. Similarly, adding 1: check sums with existing elements. 1+2=3 (in the set). So adding 1 would create a problem. Similarly, adding 0: 0+2=2 (in the set). So adding 0 is bad. Therefore, {2,3} is maximal. So Z_5 also has a maximal sum-free set of size 2.\n\nWait, but the question is about product-free sets. Wait, but in additive groups, product-free would be sum-free? Hmm. Wait, the problem statement uses \"product-free\", which in multiplicative groups would mean no two elements multiply to another. But in additive groups, the analogous concept would be sum-free (no two elements add to another). But the term \"product-free\" here might be in multiplicative groups. Wait, but the question is about finite groups in general, not necessarily abelian. So perhaps in multiplicative non-abelian groups, but the concept is the same: a product-free set S where for any a, b in S, the product ab is not in S.\n\nSo, for example, in the multiplicative group of integers modulo n (when possible). But for cyclic groups like Z_4 under addition, perhaps the question is considering them as additive groups, but product-free in additive groups would actually be sum-free. Hmm, this is a possible confusion point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses \"product-free\" in the general group sense, so in additive groups, product would be the group operation (addition). So, in additive groups, product-free would mean that for any a, b in the set, a + b is not in the set. So, in additive groups, product-free is equivalent to sum-free.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about multiplicative groups, but for finite groups in general, both additive and multiplicative. Wait, no, all groups are considered with their respective operations. So, the question is about finite groups, regardless of their operation. So in additive groups (like cyclic groups under addition), a product-free set would be a set where the sum of any two elements is not in the set.\n\nSo, the problem is general. Now, the question is: how many finite groups contain such a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nSo, I need to check for each finite group whether it has such a set.\n\nLet's consider first the cyclic groups of small order.\n\nWe saw that Z_4 (cyclic group of order 4) has such a set {1,3} (in additive notation, but equivalent to {a, a^3} in multiplicative terms if the group is written multiplicatively). Similarly, Z_5 has a set {2,3} (additive), which is sum-free and maximal by inclusion.\n\nWait, but in Z_5, the maximal sum-free set {2,3} is size 2. But is it maximal? Adding 4: 2+4=1, 3+4=2. So adding 4 would create a problem when 3+4=2 is in the original set? Wait, in the set {2,3,4}, 3+4=2, which is in the set. So that's not allowed. Therefore, adding 4 is invalid. Similarly, adding 1: 2+1=3 (in the set). Adding 0: 0+2=2 (in the set). So yes, the set {2,3} is maximal.\n\nBut the question is about maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. So in Z_4 and Z_5, such sets exist. But wait, but then maybe also in larger cyclic groups?\n\nWait, but in Z_6, let's check. Let's look for a product-free (sum-free) set of size 2. For example, {1,3}. Check sums: 1+1=2, not in the set. 1+3=4, not in the set. 3+3=0, not in the set. So {1,3} is sum-free. Now, is it maximal? Adding 2: {1,2,3}. Then 1+2=3, which is in the set. So cannot add 2. Adding 4: 1+4=5, not in the set. 3+4=1, which is in the set. So adding 4 would lead to 3+4=1 in the set. So can't add 4. Adding 5: {1,3,5}. Now, 1+5=0, not present. 3+5=2, not present. 5+5=4, not present. So maybe {1,3,5} is sum-free. Wait, does that work?\n\nWait, in {1,3,5}:\n\n1+1=2 (not in set)\n\n1+3=4 (not in set)\n\n1+5=6=0 (mod 6) (not in set)\n\n3+3=6=0 (not in set)\n\n3+5=8=2 (not in set)\n\n5+5=10=4 (not in set)\n\nSo {1,3,5} is sum-free. So adding 5 to {1,3} gives a larger sum-free set. Therefore, the original set {1,3} is not maximal by inclusion. So in Z_6, the maximal sum-free sets must be larger. Therefore, Z_6 may have larger maximal sum-free sets, so the set of size 2 is not maximal. Therefore, Z_6 does not count.\n\nSo, perhaps only certain cyclic groups have such sets. Let's check Z_4 and Z_5.\n\nWait, but earlier in Z_5, the set {2,3} is maximal. Let's check if you can add any element to it. The other elements are 0,1,4. Adding 0: {0,2,3}. Then 0+2=2, which is in the set. So invalid. Adding 1: {1,2,3}. Then 1+2=3, which is in the set. Invalid. Adding 4: {2,3,4}. Then 3+4=2, which is in the set. So can't add anything. So yes, {2,3} is maximal. So Z_5 is okay.\n\nBut in Z_6, as we saw, the set {1,3} can be extended to {1,3,5}, which is sum-free. So {1,3} is not maximal. Therefore, Z_6 doesn't have a maximal sum-free set of size 2.\n\nSo far, Z_4 and Z_5 are candidates. Are there others?\n\nLet me check Z_7. Let's see if there's a sum-free set of size 2 that's maximal. Let's pick {1,3}. Check sums: 1+1=2, 1+3=4, 3+3=6. None are in the set. So {1,3} is sum-free. Can we add another element? Let's try adding 5. Now check sums in {1,3,5}:\n\n1+1=2, not in set.\n\n1+3=4, not in set.\n\n1+5=6, not in set.\n\n3+3=6, not in set.\n\n3+5=8=1, which is in the set. So 3+5=1 is in the set. So adding 5 would create a problem. Therefore, cannot add 5.\n\nAdding 2: {1,2,3}. Then 1+2=3, which is in the set. So invalid.\n\nAdding 4: {1,3,4}. Check sums. 1+4=5, not in set. 3+4=7=0, not in set. 4+4=8=1, which is in the set. So 4+4=1 is in the set. Therefore, adding 4 is invalid.\n\nAdding 6: {1,3,6}. 1+6=7=0, not in set. 3+6=9=2, not in set. 6+6=12=5, not in set. So {1,3,6} is sum-free. Wait, but 1+3=4 not in set, 1+6=0 not in set, 3+6=2 not in set. So {1,3,6} is sum-free. So adding 6 to {1,3} gives a larger sum-free set, which means {1,3} wasn't maximal. Therefore, Z_7 does not have a maximal sum-free set of size 2.\n\nHmm, so Z_4 and Z_5 have them, but Z_7 doesn't. Let's check Z_5 in multiplicative terms. Wait, Z_5 is a cyclic group under addition. If considered as a multiplicative group, it's different. Wait, Z_5* (the multiplicative group modulo 5) has order 4 (elements 1,2,3,4). But that's a cyclic group of order 4. So in multiplicative terms, let's say, group isomorphic to Z_4. But we already considered Z_4 (additive) as having a product-free set of size 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps in multiplicative groups, product-free sets are different. Let's take the multiplicative group Z_5* (elements {1,2,3,4} with multiplication modulo 5). A product-free set here would require that no two elements multiply to give another element in the set. Let's try to find a set of size 2. For example, {2,3}. Check products: 2*2=4, not in set. 2*3=1, not in set. 3*3=4, not in set. So {2,3} is product-free. Is it maximal? Let's see if we can add another element. Adding 1: {1,2,3}. Then 1*2=2, which is in the set. So invalid. Adding 4: {2,3,4}. Now, 2*4=8=3 mod 5, which is in the set. So 2*4=3 is in the set. Invalid. So cannot add any element. So {2,3} is a maximal product-free set of size 2 in Z_5*. Therefore, the multiplicative group Z_5* (which is cyclic of order 4) has such a set.\n\nWait, but Z_5* is isomorphic to Z_4 (additive). So in additive Z_4, we had a sum-free set of size 2, and in multiplicative Z_5*, we have a product-free set of size 2. So both Z_4 and Z_5* have such sets. But Z_4 and Z_5* are isomorphic as groups (both cyclic of order 4). So maybe this counts as one group.\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of finite groups that contain such sets. So if multiple groups of the same order have them, but are isomorphic, they count as one. Wait, no. The question says \"how many finite groups contain...\". So each group counts once, even if they are isomorphic. Wait, but no, in group theory, when we count groups, we count them up to isomorphism. So the question is asking for the number of isomorphism classes of finite groups that contain such a set.\n\nTherefore, if two groups are isomorphic, they count as one. So for example, the additive group Z_4 and the multiplicative group Z_5* are both cyclic of order 4, hence isomorphic, so they are considered the same group for counting purposes.\n\nSo perhaps we need to consider each isomorphism class.\n\nLet's recap:\n\n- The cyclic group of order 4 (Z_4) has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\n- The cyclic group of order 5 (Z_5) has a maximal sum-free set of size 2 (in additive terms), but wait, the additive group Z_5's product-free set (sum-free) is {2,3}, which is maximal. However, in multiplicative terms, perhaps Z_5* is a different group (of order 4), but we already considered that. Wait, Z_5 under addition is a cyclic group of order 5. Its sum-free set {2,3} (additive) is of size 2 and maximal. So the additive group Z_5 (order 5) has such a set. The multiplicative group Z_5* is order 4, which we already considered.\n\nSo now, the additive group Z_5 (order 5) is another group. So perhaps Z_4 and Z_5 have such sets. Let's check Z_5's case.\n\nIn Z_5 (additive), the sum-free set {2,3} is of size 2. We saw that adding any element would violate the sum-free condition. But wait, when we add an element, say 4, let's check again. If we add 4 to {2,3}, we get {2,3,4}. Now, 2+3=5=0 mod5, which is not in the set. 2+4=6=1, not in set. 3+4=7=2, which is in the set. So 3+4=2 is in the set. Therefore, adding 4 would make the set not sum-free. Hence, the set {2,3} is indeed maximal. Therefore, Z_5 (additive cyclic group of order 5) is another group with such a set.\n\nSimilarly, let's check other small groups. The Klein four-group, V4 (elementary abelian group of order 4). Let's see if there's a product-free set of size 2 that's maximal. In Klein four-group, every element has order 2. Let's denote the elements as e, a, b, c, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e, and ab = c, etc.\n\nA product-free set S must satisfy that for any x, y in S, xy is not in S. Let's try to find a set of size 2. Take {a, b}. Then, ab = c, which is not in the set. a*a = e, not in the set. b*b = e, not in the set. So {a, b} is product-free. Is it maximal by inclusion? Let's see if adding e would make it not product-free. Adding e: {e, a, b}. Then e*a = a, which is in the set. So that's a problem. Can't add e. Adding c: {a, b, c}. Now, check products: a*b = c, which is now in the set. So that's a problem. So adding c invalidates the set. Therefore, {a, b} is maximal. So the Klein four-group has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So V4 is another group, non-cyclic, that has such a set.\n\nSo now we have three groups: Z_4, Z_5, and V4. Are there more?\n\nNext, check the symmetric group S3 (order 6). Let's see if S3 has a maximal product-free set of size 2. S3 has elements: identity, three transpositions (say (12), (13), (23)), and two 3-cycles ( (123), (132)).\n\nA product-free set of size 2. Let's pick two elements, say (12) and (13). Check products: (12)(13) = (132), which is a 3-cycle, not in the set. (12)(12) = identity, not in the set. (13)(13) = identity, not in the set. So { (12), (13) } is product-free. Is it maximal? Let's try adding another element, say (23). Now check products: (12)(23) = (123), which is not in the set. (13)(23) = (132), not in the set. Also, (23)(23) = identity. So adding (23) doesn't create a product within the set. Wait, but the new set is { (12), (13), (23) }. Let's check all products. (12)(13)=(132), not in set. (12)(23)=(123), not in set. (13)(23)=(132), not in set. The squares (each transposition squared is identity). So perhaps this set is product-free. Wait, but if the set includes three transpositions, then the product of any two transpositions is a 3-cycle, which is not in the set. So the set {all three transpositions} is product-free. Wait, but the original set was size 2; adding another element gives size 3. But if the set of three transpositions is product-free, then the original set {two transpositions} was not maximal, because we can add the third transposition. Therefore, { (12), (13) } is not maximal, because adding (23) results in a larger product-free set. Therefore, S3 does not have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another pair in S3. Let's try a transposition and a 3-cycle. For example, { (12), (123) }. Check products: (12)(123) = (23), which is not in the set. (123)(12) = (13), not in the set. (12)(12) = e, not in set. (123)(123) = (132), not in set. So this set is product-free. Is this maximal? Adding (23) gives { (12), (123), (23) }. Now, (12)(23) = (123), which is in the set. So adding (23) would mean that (12)(23) = (123) is in the set, which violates product-free. So cannot add (23). Adding e: {e, (12), (123)}. Then e*(12) = (12), which is in the set. So invalid. Adding (132): { (12), (123), (132) }. Check products: (123)(132) = e, not in set. (12)(123) = (23), not in set. (12)(132) = (23), not in set. (123)(123) = (132), which is in the set. Wait, (123) * (123) = (132). So if we have (123) and (132) in the set, their product (132) is in the set. So adding (132) would create a product within the set. So { (12), (123) } cannot be extended with (132). So maybe { (12), (123) } is maximal. Wait, but when we add (132), the product (123)*(123) = (132), which is in the set. So yes, that's a problem. So adding (132) is invalid. Similarly, try adding another element. Let's see, adding (13): { (12), (123), (13) }. Then (12)*(13) = (23), not in the set. (123)*(13) = (12), which is in the set. So that's bad. So adding (13) would create a product (123)*(13) = (12), which is in the set. Therefore, cannot add (13). Similarly, adding (23) as before. So perhaps { (12), (123) } is maximal. So in that case, S3 does have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nWait, but wait, let's verify if { (12), (123) } is product-free. The products are:\n\n(12)*(12) = e, not in the set.\n\n(12)*(123) = (23), not in the set.\n\n(123)*(12) = (13), not in the set.\n\n(123)*(123) = (132), not in the set.\n\nSo yes, this set is product-free. Now, can we add any other element without violating product-free?\n\nAdding e: e*(12)= (12) \u2208 set \u2192 invalid.\n\nAdding (13): check if (12)*(13) = (23) \u2209 set. (123)*(13) = (12) which is in the set. So adding (13) would mean that (123)*(13) = (12) is in the set. Therefore, invalid.\n\nAdding (23): (12)*(23)= (123) which is in the set. So invalid.\n\nAdding (132): (123)*(132) = e \u2209 set. (12)*(132) = (23) \u2209 set. However, (132)*(132) = (123) which is in the set. So (132)^2 = (123), which is in the set. So adding (132) would cause (132)*(132) = (123) \u2208 set. So invalid.\n\nThus, no other element can be added, so { (12), (123) } is a maximal product-free set of size 2 in S3. Therefore, S3 is another group with such a set.\n\nSo now we have four groups: Z_4, Z_5, V4, and S3. Wait, but I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me verify S3 again. Suppose we have the set { (12), (123) }.\n\n- (12) * (12) = e, not in set.\n\n- (12) * (123) = (23), not in set.\n\n- (123) * (12) = (13), not in set.\n\n- (123) * (123) = (132), not in set.\n\nSo indeed, no product is in the set. Now, trying to add (13):\n\n- (12) * (13) = (23), not in set.\n\n- (123) * (13) = (12), which is in the set. Hence, adding (13) would make the product (123)*(13) = (12), which is in the set. Therefore, invalid.\n\nAdding (132):\n\n- (132) * (132) = (123), which is in the set. So adding (132) leads to a product in the set.\n\nAdding e:\n\n- e * any element gives the element itself, which is in the set. So invalid.\n\nAdding (23):\n\n- (12) * (23) = (123), which is in the set. So invalid.\n\nAdding (132) as above.\n\nThus, { (12), (123) } is maximal. Therefore, S3 does have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nSo now we have four groups: Z_4, Z_5, V4, and S3.\n\nAre there others?\n\nLet's check the quaternion group Q8 (order 8). Elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}. Product rules: i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, ij = k, jk = i, ki = j, etc.\n\nLooking for a product-free set of size 2. Let's pick two elements, say i and j. Check products: i*j = k, not in the set. i*i = -1, not in set. j*j = -1, not in set. So {i, j} is product-free. Now, is it maximal? Can we add another element? Let's try adding k. Then, i*j = k, which is now in the set. So adding k would mean that the product i*j = k is in the set. Therefore, {i, j, k} is not product-free. So cannot add k. Adding -i: {i, j, -i}. Check products: (-i)*i = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1, not in set. (-i)*j = -k, not in set. j*(-i) = -k, not in set. But (-i)*(-i) = i^2 = -1, not in set. So perhaps adding -i is allowed. Wait, is the product of -i and j in the set? The set is {i, j, -i}. The product (-i)*j = - (i*j) = -k, which is not in the set. Similarly, product j*(-i) = -k. So no products would be in the set. Wait, but what about i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1, not in the set. So {i, j, -i} would be product-free. Therefore, {i, j} is not maximal because we can add -i.\n\nWait, but the set {i, j, -i} is product-free? Let's check all possible products:\n\ni*i = -1 \u2209 set.\n\ni*j = k \u2209 set.\n\ni*(-i) = 1 \u2209 set.\n\nj*i = -k \u2209 set.\n\nj*j = -1 \u2209 set.\n\nj*(-i) = -k \u2209 set.\n\n(-i)*i = 1 \u2209 set.\n\n(-i)*j = -k \u2209 set.\n\n(-i)*(-i) = -1 \u2209 set.\n\nSo indeed, all products are not in the set. So {i, j, -i} is product-free. Therefore, the original set {i, j} is not maximal. So Q8 doesn't have a maximal product-free set of size 2. Maybe another pair?\n\nLet's try {i, -i}. Products: i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1, not in set. i*i = -1, not in set. (-i)*(-i) = -1, not in set. So {i, -i} is product-free. Can we add j? Check products: i*j = k \u2209 set. (-i)*j = -k \u2209 set. j*j = -1 \u2209 set. So {i, -i, j} is product-free. So again, the original set was not maximal. Therefore, Q8 doesn't have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nWhat about other pairs? {i, k}. Products: i*k = -j, not in set. i*i = -1, not in set. k*k = -1, not in set. So {i, k} is product-free. Adding j: {i, k, j}. Then i*j = k, which is in the set. So invalid. Adding -i: {i, k, -i}. Check products: i*k = -j \u2209 set. i*(-i) = 1 \u2209 set. k*(-i) = j \u2209 set. So {i, k, -i} is product-free. So again, original set is not maximal. Hence, Q8 may not have such sets.\n\nSo far, the groups we have are:\n\n1. Z_4 (cyclic group of order 4)\n2. Z_5 (cyclic group of order 5)\n3. V4 (Klein four-group, elementary abelian of order 4)\n4. S3 (symmetric group on 3 elements, order 6)\n\nLet me check another group: the dihedral group D4 (order 8). D4 has elements {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r is rotation and s is reflection.\n\nLooking for a product-free set of size 2. Let's take two elements: s and sr. Their products: s*s = e, not in set. s*sr = r^3 (since s sr = r^{-1} = r^3 in D4). r^3 is not in the set. sr*s = r (since sr s = r^{ -1} r = r^{-1}? Wait, maybe I need to be careful with the multiplication rules. In D4, s r = r^{-1} s. So (sr)(s) = r^{-1} s s = r^{-1} e = r^3. So product sr*s = r^3, which is not in the set {s, sr}. So {s, sr} is product-free. Now, can we add another element? Let's try adding sr^2. The set becomes {s, sr, sr^2}. Check products: s*sr^2 = r^{-2} s s = r^2. Not in the set. sr*sr^2 = s r^{-1} sr^2 = s s r r^{-1} r^2 = e r^2 = r^2, not in the set. So no immediate issues. Wait, but need to check all products. s*s = e \u2209 set. sr*sr = s r^{-1} s r = s s r r^{-1} r = e r^2 = r^2 \u2209 set. s*sr = r^3 \u2209 set. etc. So {s, sr, sr^2} may be product-free. Therefore, {s, sr} is not maximal. Hence, D4 does not have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nAlternatively, pick two elements like r and s. Products: r*s = sr^{-1} = sr^3, not in set. s*r = sr, not in set. r*r = r^2, not in set. s*s = e, not in set. So {r, s} is product-free. Can we add sr? Then products: r*sr = s r^{-1} r = s, which is in the set. So adding sr would lead to r*sr = s \u2208 set. Invalid. So {r, s} is maximal? Wait, can we add another element without causing a product? Suppose we add r^2. The set becomes {r, s, r^2}. Check products: r*r^2 = r^3 \u2209 set. r*s = sr^3 \u2209 set. s*r^2 = sr^2 \u2209 set. r^2*r^2 = r^4 = e \u2209 set. So maybe {r, s, r^2} is product-free. If so, then {r, s} is not maximal. It's unclear. Let me check more carefully.\n\nIf we add r^2 to {r, s}, new set {r, s, r^2}:\n\n- r*r = r^2 \u2208 set. So product r*r = r^2, which is in the set. Therefore, adding r^2 would make the set not product-free. Hence, cannot add r^2.\n\nTrying to add sr^2:\n\nSet {r, s, sr^2}. Check products:\n\nr*sr^2 = s r^{-1} r^2 = s r. But s r = sr, which is not in the set.\n\ns*r = sr \u2209 set.\n\ns*sr^2 = r^{-2} s s = r^2 \u2209 set.\n\nsr^2* sr^2 = (sr^2)^2 = e \u2209 set.\n\nr*sr^2 = sr^{-1} r^2 = sr.\n\nSo no products within the set. So {r, s, sr^2} might be product-free. So in that case, the original set {r, s} is not maximal. Therefore, D4 doesn't have such a set.\n\nNow, considering all the groups we've looked at, the ones that do have maximal product-free sets of size 2 are:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 4 (Z_4)\n2. Cyclic group of order 5 (Z_5)\n3. Klein four-group (V4)\n4. Symmetric group S3 (order 6)\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLet's check the cyclic group of order 6, Z_6. In additive terms, sum-free sets. The elements are 0,1,2,3,4,5. A sum-free set of size 2. For example, {1,3} as before. Can we add another element? Like 5. {1,3,5}. 1+3=4 not in set. 1+5=6=0 not in set. 3+5=8=2 not in set. So {1,3,5} is sum-free. Therefore, {1,3} is not maximal. Thus, Z_6 doesn't qualify.\n\nHow about the cyclic group of order 3, Z_3. As we saw earlier, no sum-free sets of size 2. Similarly for order 2, order 1. So no.\n\nCheck the cyclic group of order 7, Z_7. As before, a sum-free set {2,3} can be extended to {2,3,5} or similar, so no.\n\nAnother group: the dihedral group D3 (order 6), which is actually isomorphic to S3. So we've already counted that.\n\nWhat about the quaternion group of order 8? We saw that it doesn't have such a set.\n\nWhat about the cyclic group of order 8, Z_8? Let's check sum-free sets. {1,3} in Z_8. 1+1=2, 1+3=4, 3+3=6. None in the set. Can we add 5? {1,3,5}. 1+5=6, 3+5=8=0, 1+3=4. None in the set. So {1,3,5} is sum-free. Therefore, {1,3} is not maximal. So Z_8 does not have such a set.\n\nAre there any other groups of order up to 8?\n\nThe groups up to order 8 are:\n\nOrder 1: trivial group.\n\nOrder 2: Z_2.\n\nOrder 3: Z_3.\n\nOrder 4: Z_4, V4.\n\nOrder 5: Z_5.\n\nOrder 6: Z_6, S3.\n\nOrder 7: Z_7.\n\nOrder 8: Z_8, Z_4\u00d7Z_2, Z_2\u00d7Z_2\u00d7Z_2, D4, Q8.\n\nWe've checked these. So the only groups with such sets are Z_4, Z_5, V4, and S3.\n\nWait, but wait. The group Z_4 (cyclic of order 4), V4 (Klein four), S3 (symmetric group of order 6), and Z_5 (cyclic of order 5). So four groups.\n\nBut let's confirm with examples.\n\nFor V4: We had the set {a, b}, which is product-free and maximal.\n\nFor Z_4: {1,3} is sum-free and maximal.\n\nFor Z_5: {2,3} is sum-free and maximal.\n\nFor S3: { (12), (123) } is product-free and maximal.\n\nAre there any other groups beyond these four? Let me think about order 7 and above. For example, Z_7 doesn't work. What about non-abelian groups of order 8, like D4 and Q8, which we checked and saw they don't have such sets.\n\nWhat about the group Z_3 \u00d7 Z_3 (order 9). Let's consider sum-free sets here. In additive terms, a sum-free set is a set with no two elements adding to another. Let's see if such a set of size 2 exists. Take two elements like (1,0) and (0,1). Their sum is (1,1), which is not in the set. So the set {(1,0), (0,1)} is sum-free. Is it maximal? Adding (2,2) (assuming elements are ordered pairs). Check if adding (2,2) would create any sums. The set becomes {(1,0), (0,1), (2,2)}. Check sums:\n\n(1,0) + (0,1) = (1,1) \u2209 set.\n\n(1,0) + (2,2) = (0,2) \u2209 set.\n\n(0,1) + (2,2) = (2,0) \u2209 set.\n\nSo maybe this is sum-free. Therefore, the original set wasn't maximal. So Z_3 \u00d7 Z_3 doesn't qualify.\n\nTherefore, up to order 8, only the four groups mentioned earlier have maximal product-free sets of size 2.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for finite groups in general, not just up to a certain order. However, considering that the question requires counting the number of finite groups with this property, and since there are infinitely many finite groups, but the answer is likely a small finite number. Since in cyclic groups of order 4 and 5, and in Klein four-group and S3, we have examples, and larger groups don't seem to have such sets, perhaps the answer is 4.\n\nBut I need to confirm if there are any other groups beyond these four.\n\nWait, let's consider another non-abelian group of order 12, like A4 (alternating group on 4 letters). Let's see if it has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nA4 has elements consisting of even permutations. It has 12 elements: the identity, eight 3-cycles, and three double transpositions (products of two disjoint transpositions).\n\nLet's try to find a product-free set of size 2. Take two 3-cycles, say (123) and (124). Their products: (123)(124) = (12)(34), which is a double transposition. (124)(123) = (13)(24). So neither product is in the set. Also, (123)(123) = (132), and (124)(124) = (142). So squares of elements are other 3-cycles not in the set. So the set {(123), (124)} is product-free. Is it maximal? Let's try adding another element, say (132). Now, check products: (123)*(132) = e (the identity), not in the set. (124)*(132) = (1)(2 4 3) = (243), a 3-cycle not in the set. (132)*(132) = (123), which is in the set. Oh, so (132)^2 = (123), which is in the set. Therefore, adding (132) would result in a product within the set. Hence, cannot add (132). Adding a double transposition, say (12)(34). Check products: (123)*(12)(34) = (1)(3)(2 4), which is (24), a transposition, not in A4. Wait, but (12)(34) multiplied by (123) would be (134). Let me compute correctly:\n\n(123)*(12)(34) = (1)(2 3) * (1 2)(3 4) = ?\n\nWait, permutation multiplication is done right-to-left. So (123) is a cycle sending 1\u21922, 2\u21923, 3\u21921. Then (12)(34) swaps 1\u21942 and 3\u21944.\n\nSo applying (12)(34) first, then (123). Let's calculate:\n\nLet\u2019s compute (123) * (12)(34):\n\nStart with element 1:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34): 1 \u2192 2.\n\nThen apply (123): 2 \u2192 3.\n\nSo overall, 1 \u2192 3.\n\nElement 2:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34): 2 \u2192 1.\n\nThen apply (123): 1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo 2 \u2192 2.\n\nElement 3:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34): 3 \u21924.\n\nThen apply (123): 4 \u21924 (since (123) doesn't affect 4).\n\nSo 3 \u21924.\n\nElement 4:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34): 4 \u21923.\n\nThen apply (123): 3 \u21921.\n\nSo 4 \u21921.\n\nThus, the product is the permutation (1 3 4), a 3-cycle not in the set. Similarly, (12)(34) * (123) would give another permutation. Regardless, the product is not in the set. Therefore, adding (12)(34) to {(123), (124)} gives a set { (123), (124), (12)(34) }, which may still be product-free. Wait, check all products:\n\n(123)*(12)(34) = (1 3 4), not in set.\n\n(124)*(12)(34) = Let's compute:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34) to each element:\n\n1\u21922, 2\u21921, 3\u21924, 4\u21923.\n\nThen apply (124):\n\n1\u21922, 2\u21924, 4\u21921, 3\u21923.\n\nSo overall:\n\nFor element 1:\n\nApply (12)(34): 1\u21922, then (124): 2\u21924. So 1\u21924.\n\nFor element 2:\n\nApply (12)(34): 2\u21921, then (124): 1\u21922. So 2\u21922.\n\nFor element 4:\n\nApply (12)(34): 4\u21923, then (124): 3\u21923. So 4\u21923.\n\nFor element 3:\n\nApply (12)(34): 3\u21924, then (124): 4\u21921. So 3\u21921.\n\nThus, the permutation is (1 4 3), a 3-cycle not in the set. So (124)*(12)(34) = (143) \u2209 set.\n\n products between (12)(34) and others:\n\n(12)(34)*(123) = Let's compute:\n\nFirst apply (123), then (12)(34).\n\nElement 1:\n\nApply (123): 1\u21922, then (12)(34): 2\u21921. So 1\u21921.\n\nElement 2:\n\nApply (123): 2\u21923, then (12)(34): 3\u21924. So 2\u21924.\n\nElement 3:\n\nApply (123): 3\u21921, then (12)(34): 1\u21922. So 3\u21922.\n\nElement 4:\n\nApply (123): 4\u21924, then (12)(34): 4\u21923. So 4\u21923.\n\nThus, the product is (2 4 3), which is (243) a 3-cycle not in the set.\n\nSo all products are not in the set. Therefore, the set { (123), (124), (12)(34) } is product-free. Hence, the original set { (123), (124) } is not maximal. Therefore, A4 does not have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nThis suggests that there are no such groups beyond the four we've identified: Z_4, Z_5, V4, and S3.\n\nTherefore, the number of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 is 4.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: A maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 means no third element can be added without violating the product-free condition.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking how many finite groups have maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. Hmm, product-free sets. I remember that a product-free set in a group is a subset where no two elements multiply to give another element in the set. So, a set S is product-free if for any a, b in S, the product ab is not in S.\n\nNow, the question is about maximal by inclusion such sets of size 2. Maximal by inclusion means that you can't add any other element from the group to the set without violating the product-free condition. So, there's a set with two elements, and adding any third element would create a situation where two elements multiply to give another in the set.\n\nThe question is asking for the number of finite groups that contain such sets. So, how many different finite groups have at least one maximal product-free set of size 2?\n\nFirst, I need to think about small finite groups. Let's start with the smallest groups: the trivial group, which has only the identity element. But a product-free set in the trivial group would be empty since the only element multiplied by itself is itself. But the question is about sets of size 2, so the trivial group is out.\n\nNext, cyclic groups. Let's look at cyclic groups of small order. Let's start with order 2: Z_2. The elements are 0 and 1. A product-free set of size 2 would need two elements, but the group itself has only two elements. But in Z_2 under addition, the operation is addition modulo 2. Wait, product-free here would be additive, but the term \"product-free\" is usually in multiplicative groups. Wait, but maybe in additive groups, the term translates to sum-free sets. So perhaps in additive groups, a sum-free set is a set where no two elements add up to another element in the set. So in Z_2, a sum-free set would have to be such that if you take two elements (but there are only two elements, 0 and 1), their sum (mod 2) can't be in the set. Let's check. Suppose the set is {0,1}. Then 0+1=1, which is in the set. So that's not sum-free. The only other possible set of size 2 is the entire group, which isn't sum-free. So Z_2 can't have a product-free (sum-free) set of size 2. So Z_2 is out.\n\nNext, Z_3. Elements are 0,1,2. A sum-free set here. Let me recall that in additive cyclic groups, a sum-free set is a set where no two elements add up to another. For Z_3, the maximum size of a sum-free set is 1, because if you take two elements, say {1,2}, then 1+1=2, which is in the set. Alternatively, {1} is sum-free. But size 2 would require two elements. Let's see. For example, {1,2}: 1+1=2, which is in the set. So that's not sum-free. {0,1}: 0+1=1, which is in the set. Not sum-free. Any two elements in Z_3 would have this problem. So sum-free sets in Z_3 can't have size 2. So Z_3 doesn't work.\n\nZ_4. Elements 0,1,2,3. Let's look for sum-free sets. The largest sum-free set in Z_4 is size 1. Because, for example, {1,3} would have 1+3=0, which isn't in the set. Wait, but 1+1=2, which isn't in {1,3}. Wait, maybe {1,3} is sum-free. Let's check. 1+1=2 (not in the set). 1+3=0 (not in the set). 3+3=2 (not in the set). So actually, {1,3} is sum-free. So size 2. Now, is this maximal by inclusion? Can we add another element without violating the sum-free condition? Let's see. The remaining elements are 0 and 2. Adding 0: check if adding 0 would create any sums. The set becomes {0,1,3}. Now, 0+1=1 (in the set). So that's bad. So adding 0 would make it not sum-free. Adding 2: check {1,3,2}. Now, 2+2=0 (not in the set). 2+1=3 (which is in the set). So 1+2=3, which is in the set. So adding 2 would create a sum (1+2=3) in the set. So neither 0 nor 2 can be added. Therefore, {1,3} is a maximal sum-free set of size 2 in Z_4. So Z_4 is a candidate.\n\nSo Z_4 has such a set. Therefore, at least one group (Z_4) works.\n\nNext, Z_5. Let's check sum-free sets. The maximum size of a sum-free set in Z_5 should be 2. For example, {2,3}? Let's check. 2+2=4, which is not in the set. 2+3=0, which is not in the set. 3+3=1, which is not in the set. So {2,3} is sum-free. Now, can we add another element? Let's try adding 4. The set becomes {2,3,4}. Check sums: 2+4=1 (not in set), 3+4=2 (which is in the set). So 3+4=2 would be a problem. Therefore, adding 4 would make the set not sum-free. Similarly, adding 1: check sums with existing elements. 1+2=3 (in the set). So adding 1 would create a problem. Similarly, adding 0: 0+2=2 (in the set). So adding 0 is bad. Therefore, {2,3} is maximal. So Z_5 also has a maximal sum-free set of size 2.\n\nWait, but the question is about product-free sets. Wait, but in additive groups, product-free would be sum-free? Hmm. Wait, the problem statement uses \"product-free\", which in multiplicative groups would mean no two elements multiply to another. But in additive groups, the analogous concept would be sum-free (no two elements add to another). But the term \"product-free\" here might be in multiplicative groups. Wait, but the question is about finite groups in general, not necessarily abelian. So perhaps in multiplicative non-abelian groups, but the concept is the same: a product-free set S where for any a, b in S, the product ab is not in S.\n\nSo, for example, in the multiplicative group of integers modulo n (when possible). But for cyclic groups like Z_4 under addition, perhaps the question is considering them as additive groups, but product-free in additive groups would actually be sum-free. Hmm, this is a possible confusion point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses \"product-free\" in the general group sense, so in additive groups, product would be the group operation (addition). So, in additive groups, product-free would mean that for any a, b in the set, a + b is not in the set. So, in additive groups, product-free is equivalent to sum-free.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about multiplicative groups, but for finite groups in general, both additive and multiplicative. Wait, no, all groups are considered with their respective operations. So, the question is about finite groups, regardless of their operation. So in additive groups (like cyclic groups under addition), a product-free set would be a set where the sum of any two elements is not in the set.\n\nSo, the problem is general. Now, the question is: how many finite groups contain such a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nSo, I need to check for each finite group whether it has such a set.\n\nLet's consider first the cyclic groups of small order.\n\nWe saw that Z_4 (cyclic group of order 4) has such a set {1,3} (in additive notation, but equivalent to {a, a^3} in multiplicative terms if the group is written multiplicatively). Similarly, Z_5 has a set {2,3} (additive), which is sum-free and maximal by inclusion.\n\nWait, but in Z_5, the maximal sum-free set {2,3} is size 2. But is it maximal? Adding 4: 2+4=1, 3+4=2. So adding 4 would create a problem when 3+4=2 is in the original set? Wait, in the set {2,3,4}, 3+4=2, which is in the set. So that's not allowed. Therefore, adding 4 is invalid. Similarly, adding 1: 2+1=3 (in the set). Adding 0: 0+2=2 (in the set). So yes, the set {2,3} is maximal.\n\nBut the question is about maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. So in Z_4 and Z_5, such sets exist. But wait, but then maybe also in larger cyclic groups?\n\nWait, but in Z_6, let's check. Let's look for a product-free (sum-free) set of size 2. For example, {1,3}. Check sums: 1+1=2, not in the set. 1+3=4, not in the set. 3+3=0, not in the set. So {1,3} is sum-free. Now, is it maximal? Adding 2: {1,2,3}. Then 1+2=3, which is in the set. So cannot add 2. Adding 4: 1+4=5, not in the set. 3+4=1, which is in the set. So adding 4 would lead to 3+4=1 in the set. So can't add 4. Adding 5: {1,3,5}. Now, 1+5=0, not present. 3+5=2, not present. 5+5=4, not present. So maybe {1,3,5} is sum-free. Wait, does that work?\n\nWait, in {1,3,5}:\n\n1+1=2 (not in set)\n\n1+3=4 (not in set)\n\n1+5=6=0 (mod 6) (not in set)\n\n3+3=6=0 (not in set)\n\n3+5=8=2 (not in set)\n\n5+5=10=4 (not in set)\n\nSo {1,3,5} is sum-free. So adding 5 to {1,3} gives a larger sum-free set. Therefore, the original set {1,3} is not maximal by inclusion. So in Z_6, the maximal sum-free sets must be larger. Therefore, Z_6 may have larger maximal sum-free sets, so the set of size 2 is not maximal. Therefore, Z_6 does not count.\n\nSo, perhaps only certain cyclic groups have such sets. Let's check Z_4 and Z_5.\n\nWait, but earlier in Z_5, the set {2,3} is maximal. Let's check if you can add any element to it. The other elements are 0,1,4. Adding 0: {0,2,3}. Then 0+2=2, which is in the set. So invalid. Adding 1: {1,2,3}. Then 1+2=3, which is in the set. Invalid. Adding 4: {2,3,4}. Then 3+4=2, which is in the set. So can't add anything. So yes, {2,3} is maximal. So Z_5 is okay.\n\nBut in Z_6, as we saw, the set {1,3} can be extended to {1,3,5}, which is sum-free. So {1,3} is not maximal. Therefore, Z_6 doesn't have a maximal sum-free set of size 2.\n\nSo far, Z_4 and Z_5 are candidates. Are there others?\n\nLet me check Z_7. Let's see if there's a sum-free set of size 2 that's maximal. Let's pick {1,3}. Check sums: 1+1=2, 1+3=4, 3+3=6. None are in the set. So {1,3} is sum-free. Can we add another element? Let's try adding 5. Now check sums in {1,3,5}:\n\n1+1=2, not in set.\n\n1+3=4, not in set.\n\n1+5=6, not in set.\n\n3+3=6, not in set.\n\n3+5=8=1, which is in the set. So 3+5=1 is in the set. So adding 5 would create a problem. Therefore, cannot add 5.\n\nAdding 2: {1,2,3}. Then 1+2=3, which is in the set. So invalid.\n\nAdding 4: {1,3,4}. Check sums. 1+4=5, not in set. 3+4=7=0, not in set. 4+4=8=1, which is in the set. So 4+4=1 is in the set. Therefore, adding 4 is invalid.\n\nAdding 6: {1,3,6}. 1+6=7=0, not in set. 3+6=9=2, not in set. 6+6=12=5, not in set. So {1,3,6} is sum-free. Wait, but 1+3=4 not in set, 1+6=0 not in set, 3+6=2 not in set. So {1,3,6} is sum-free. So adding 6 to {1,3} gives a larger sum-free set, which means {1,3} wasn't maximal. Therefore, Z_7 does not have a maximal sum-free set of size 2.\n\nHmm, so Z_4 and Z_5 have them, but Z_7 doesn't. Let's check Z_5 in multiplicative terms. Wait, Z_5 is a cyclic group under addition. If considered as a multiplicative group, it's different. Wait, Z_5* (the multiplicative group modulo 5) has order 4 (elements 1,2,3,4). But that's a cyclic group of order 4. So in multiplicative terms, let's say, group isomorphic to Z_4. But we already considered Z_4 (additive) as having a product-free set of size 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps in multiplicative groups, product-free sets are different. Let's take the multiplicative group Z_5* (elements {1,2,3,4} with multiplication modulo 5). A product-free set here would require that no two elements multiply to give another element in the set. Let's try to find a set of size 2. For example, {2,3}. Check products: 2*2=4, not in set. 2*3=1, not in set. 3*3=4, not in set. So {2,3} is product-free. Is it maximal? Let's see if we can add another element. Adding 1: {1,2,3}. Then 1*2=2, which is in the set. So invalid. Adding 4: {2,3,4}. Now, 2*4=8=3 mod 5, which is in the set. So 2*4=3 is in the set. Invalid. So cannot add any element. So {2,3} is a maximal product-free set of size 2 in Z_5*. Therefore, the multiplicative group Z_5* (which is cyclic of order 4) has such a set.\n\nWait, but Z_5* is isomorphic to Z_4 (additive). So in additive Z_4, we had a sum-free set of size 2, and in multiplicative Z_5*, we have a product-free set of size 2. So both Z_4 and Z_5* have such sets. But Z_4 and Z_5* are isomorphic as groups (both cyclic of order 4). So maybe this counts as one group.\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of finite groups that contain such sets. So if multiple groups of the same order have them, but are isomorphic, they count as one. Wait, no. The question says \"how many finite groups contain...\". So each group counts once, even if they are isomorphic. Wait, but no, in group theory, when we count groups, we count them up to isomorphism. So the question is asking for the number of isomorphism classes of finite groups that contain such a set.\n\nTherefore, if two groups are isomorphic, they count as one. So for example, the additive group Z_4 and the multiplicative group Z_5* are both cyclic of order 4, hence isomorphic, so they are considered the same group for counting purposes.\n\nSo perhaps we need to consider each isomorphism class.\n\nLet's recap:\n\n- The cyclic group of order 4 (Z_4) has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\n- The cyclic group of order 5 (Z_5) has a maximal sum-free set of size 2 (in additive terms), but wait, the additive group Z_5's product-free set (sum-free) is {2,3}, which is maximal. However, in multiplicative terms, perhaps Z_5* is a different group (of order 4), but we already considered that. Wait, Z_5 under addition is a cyclic group of order 5. Its sum-free set {2,3} (additive) is of size 2 and maximal. So the additive group Z_5 (order 5) has such a set. The multiplicative group Z_5* is order 4, which we already considered.\n\nSo now, the additive group Z_5 (order 5) is another group. So perhaps Z_4 and Z_5 have such sets. Let's check Z_5's case.\n\nIn Z_5 (additive), the sum-free set {2,3} is of size 2. We saw that adding any element would violate the sum-free condition. But wait, when we add an element, say 4, let's check again. If we add 4 to {2,3}, we get {2,3,4}. Now, 2+3=5=0 mod5, which is not in the set. 2+4=6=1, not in set. 3+4=7=2, which is in the set. So 3+4=2 is in the set. Therefore, adding 4 would make the set not sum-free. Hence, the set {2,3} is indeed maximal. Therefore, Z_5 (additive cyclic group of order 5) is another group with such a set.\n\nSimilarly, let's check other small groups. The Klein four-group, V4 (elementary abelian group of order 4). Let's see if there's a product-free set of size 2 that's maximal. In Klein four-group, every element has order 2. Let's denote the elements as e, a, b, c, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e, and ab = c, etc.\n\nA product-free set S must satisfy that for any x, y in S, xy is not in S. Let's try to find a set of size 2. Take {a, b}. Then, ab = c, which is not in the set. a*a = e, not in the set. b*b = e, not in the set. So {a, b} is product-free. Is it maximal by inclusion? Let's see if adding e would make it not product-free. Adding e: {e, a, b}. Then e*a = a, which is in the set. So that's a problem. Can't add e. Adding c: {a, b, c}. Now, check products: a*b = c, which is now in the set. So that's a problem. So adding c invalidates the set. Therefore, {a, b} is maximal. So the Klein four-group has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So V4 is another group, non-cyclic, that has such a set.\n\nSo now we have three groups: Z_4, Z_5, and V4. Are there more?\n\nNext, check the symmetric group S3 (order 6). Let's see if S3 has a maximal product-free set of size 2. S3 has elements: identity, three transpositions (say (12), (13), (23)), and two 3-cycles ( (123), (132)).\n\nA product-free set of size 2. Let's pick two elements, say (12) and (13). Check products: (12)(13) = (132), which is a 3-cycle, not in the set. (12)(12) = identity, not in the set. (13)(13) = identity, not in the set. So { (12), (13) } is product-free. Is it maximal? Let's try adding another element, say (23). Now check products: (12)(23) = (123), which is not in the set. (13)(23) = (132), not in the set. Also, (23)(23) = identity. So adding (23) doesn't create a product within the set. Wait, but the new set is { (12), (13), (23) }. Let's check all products. (12)(13)=(132), not in set. (12)(23)=(123), not in set. (13)(23)=(132), not in set. The squares (each transposition squared is identity). So perhaps this set is product-free. Wait, but if the set includes three transpositions, then the product of any two transpositions is a 3-cycle, which is not in the set. So the set {all three transpositions} is product-free. Wait, but the original set was size 2; adding another element gives size 3. But if the set of three transpositions is product-free, then the original set {two transpositions} was not maximal, because we can add the third transposition. Therefore, { (12), (13) } is not maximal, because adding (23) results in a larger product-free set. Therefore, S3 does not have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another pair in S3. Let's try a transposition and a 3-cycle. For example, { (12), (123) }. Check products: (12)(123) = (23), which is not in the set. (123)(12) = (13), not in the set. (12)(12) = e, not in set. (123)(123) = (132), not in set. So this set is product-free. Is this maximal? Adding (23) gives { (12), (123), (23) }. Now, (12)(23) = (123), which is in the set. So adding (23) would mean that (12)(23) = (123) is in the set, which violates product-free. So cannot add (23). Adding e: {e, (12), (123)}. Then e*(12) = (12), which is in the set. So invalid. Adding (132): { (12), (123), (132) }. Check products: (123)(132) = e, not in set. (12)(123) = (23), not in set. (12)(132) = (23), not in set. (123)(123) = (132), which is in the set. Wait, (123) * (123) = (132). So if we have (123) and (132) in the set, their product (132) is in the set. So adding (132) would create a product within the set. So { (12), (123) } cannot be extended with (132). So maybe { (12), (123) } is maximal. Wait, but when we add (132), the product (123)*(123) = (132), which is in the set. So yes, that's a problem. So adding (132) is invalid. Similarly, try adding another element. Let's see, adding (13): { (12), (123), (13) }. Then (12)*(13) = (23), not in the set. (123)*(13) = (12), which is in the set. So that's bad. So adding (13) would create a product (123)*(13) = (12), which is in the set. Therefore, cannot add (13). Similarly, adding (23) as before. So perhaps { (12), (123) } is maximal. So in that case, S3 does have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nWait, but wait, let's verify if { (12), (123) } is product-free. The products are:\n\n(12)*(12) = e, not in the set.\n\n(12)*(123) = (23), not in the set.\n\n(123)*(12) = (13), not in the set.\n\n(123)*(123) = (132), not in the set.\n\nSo yes, this set is product-free. Now, can we add any other element without violating product-free?\n\nAdding e: e*(12)= (12) \u2208 set \u2192 invalid.\n\nAdding (13): check if (12)*(13) = (23) \u2209 set. (123)*(13) = (12) which is in the set. So adding (13) would mean that (123)*(13) = (12) is in the set. Therefore, invalid.\n\nAdding (23): (12)*(23)= (123) which is in the set. So invalid.\n\nAdding (132): (123)*(132) = e \u2209 set. (12)*(132) = (23) \u2209 set. However, (132)*(132) = (123) which is in the set. So (132)^2 = (123), which is in the set. So adding (132) would cause (132)*(132) = (123) \u2208 set. So invalid.\n\nThus, no other element can be added, so { (12), (123) } is a maximal product-free set of size 2 in S3. Therefore, S3 is another group with such a set.\n\nSo now we have four groups: Z_4, Z_5, V4, and S3. Wait, but I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me verify S3 again. Suppose we have the set { (12), (123) }.\n\n- (12) * (12) = e, not in set.\n\n- (12) * (123) = (23), not in set.\n\n- (123) * (12) = (13), not in set.\n\n- (123) * (123) = (132), not in set.\n\nSo indeed, no product is in the set. Now, trying to add (13):\n\n- (12) * (13) = (23), not in set.\n\n- (123) * (13) = (12), which is in the set. Hence, adding (13) would make the product (123)*(13) = (12), which is in the set. Therefore, invalid.\n\nAdding (132):\n\n- (132) * (132) = (123), which is in the set. So adding (132) leads to a product in the set.\n\nAdding e:\n\n- e * any element gives the element itself, which is in the set. So invalid.\n\nAdding (23):\n\n- (12) * (23) = (123), which is in the set. So invalid.\n\nAdding (132) as above.\n\nThus, { (12), (123) } is maximal. Therefore, S3 does have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nSo now we have four groups: Z_4, Z_5, V4, and S3.\n\nAre there others?\n\nLet's check the quaternion group Q8 (order 8). Elements {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}. Product rules: i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, ij = k, jk = i, ki = j, etc.\n\nLooking for a product-free set of size 2. Let's pick two elements, say i and j. Check products: i*j = k, not in the set. i*i = -1, not in set. j*j = -1, not in set. So {i, j} is product-free. Now, is it maximal? Can we add another element? Let's try adding k. Then, i*j = k, which is now in the set. So adding k would mean that the product i*j = k is in the set. Therefore, {i, j, k} is not product-free. So cannot add k. Adding -i: {i, j, -i}. Check products: (-i)*i = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1, not in set. (-i)*j = -k, not in set. j*(-i) = -k, not in set. But (-i)*(-i) = i^2 = -1, not in set. So perhaps adding -i is allowed. Wait, is the product of -i and j in the set? The set is {i, j, -i}. The product (-i)*j = - (i*j) = -k, which is not in the set. Similarly, product j*(-i) = -k. So no products would be in the set. Wait, but what about i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1, not in the set. So {i, j, -i} would be product-free. Therefore, {i, j} is not maximal because we can add -i.\n\nWait, but the set {i, j, -i} is product-free? Let's check all possible products:\n\ni*i = -1 \u2209 set.\n\ni*j = k \u2209 set.\n\ni*(-i) = 1 \u2209 set.\n\nj*i = -k \u2209 set.\n\nj*j = -1 \u2209 set.\n\nj*(-i) = -k \u2209 set.\n\n(-i)*i = 1 \u2209 set.\n\n(-i)*j = -k \u2209 set.\n\n(-i)*(-i) = -1 \u2209 set.\n\nSo indeed, all products are not in the set. So {i, j, -i} is product-free. Therefore, the original set {i, j} is not maximal. So Q8 doesn't have a maximal product-free set of size 2. Maybe another pair?\n\nLet's try {i, -i}. Products: i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1, not in set. i*i = -1, not in set. (-i)*(-i) = -1, not in set. So {i, -i} is product-free. Can we add j? Check products: i*j = k \u2209 set. (-i)*j = -k \u2209 set. j*j = -1 \u2209 set. So {i, -i, j} is product-free. So again, the original set was not maximal. Therefore, Q8 doesn't have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nWhat about other pairs? {i, k}. Products: i*k = -j, not in set. i*i = -1, not in set. k*k = -1, not in set. So {i, k} is product-free. Adding j: {i, k, j}. Then i*j = k, which is in the set. So invalid. Adding -i: {i, k, -i}. Check products: i*k = -j \u2209 set. i*(-i) = 1 \u2209 set. k*(-i) = j \u2209 set. So {i, k, -i} is product-free. So again, original set is not maximal. Hence, Q8 may not have such sets.\n\nSo far, the groups we have are:\n\n1. Z_4 (cyclic group of order 4)\n2. Z_5 (cyclic group of order 5)\n3. V4 (Klein four-group, elementary abelian of order 4)\n4. S3 (symmetric group on 3 elements, order 6)\n\nLet me check another group: the dihedral group D4 (order 8). D4 has elements {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}, where r is rotation and s is reflection.\n\nLooking for a product-free set of size 2. Let's take two elements: s and sr. Their products: s*s = e, not in set. s*sr = r^3 (since s sr = r^{-1} = r^3 in D4). r^3 is not in the set. sr*s = r (since sr s = r^{ -1} r = r^{-1}? Wait, maybe I need to be careful with the multiplication rules. In D4, s r = r^{-1} s. So (sr)(s) = r^{-1} s s = r^{-1} e = r^3. So product sr*s = r^3, which is not in the set {s, sr}. So {s, sr} is product-free. Now, can we add another element? Let's try adding sr^2. The set becomes {s, sr, sr^2}. Check products: s*sr^2 = r^{-2} s s = r^2. Not in the set. sr*sr^2 = s r^{-1} sr^2 = s s r r^{-1} r^2 = e r^2 = r^2, not in the set. So no immediate issues. Wait, but need to check all products. s*s = e \u2209 set. sr*sr = s r^{-1} s r = s s r r^{-1} r = e r^2 = r^2 \u2209 set. s*sr = r^3 \u2209 set. etc. So {s, sr, sr^2} may be product-free. Therefore, {s, sr} is not maximal. Hence, D4 does not have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nAlternatively, pick two elements like r and s. Products: r*s = sr^{-1} = sr^3, not in set. s*r = sr, not in set. r*r = r^2, not in set. s*s = e, not in set. So {r, s} is product-free. Can we add sr? Then products: r*sr = s r^{-1} r = s, which is in the set. So adding sr would lead to r*sr = s \u2208 set. Invalid. So {r, s} is maximal? Wait, can we add another element without causing a product? Suppose we add r^2. The set becomes {r, s, r^2}. Check products: r*r^2 = r^3 \u2209 set. r*s = sr^3 \u2209 set. s*r^2 = sr^2 \u2209 set. r^2*r^2 = r^4 = e \u2209 set. So maybe {r, s, r^2} is product-free. If so, then {r, s} is not maximal. It's unclear. Let me check more carefully.\n\nIf we add r^2 to {r, s}, new set {r, s, r^2}:\n\n- r*r = r^2 \u2208 set. So product r*r = r^2, which is in the set. Therefore, adding r^2 would make the set not product-free. Hence, cannot add r^2.\n\nTrying to add sr^2:\n\nSet {r, s, sr^2}. Check products:\n\nr*sr^2 = s r^{-1} r^2 = s r. But s r = sr, which is not in the set.\n\ns*r = sr \u2209 set.\n\ns*sr^2 = r^{-2} s s = r^2 \u2209 set.\n\nsr^2* sr^2 = (sr^2)^2 = e \u2209 set.\n\nr*sr^2 = sr^{-1} r^2 = sr.\n\nSo no products within the set. So {r, s, sr^2} might be product-free. So in that case, the original set {r, s} is not maximal. Therefore, D4 doesn't have such a set.\n\nNow, considering all the groups we've looked at, the ones that do have maximal product-free sets of size 2 are:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 4 (Z_4)\n2. Cyclic group of order 5 (Z_5)\n3. Klein four-group (V4)\n4. Symmetric group S3 (order 6)\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLet's check the cyclic group of order 6, Z_6. In additive terms, sum-free sets. The elements are 0,1,2,3,4,5. A sum-free set of size 2. For example, {1,3} as before. Can we add another element? Like 5. {1,3,5}. 1+3=4 not in set. 1+5=6=0 not in set. 3+5=8=2 not in set. So {1,3,5} is sum-free. Therefore, {1,3} is not maximal. Thus, Z_6 doesn't qualify.\n\nHow about the cyclic group of order 3, Z_3. As we saw earlier, no sum-free sets of size 2. Similarly for order 2, order 1. So no.\n\nCheck the cyclic group of order 7, Z_7. As before, a sum-free set {2,3} can be extended to {2,3,5} or similar, so no.\n\nAnother group: the dihedral group D3 (order 6), which is actually isomorphic to S3. So we've already counted that.\n\nWhat about the quaternion group of order 8? We saw that it doesn't have such a set.\n\nWhat about the cyclic group of order 8, Z_8? Let's check sum-free sets. {1,3} in Z_8. 1+1=2, 1+3=4, 3+3=6. None in the set. Can we add 5? {1,3,5}. 1+5=6, 3+5=8=0, 1+3=4. None in the set. So {1,3,5} is sum-free. Therefore, {1,3} is not maximal. So Z_8 does not have such a set.\n\nAre there any other groups of order up to 8?\n\nThe groups up to order 8 are:\n\nOrder 1: trivial group.\n\nOrder 2: Z_2.\n\nOrder 3: Z_3.\n\nOrder 4: Z_4, V4.\n\nOrder 5: Z_5.\n\nOrder 6: Z_6, S3.\n\nOrder 7: Z_7.\n\nOrder 8: Z_8, Z_4\u00d7Z_2, Z_2\u00d7Z_2\u00d7Z_2, D4, Q8.\n\nWe've checked these. So the only groups with such sets are Z_4, Z_5, V4, and S3.\n\nWait, but wait. The group Z_4 (cyclic of order 4), V4 (Klein four), S3 (symmetric group of order 6), and Z_5 (cyclic of order 5). So four groups.\n\nBut let's confirm with examples.\n\nFor V4: We had the set {a, b}, which is product-free and maximal.\n\nFor Z_4: {1,3} is sum-free and maximal.\n\nFor Z_5: {2,3} is sum-free and maximal.\n\nFor S3: { (12), (123) } is product-free and maximal.\n\nAre there any other groups beyond these four? Let me think about order 7 and above. For example, Z_7 doesn't work. What about non-abelian groups of order 8, like D4 and Q8, which we checked and saw they don't have such sets.\n\nWhat about the group Z_3 \u00d7 Z_3 (order 9). Let's consider sum-free sets here. In additive terms, a sum-free set is a set with no two elements adding to another. Let's see if such a set of size 2 exists. Take two elements like (1,0) and (0,1). Their sum is (1,1), which is not in the set. So the set {(1,0), (0,1)} is sum-free. Is it maximal? Adding (2,2) (assuming elements are ordered pairs). Check if adding (2,2) would create any sums. The set becomes {(1,0), (0,1), (2,2)}. Check sums:\n\n(1,0) + (0,1) = (1,1) \u2209 set.\n\n(1,0) + (2,2) = (0,2) \u2209 set.\n\n(0,1) + (2,2) = (2,0) \u2209 set.\n\nSo maybe this is sum-free. Therefore, the original set wasn't maximal. So Z_3 \u00d7 Z_3 doesn't qualify.\n\nTherefore, up to order 8, only the four groups mentioned earlier have maximal product-free sets of size 2.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for finite groups in general, not just up to a certain order. However, considering that the question requires counting the number of finite groups with this property, and since there are infinitely many finite groups, but the answer is likely a small finite number. Since in cyclic groups of order 4 and 5, and in Klein four-group and S3, we have examples, and larger groups don't seem to have such sets, perhaps the answer is 4.\n\nBut I need to confirm if there are any other groups beyond these four.\n\nWait, let's consider another non-abelian group of order 12, like A4 (alternating group on 4 letters). Let's see if it has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nA4 has elements consisting of even permutations. It has 12 elements: the identity, eight 3-cycles, and three double transpositions (products of two disjoint transpositions).\n\nLet's try to find a product-free set of size 2. Take two 3-cycles, say (123) and (124). Their products: (123)(124) = (12)(34), which is a double transposition. (124)(123) = (13)(24). So neither product is in the set. Also, (123)(123) = (132), and (124)(124) = (142). So squares of elements are other 3-cycles not in the set. So the set {(123), (124)} is product-free. Is it maximal? Let's try adding another element, say (132). Now, check products: (123)*(132) = e (the identity), not in the set. (124)*(132) = (1)(2 4 3) = (243), a 3-cycle not in the set. (132)*(132) = (123), which is in the set. Oh, so (132)^2 = (123), which is in the set. Therefore, adding (132) would result in a product within the set. Hence, cannot add (132). Adding a double transposition, say (12)(34). Check products: (123)*(12)(34) = (1)(3)(2 4), which is (24), a transposition, not in A4. Wait, but (12)(34) multiplied by (123) would be (134). Let me compute correctly:\n\n(123)*(12)(34) = (1)(2 3) * (1 2)(3 4) = ?\n\nWait, permutation multiplication is done right-to-left. So (123) is a cycle sending 1\u21922, 2\u21923, 3\u21921. Then (12)(34) swaps 1\u21942 and 3\u21944.\n\nSo applying (12)(34) first, then (123). Let's calculate:\n\nLet\u2019s compute (123) * (12)(34):\n\nStart with element 1:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34): 1 \u2192 2.\n\nThen apply (123): 2 \u2192 3.\n\nSo overall, 1 \u2192 3.\n\nElement 2:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34): 2 \u2192 1.\n\nThen apply (123): 1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo 2 \u2192 2.\n\nElement 3:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34): 3 \u21924.\n\nThen apply (123): 4 \u21924 (since (123) doesn't affect 4).\n\nSo 3 \u21924.\n\nElement 4:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34): 4 \u21923.\n\nThen apply (123): 3 \u21921.\n\nSo 4 \u21921.\n\nThus, the product is the permutation (1 3 4), a 3-cycle not in the set. Similarly, (12)(34) * (123) would give another permutation. Regardless, the product is not in the set. Therefore, adding (12)(34) to {(123), (124)} gives a set { (123), (124), (12)(34) }, which may still be product-free. Wait, check all products:\n\n(123)*(12)(34) = (1 3 4), not in set.\n\n(124)*(12)(34) = Let's compute:\n\nFirst apply (12)(34) to each element:\n\n1\u21922, 2\u21921, 3\u21924, 4\u21923.\n\nThen apply (124):\n\n1\u21922, 2\u21924, 4\u21921, 3\u21923.\n\nSo overall:\n\nFor element 1:\n\nApply (12)(34): 1\u21922, then (124): 2\u21924. So 1\u21924.\n\nFor element 2:\n\nApply (12)(34): 2\u21921, then (124): 1\u21922. So 2\u21922.\n\nFor element 4:\n\nApply (12)(34): 4\u21923, then (124): 3\u21923. So 4\u21923.\n\nFor element 3:\n\nApply (12)(34): 3\u21924, then (124): 4\u21921. So 3\u21921.\n\nThus, the permutation is (1 4 3), a 3-cycle not in the set. So (124)*(12)(34) = (143) \u2209 set.\n\n products between (12)(34) and others:\n\n(12)(34)*(123) = Let's compute:\n\nFirst apply (123), then (12)(34).\n\nElement 1:\n\nApply (123): 1\u21922, then (12)(34): 2\u21921. So 1\u21921.\n\nElement 2:\n\nApply (123): 2\u21923, then (12)(34): 3\u21924. So 2\u21924.\n\nElement 3:\n\nApply (123): 3\u21921, then (12)(34): 1\u21922. So 3\u21922.\n\nElement 4:\n\nApply (123): 4\u21924, then (12)(34): 4\u21923. So 4\u21923.\n\nThus, the product is (2 4 3), which is (243) a 3-cycle not in the set.\n\nSo all products are not in the set. Therefore, the set { (123), (124), (12)(34) } is product-free. Hence, the original set { (123), (124) } is not maximal. Therefore, A4 does not have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nThis suggests that there are no such groups beyond the four we've identified: Z_4, Z_5, V4, and S3.\n\nTherefore, the number of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 is 4.",
