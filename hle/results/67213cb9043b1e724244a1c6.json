  "question": "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, C7H8, how many contracted Gaussian functions are used",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about the number of contracted Gaussian functions in a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene, C7H8. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that basis sets determine how the atomic orbitals are represented in quantum chemistry calculations. The 6-31G basis set is a common one. Let me recall how it works. For each atom, the basis set specifies the number of contracted Gaussian functions. \n\nSo, for the 6-31G basis set, each hydrogen atom typically uses a certain number of functions, and each carbon uses another. Wait, right. The notation 6-31G means that for each atom, the core orbitals are represented by a single contraction. For carbon, the first part (6) is a 6 primitive Gaussians contracted into one for the inner shell. Then the valence orbitals are split into two parts: 3 primitives contracted into one and 1 primitive (which is not contracted, I think). Wait, maybe the 31 part: the first number after the hyphen is for the valence orbitals. Wait, maybe the 6-31G means that for heavy atoms like carbon, the inner shell is a contraction of 6 primitives, and the valence is split into two shells: the first valence is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the second is a single (1) primitive. But wait, no, maybe for the 6-31G basis, each atom's basis functions are split. Let me think again.\n\nIn the 6-31G basis set, each heavy atom (like carbon) has a double-zeta basis for the valence electrons. The '6' refers to the inner shell (like the 1s orbital for hydrogen, but wait, hydrogen doesn't have an inner shell. Wait, maybe for carbon, the inner shells (1s, 2s, 2p) are described by a single contraction of 6 Gaussian primitives. Then the valence orbitals (2s and 2p for carbon) are split into two parts: the first (3s, 3p) contraction with 3 primitives and the second (1s, 1p) with 1 primitive each. Wait, no. Or maybe the 6-31G is that for the valence orbitals: the first number is the number of primitives in the inner contraction, and the second number (split into two parts) for the valence. I'm a bit confused here. Let me look it up in my mind.\n\nWait, the 6-31G basis set for carbon would have the following: the core orbitals (1s) are described by a single contracted Gaussian composed of 6 primitives. The valence orbitals (2s and 2p) are split into two contractions. The first part (the 3 in 6-31G) is that the valence orbitals are split into two basis functions: the first is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the second is a single primitive (the 1 in 6-31G). So for each valence orbital (like 2s and 2p for carbon), there are two basis functions. But how does that translate into the number of contracted functions?\n\nWait, perhaps each carbon in the 6-31G basis set has a certain number of contracted functions. Let's break it down: For carbon, in 6-31G, the basis set includes:\n\n- Core orbitals (maybe 1s) as a single contraction of 6 primitives. But wait, for carbon, the core would be 1s, but in basis sets, it's more about how the orbitals are split. Wait, maybe the 6-31G for carbon has the following: the inner shell (like K-shell) is a single contraction of 6 primitives. Then, the valence (L-shell) is split into two parts. The first part (for s orbitals) is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the second part (s and p?) is a single primitive. Wait, perhaps for each angular momentum (s, p), the valence is split into two basis functions. So for carbon, 6-31G means:\n\n- For the s orbital: a contraction of 6 primitives (core), and then two valence contractions: 3 and 1 primitives. But wait, no. Wait, maybe the notation is that for each atom, the basis set is split into shells. The first number (6) is the number of primitives in the core (inner shell) contracted into one function. Then the next numbers (3 and 1) refer to the valence orbitals. The 3 is for the first valence contraction (3 primitives contracted into one) and the 1 is for the second valence contraction (1 primitive, which isn't contracted, so just a single function). So for each valence orbital type (s and p), you have two contractions: 3 and 1. Wait, but how does that translate into the number of contracted functions?\n\nAlternatively, for each carbon atom in 6-31G, the basis set consists of the following contracted functions:\n\n- The core (1s) is a single contracted Gaussian (6 primitives).\n- The valence (2s, 2p) is split into two contracted functions. For the s orbital: a contraction of 3 primitives and another contraction of 1 primitive. For the p orbitals: same? So for each carbon, the total contracted functions would be:\n\n1 (core s) + 2 (valence s) + 2 (valence p) * 3 (since p has three orbitals: x, y, z). Wait, no. Let me think again. Each p orbital (l=1) has three components (px, py, pz), each of which would have the same basis functions. So for the valence p orbitals, each contraction would apply to all three components. So if the valence p orbitals are split into two contractions (3 primitives and 1 primitive), then each p component (x, y, z) would have two basis functions. So for each p orbital, there are two contracted functions per component, but multiplied by 3 components. \n\nWait, but maybe the basis functions for carbon are as follows. The core (1s) is a single contraction. Then, for the valence 2s and 2p orbitals: each has two contractions. So the 2s orbital is represented by two contracted functions (the 3 and 1), and each 2p orbital (px, py, pz) is represented by two contracted functions each. So total contracted functions per carbon would be:\n\nCore: 1 (s-type)\nValence s: 2 (from 3 and 1 primitives)\nValence p: 2 (contractions) * 3 (p orbitals) = 6\n\nSo total per carbon: 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check another approach. For the 6-31G basis set, the number of contracted functions per atom is determined as follows. For carbon:\n\n- The core (1s) is one contracted function (6 primitives).\n- The valence s orbital is split into two contractions: 3 and 1 primitives, so 2 contracted functions for s.\n- The valence p orbitals (each px, py, pz) are split into two contractions each. So each p orbital has 2 functions, multiplied by 3 for px, py, pz \u2192 2*3=6.\n\nTotal for carbon: 1 (core) + 2 (s valence) + 6 (p valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n\nHydrogen, on the other hand, in 6-31G would have a basis set where each H has:\n\n- The 1s orbital is split into two contractions. The 3-1 part? Wait, maybe for hydrogen, 6-31G is different. Wait, H's basis in 6-31G is typically two functions: a contraction of 3 primitives and a single (1) primitive. Wait, but 6-31G notation applies to H too. Wait, H's basis in 6-31G is that the valence is split into two: 3 and 1. Wait, but hydrogen only has 1s. So for each H, the 6-31G basis would have two contracted s functions. Wait, but wait, the first number in 6-31G is for the core, but hydrogen doesn't have a core. Maybe for H, the 6-31G is structured as 2 functions: the first is a contraction of 3 primitives (maybe that's where the 3 comes from), and the second is 1 primitive. Wait, but some sources say that for H in 6-31G, the basis is 2 contracted functions: 3 primitives contracted to one and 1 primitive (so 2 functions). So each hydrogen contributes 2 contracted functions.\n\nSo for toluene, which is C7H8, we need to calculate the total contracted functions.\n\nEach carbon contributes 9 functions, each hydrogen 2.\n\nSo total contracted functions = 7*9 + 8*2 = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\nWait, but let me verify. I'm a bit shaky on this. Let me check another way. For example, the 6-31G basis set for carbon: the contraction scheme is 6 (core s) \u2192 1 function. Valence s and p: split into two each. For valence s: 3 primitives \u2192 1 function and 1 primitive \u21921 function. So s valence has 2 functions. For p valence: same? Each p orbital (x, y, z) has two functions. So for p, 3 (orbitals) * 2 (functions each) = 6. So total for carbon: 1 (core s) + 2 (valence s) +6 (valence p) =9. That seems right.\n\nHydrogen: 3 primitives contracted to 1 and 1 primitive (so two functions). So each H has 2. So yes, 2 per H.\n\nSo 7 carbons: 7 *9=63. 8 hydrogens:8*2=16. Total 63+16=79. So the answer is 79 contracted Gaussian functions. Therefore, the correct answer should be 79.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The 6-31G basis set assigns contracted Gaussian functions based on atomic orbitals. For carbon (C), the core (1s) uses 1 contraction (6 primitives). Valence orbitals split into two: 2s (3 primitives \u2192 1 contraction) and 2p (split into 3 primitives and 1 primitive, yielding 2 contractions per p orbital). Carbon has 2 valence s-contractions and 6 p-contractions (2 per px, py, pz), totaling 1 (core) + 2 (s) + 6 (p) = 9 functions. Hydrogen (H) uses two contractions (3+1 primitives for 1s). Toluene (C\u2087H\u2088) has 7 C atoms (7\u00d79=63) and 8 H atoms (8\u00d72=16), resulting in 63+16=79 contracted functions.\n\nAnswer: 79  \nConfidence: 95%",
