  "question": "Which is the first book in the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, and which play is it mentioned in?\n",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which book of the Bible is first mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play and which play that is. Let's start by recalling that Shakespeare often referenced biblical themes and stories, even though the Bible wasn't directly quoted as much because of the time period and the different versions available.\n\nFirst, I should think about the books of the Bible and their commonality. The more well-known ones like Genesis, Psalms, Proverbs, maybe the Gospels. Which of these might Shakespeare have referenced by name?\n\nNow, which plays might include direct mentions. The Merchant of Venice comes to mind because Shylock is a Jewish character, so maybe references to the Old Testament. But does he mention a specific book? Wait, in Act 1 Scene 3, Shylock references a story from the Bible. Let me think\u2014Shylock talks about Jacob and Laban, which is from Genesis. But does he actually say \"Genesis\" by name?\n\nWait, what's the exact quote? Shylock says, \"When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban\u2019s sheep\u2014This Jacob from our holy Abram was...\" and then he goes into the story. But that's paraphrasing the story from Genesis 30. However, does he mention the actual book's name? I'm not sure. Maybe not. So maybe that's not the instance.\n\nAnother play? Let's think about Henry IV or Henry V. Falstaff is a character who might make biblical references, but again, would he name a specific book? Maybe in one of the history plays. \n\nWait, in Henry IV Part 1, Falstaff is comedic. Then there's the play Titus Andronicus. But that's a tragedy. What about other comedies? Maybe As You Like It or Twelfth Night.\n\nWait, in the play \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" there's a scene where they might mention a book. Alternatively, maybe in one of the tragedies. Let me think of the exact mentions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Book of Numbers. But I'm not sure. Wait, in the play \"Henry V,\" there's a reference to the Book of Numbers. Let me recall. In Act 1 Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury is talking about the law of succession, and he refers to the Book of Numbers. The exact line is something like: \"In the book of Numbers is it writ, when the son dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.\" That's a direct mention of Numbers. But is that the earliest play where a book is named?\n\nWait, but when were the plays written? Let's get the order right. Henry V was written around 1599, while The Merchant of Venice around 1596-1598. If the Merchant of Venice's mention doesn't name the book, but Henry V does, then Henry V would be the first. But maybe another play earlier?\n\nAlternatively, in \"Henry VI\" parts. Let's see. Henry VI Part 1 was written earlier, maybe 1590s. But does it mention a book by name?\n\nAlternatively, in \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" which is a comedy with a lot of wordplay. There's a character named Holofernes who is a pedant. He might quote various texts. In Act 4 Scene 2, Holofernes refers to the Book of Jeremiah. The line is: \"He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it. [...] Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while. Dull: Nor understood none neither, by your leave. Holo. [...] O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. And via, again! [...] This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it. [...] The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, congruent, and measurable for the afternoon: the word is well cull'd, chose, sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure: [...] Sir, I praise the Lord for you: and so may my parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by you, and their daughters profit very greatly under you: you are a good member of the commonwealth. [...] For the doughty Sir Holofernes, as the Scythian said to his thirsty steed, 'Welcome to the sweat of your bed!' Indeed, the epilogue is nothing in the world but 'Let the end try the man.' But, indeed, Master Person, quasi pers-on. And if one should be pierced, which is the one? [...] But, sir, I assure you, it was a buck of the first head. [...] I do fear colourable colours. But to return to the verses: did they please you, Sir Nathaniel? [...] Here are only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret. Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso, but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention? [...] And such barren plants are set before us, that we thankful should be, which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that do fructify in us more than he.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to figure out which book of the Bible is first mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play and which play that is. Let's start by recalling that Shakespeare often referenced biblical themes and stories, even though the Bible wasn't directly quoted as much because of the time period and the different versions available.\n\nFirst, I should think about the books of the Bible and their commonality. The more well-known ones like Genesis, Psalms, Proverbs, maybe the Gospels. Which of these might Shakespeare have referenced by name?\n\nNow, which plays might include direct mentions. The Merchant of Venice comes to mind because Shylock is a Jewish character, so maybe references to the Old Testament. But does he mention a specific book? Wait, in Act 1 Scene 3, Shylock references a story from the Bible. Let me think\u2014Shylock talks about Jacob and Laban, which is from Genesis. But does he actually say \"Genesis\" by name?\n\nWait, what's the exact quote? Shylock says, \"When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban\u2019s sheep\u2014This Jacob from our holy Abram was...\" and then he goes into the story. But that's paraphrasing the story from Genesis 30. However, does he mention the actual book's name? I'm not sure. Maybe not. So maybe that's not the instance.\n\nAnother play? Let's think about Henry IV or Henry V. Falstaff is a character who might make biblical references, but again, would he name a specific book? Maybe in one of the history plays. \n\nWait, in Henry IV Part 1, Falstaff is comedic. Then there's the play Titus Andronicus. But that's a tragedy. What about other comedies? Maybe As You Like It or Twelfth Night.\n\nWait, in the play \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" there's a scene where they might mention a book. Alternatively, maybe in one of the tragedies. Let me think of the exact mentions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Book of Numbers. But I'm not sure. Wait, in the play \"Henry V,\" there's a reference to the Book of Numbers. Let me recall. In Act 1 Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury is talking about the law of succession, and he refers to the Book of Numbers. The exact line is something like: \"In the book of Numbers is it writ, when the son dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.\" That's a direct mention of Numbers. But is that the earliest play where a book is named?\n\nWait, but when were the plays written? Let's get the order right. Henry V was written around 1599, while The Merchant of Venice around 1596-1598. If the Merchant of Venice's mention doesn't name the book, but Henry V does, then Henry V would be the first. But maybe another play earlier?\n\nAlternatively, in \"Henry VI\" parts. Let's see. Henry VI Part 1 was written earlier, maybe 1590s. But does it mention a book by name?\n\nAlternatively, in \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" which is a comedy with a lot of wordplay. There's a character named Holofernes who is a pedant. He might quote various texts. In Act 4 Scene 2, Holofernes refers to the Book of Jeremiah. The line is: \"He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it. [...] Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while. Dull: Nor understood none neither, by your leave. Holo. [...] O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. And via, again! [...] This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it. [...] The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, congruent, and measurable for the afternoon: the word is well cull'd, chose, sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure: [...] Sir, I praise the Lord for you: and so may my parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by you, and their daughters profit very greatly under you: you are a good member of the commonwealth. [...] For the doughty Sir Holofernes, as the Scythian said to his thirsty steed, 'Welcome to the sweat of your bed!' Indeed, the epilogue is nothing in the world but 'Let the end try the man.' But, indeed, Master Person, quasi pers-on. And if one should be pierced, which is the one? [...] But, sir, I assure you, it was a buck of the first head. [...] I do fear colourable colours. But to return to the verses: did they please you, Sir Nathaniel? [...] Here are only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret. Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso, but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention?
