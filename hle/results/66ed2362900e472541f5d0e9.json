  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem says that for a given permutation p of length n, we need to find the maximum possible number of \"good\" indices after exactly one swap. A good index i is one where all elements before i are smaller than p_i and all elements after are larger than p_i. \n\nSo first, I need to understand what makes an index good. Let's break it down. For index i to be good, two conditions must hold:\n1. All elements before i (y < i) must be less than p_i. So p_i must be greater than the maximum of the first i-1 elements.\n2. All elements after i (y > i) must be greater than p_i. So p_i must be less than the minimum of the elements from i+1 to n.\n\nWait, yes. So for each position i, the maximum of the prefix up to i-1 (let's call it left_max[i]) must be less than p_i, and the minimum of the suffix starting at i+1 (right_min[i]) must be greater than p_i. If both conditions are true, then i is a good index.\n\nThe initial step is to compute, for each position i, the left_max and right_min arrays. Then, we can find the current number of good indices.\n\nNow, the challenge is to determine how swapping two elements can maximize the number of good indices. We can perform exactly one swap. So the approach would be to consider all possible pairs (i, j) and compute how the swap affects the good indices. However, checking all pairs is O(n\u00b2), which is not feasible for n up to 2e5. So we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find which swap would give the maximum increase in good indices. Let's think about how a swap affects the left_max and right_min arrays. Changing two elements can affect the left_max and right_min of various positions, not just i and j. For example, if we swap elements at positions i and j (i < j), then any position between i and j could be affected. This seems complicated because a single swap can alter multiple left_max and right_min values.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter approach. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's compute the initial good indices. Let's precompute left_max and right_min arrays. Then, the initial count is the sum over i where left_max[i] < p_i and right_min[i] > p_i.\n\nNow, when we swap elements at positions i and j (i < j, say), the elements p_i and p_j are exchanged. Let's denote the new array as p'. So p'[i] = p_j and p'[j] = p_i. For other positions, the elements remain the same.\n\nThe swap can affect the left_max and right_min arrays. The left_max array is computed from left to right. So if i < j, swapping them can affect the left_max for positions from i to j. Similarly, the right_min array is computed from right to left, so swapping i and j (assuming i < j) might affect the right_min for positions from j downto i.\n\nBut recomputing all left_max and right_min after each possible swap is too time-consuming. So we need a way to calculate the potential new number of good indices for each possible swap in O(1) time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where a swap between a certain pair of elements can create new good indices that weren't there before. For example, swapping a large element from the right with a small element from the left could create a new maximum in the left part or a new minimum in the right part.\n\nWait. Let's consider that when we swap p_i and p_j (i < j), then:\n\nFor position i: in the new array, p'[i] = p_j. The left_max[i] would be the max of the first i-1 elements (which are unchanged if i's element was swapped). Wait, no: the left_max up to i-1 is the same as before, since those elements weren't swapped. So the left_max for i in the new array would be max(left_max[i-1], p_j). Similarly, the right_min for i would be the same as before, except that the suffix after i now has swapped elements.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's see. Suppose we swap i and j. For any position k < i, the left_max is unchanged. For k >= i, the left_max could change if in the original array, the max up to k was either p_i or p_j, but after swapping, it's different.\n\nSimilarly, for right_min: any position k > j would have the same right_min. For positions between i and j, the right_min could change if the original min in the suffix up to k was p_i or p_j.\n\nBut recomputing entire left_max and right_min arrays for each possible swap is not feasible. So maybe we need to find a way to find pairs where swapping them can create two new good indices (i and j), and perhaps not disrupt existing ones. Alternatively, perhaps swapping elements that are the maximum possible in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, think about possible candidates for swapping. For a swap to be useful, perhaps we can swap an element from the left that is not a good index with an element from the right that is not a good index, but after swapping, both positions become good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal swap is to swap the maximum element to the first position, but that might not always be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal answer can be found by considering two elements a and b in the permutation such that when swapped, they create as many new good indices as possible, while not breaking existing ones (or possibly breaking some, but net gain is higher).\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible f(p) after swap is the initial count plus some gain from swapping. The best possible gain is adding two new good indices (i and j), but that's possible only under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible f(p) after swap is n-1. For example, if the permutation is sorted except for two elements, then swapping them would make all elements except maybe one good. But n-1 is possible? Let's see.\n\nIn a sorted array in increasing order, every element is a good index. Because for any i, all elements before are smaller (since sorted), and all elements after are larger. So the initial f(p) is n. So any swap would reduce it. But in that case, the maximum is n. But if the array is almost sorted except for two elements, perhaps swapping two elements can give n-1. However, the problem says that we have to perform exactly one swap. So even if the array is already sorted, we have to swap two elements, which would reduce the count to n-2. So the maximum possible f(p) after swap is not n, but perhaps n-1 in certain cases.\n\nBut how to approach this algorithmically.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible pair (i, j), compute how the swap affects the count of good indices. The problem is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut checking all pairs is O(n\u00b2), which is too slow. So we need to find a way to find the best possible swap in O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal swap is one of a few specific possibilities. For example:\n\n1. Swap the first occurrence where a left element is smaller than a right element.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the maximum possible gain. The initial count is some C. The best swap would add some D good indices and subtract some E bad, so the net gain is D-E. We need to find the maximum possible D-E.\n\nBut how to compute D and E for each possible swap.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible swap (i, j), compute the new number of good indices. The difficulty is how to compute this quickly.\n\nLet's think: when we swap i and j, the new elements at positions i and j are p_j and p_i. The rest of the array is the same. So, to compute the new good indices after swap, we need to check for each position whether it's good in the new array.\n\nBut checking all positions after a swap is O(n), but for each possible swap, this would be O(n\u00b2) time. Not feasible.\n\nThus, we need to find a way to model the effect of the swap on the good indices in O(1) or O(1) per candidate pair.\n\nHmm. Let's think:\n\nThe original good indices are those that meet the conditions based on the original left_max and right_min. When we swap i and j, the left_max and right_min arrays may change for some positions. However, recomputing the entire left_max and right_min after a swap is O(n), which again is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: the swap affects the left_max and right_min arrays only for positions between min(i,j) and max(i,j). So perhaps, for a swap between i and j (i < j), the left_max array from 1 to i-1 is the same. Starting from i, since the element at i is now p_j, the left_max for i would be max(left_max[i-1], p_j). Then for position i+1, left_max becomes max(left_max_new[i], new_p[i+1]), but new_p[i+1] is same as original except if j is i+1.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let's think for a swap between positions i and j where i < j:\n\nAfter the swap:\n\n- The elements from 1 to i-1 are same as before. So left_max for positions 1 to i-1 is same as original.\n\nAt position i: p'[i] = p_j. The left_max_new[i] is max(original left_max[i-1], p_j).\n\nFor positions i+1 to j: the left_max_new[k] depends on the previous left_max_new[k-1] and p[k] in the new array. But the new array's elements from i+1 to j-1 are same as before, except if j is among them. Wait, j is larger than i. So positions i+1 to j-1 are same as original. Only positions i and j are swapped.\n\nSo, for example, if we swap positions i and j (i < j), then the left_max array after i can be different up to j. Because when you compute left_max from left to right, after the swap, the left_max for i is the max of left_max[i-1] (unchanged) and the new element at i (p_j). Then, for position i+1, the left_max would be max(left_max_new[i], p[i+1]) (since p[i+1] is same as before). Unless j is i+1, in which case p[j] is now p_i. \n\nThis seems too complicated for a general case. So perhaps, for each possible swap candidate, we can only check the positions i and j, and their nearby positions, but that might not capture all the changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal swap would be where after swapping, one of the swapped elements creates a new good index, perhaps both i and j become good, and/or some other positions.\n\nBut how to find such a pair.\n\nAnother angle: For each position i, check what element would make i a good index if it was placed there. Then find if there exists such an element in the array which can be swapped with the current element at i. But this is vague.\n\nWait, let's suppose that position i needs to have a value x such that x is greater than the maximum of the prefix up to i-1, and less than the minimum of the suffix from i+1. Let the maximum of the prefix up to i-1 be L[i], and the minimum of the suffix from i+1 be R[i]. Then, the required x for i to be good is x must satisfy L[i] < x < R[i]. Moreover, x must be present in the array, but not at position i. So if there exists a position j such that p[j] is in (L[i], R[i]), then swapping i and j would make i a good index. But also, swapping could affect j's status.\n\nBut this seems possible. For example, for each i, check if there is any element in the array that is in (L[i], R[i]). Then swapping that element with i's current element would make i a good index. Then, perhaps the maximum gain would be 2 if both i and j (after swap) become good, but not sure.\n\nBut this approach requires for each i, checking if such elements exist. However, for each i, the (L[i], R[i]) is a range, and we need to see if any element in the array (outside of i) is in that range. Then, swapping i with such an element's position would make i good. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, let's precompute for each position i, the L[i] and R[i]. Then, for each element x in the array, if x is in the range (L[i], R[i]), then swapping x (which is at position j) with position i could possibly make i a good index.\n\nBut also, after swapping, the element at j (which was p_i) may or may not be a good index. So for each possible candidate pair (i, j), the gain is the sum of:\n\n- whether i becomes good (if p_j is in (L[i], R[i]))\n- whether j becomes good (if p_i is in (L'[j], R'[j}), but L' and R' would change after swapping)\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to consider two scenarios:\n\n1. Find two positions i and j such that swapping them adds two new good indices (i and j). Then the maximum possible gain is +2.\n\n2. Find a position i where swapping with j adds one new good index, and j may lose or gain.\n\nBut how to find these scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible f(p) after the swap is the initial count plus 2. So we need to check if there exists a swap that adds two good indices. If yes, then the answer is initial + 2. Else, check for swaps that add 1, etc.\n\nLet me think of some examples.\n\nExample 1: Original permutation is [2,1], n=2.\n\nThe initial good indices: for i=1, check left (nothing) and right (1). So left_max[1] is undefined (0?), and right_min[1] is 1. So p_1=2 must be less than right_min[1] (1). 2 <1 is false. So i=1 is not good. For i=2, left_max[2] is 2 (max of [2,1] up to index 2-1=1 is 2), and right_min[2] is undefined (n+1). So p_2=1 must be greater than left_max (2). 1>2 is false. So initial count is 0.\n\nAfter swapping, the permutation becomes [1,2]. Both indices are good. So initial count was 0, after swap it's 2. So gain is +2.\n\nSo here, the optimal is adding two good indices. So in this case, the maximum possible is 2.\n\nAnother example: [3,1,2]. Initial good indices: i=1. Let's see:\n\nFor i=1: left is empty. Right elements (1,2) must all be >3. But 1 and 2 are less than 3, so no. So i=1 is not good. For i=2: left elements [3], which must be <1? No. So i=2 not good. For i=3: left elements [3,1], which max is 3. So 2 must be >3. No. So initial count is 0.\n\nIf we swap elements 1 and 3: the permutation becomes [3,2,1]. Which probably has no good indices.\n\nAlternatively, swap 3 and 2: [2,1,3]. For i=1, right elements are [1,3]. All must be >2. 1 is not. So not good. For i=3: left elements are [2,1], max 2 <3, so yes. So i=3 is good. So count is 1. So gain is +1.\n\nAlternatively, swap 1 and 2: [3,2,1]. Again, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, swap 3 and 1: [1,3,2]. Check i=1: right elements [3,2] must be >1. Yes. So i=1 is good. i=2: left max is 3. p_i=3. 3 >=3? Wait, left_max[i] is the maximum of the first i-1 elements. For i=2, left_max[2] is 1 (max of first 1 elements). So 3>1, and right_min[2] is 2. 3 <2? No. So i=2 is not good. i=3: left max is 3 (max of first 2 elements [1,3] is 3). p_i=2 <3? No. So i=3 is not good. So count is 1. So gain is +1.\n\nSo in this example, the maximum gain is 1.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pair that gives gain of 2.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,2,4]. Initial good indices:\n\ni=1: left is empty, right elements must be >1. Yes. So good. i=1 is good.\n\ni=2: left elements [1], max is 1. p_i=3>1. Right elements [2,4], min is 2. 3 <2? No. So i=2 is not good.\n\ni=3: left elements [1,3], max is 3. p_i=2 <3. So not good.\n\ni=4: left elements [1,3,2], max is 3. p_i=4>3. Right is empty. So good. So initial count is 2.\n\nIf we swap elements 3 and 2: [1,2,3,4]. All indices are good. So count is 4. So gain is +2. So here, swapping 3 and 2 gives a gain of +2.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is 4.\n\nSo swapping elements that are in the wrong order, correcting it, could increase the count.\n\nSo the problem is to find such pairs where swapping them turns two positions into good indices, or perhaps more.\n\nBut how to find this without checking all possible pairs.\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each element x in the array, the positions where it can be placed to create a new good index. Then, for each possible x and position j, see if there's a way to swap x with its current position and j such that both positions become good.\n\nBut again, this is a vague plan.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i, the current value p_i can potentially be swapped with a value that is larger than L[i] and smaller than R[i]. If such a value exists in the array, then swapping i with that position j would make i a good index. But j's value (p_i) would need to satisfy its own L[j] and R[j] criteria.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal swap is when after swap, two new good indices are created. For that to happen, the swapped elements must each fit into their new positions' L and R ranges.\n\nSo for positions i and j, after swapping, p_i (now at j) must be larger than L[j] and smaller than R[j], and p_j (now at i) must be larger than L[i] and smaller than R[i].\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\np_j > L[i] and p_j < R[i]\n\np_i > L[j] and p_i < R[j]\n\nIf both these conditions are met, then swapping i and j would make both positions i and j good, provided that the left_max and right_min arrays are not affected in other positions. However, this might not be the case. For example, swapping i and j may affect the left_max for positions between i and j (if i < j), which could turn other positions into bad ones. So even if the two positions i and j become good, other positions may become bad.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps considering these two conditions is a way to find a possible maximum gain, and the actual answer would involve checking all such pairs where swapping i and j gives both i and j as good.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut checking all pairs for these two conditions is O(n\u00b2), which is not feasible. So perhaps we need to find a way to find such pairs in O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, precompute for each position i, the pairs (i, j) where j is a position such that p_j is in (L[i], R[i}), and p_i is in (L[j], R[j}).\n\nBut even this seems O(n\u00b2) in the worst case.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the possible candidates.\n\nFor a pair (i, j) to be a candidate where swapping gives both i and j as good, the following must hold:\n\np_j must be > L[i] and < R[i], and p_i must be > L[j] and < R[j].\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nAlternatively, for each element x in the array, let's note all positions i where x could be placed to make i a good index. Then, for x and y, if x is placed in i, and y is placed in j, and x and y are in each other's possible positions, then swapping could create two good indices.\n\nBut this is too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum gain is 2, but only if such a pair exists. If not, then the maximum gain is 1 or 0.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. Compute the initial count of good indices.\n\n2. Check if there exists a pair (i, j) where swapping them adds 2 good indices. If yes, return initial + 2.\n\n3. Else, check if there exists a pair that adds 1 good index.\n\n4. The answer is the maximum of initial, initial + 1, or initial + 2.\n\nBut how to implement steps 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible is initial + 2, initial +1, or initial.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding if there's a pair that gives two new good indices, otherwise check for one.\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nLet's think again about the example where the array becomes sorted after swap. For instance, in the example [3,1,2,4], swapping 3 and 1 gives [1,3,2,4]. Then i=1 is good, i=4 is still good, but the sorted array has all good indices. So when the array is not sorted, but can be sorted with one swap, then the answer would be n, but in the problem statement, the initial array is a permutation. However, after swapping, if the array is sorted, then every position i is good. So the maximum possible is n. But the problem requires exactly one swap. So if the array is already sorted, we have to swap two elements, which would reduce the count to n-2.\n\nBut if the array can be sorted with one swap, then the answer is n. For example, the array [1,3,2,4], which can be sorted by swapping 3 and 2, leading to all indices being good. So in this case, the swap between 2 and 3 (positions 2 and 3) gives 4 good indices.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible is either the initial count, initial + 1, or initial + 2. But how to find when it's possible to get a swap that gives more.\n\nBut how to check for pairs that when swapped would create two new good indices.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, find all j where p_j is in (L[i], R[i}) and p_i is in (L[j], R[j}).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i, compute the possible value that can be placed here to make it good. That value x must be in (L[i], R[i]).\n\nThen, for each value x in (L[i], R[i}), find the position j where p_j = x, and check whether placing x in i and p_i in j would make j a good index. That is, p_i should be in (L[j], R[j}).\n\nBut this requires for each i, to iterate over all possible x in (L[i], R[i}) and check if x's original position j has L[j] < p_i < R[j}.\n\nThis could be done by precomputing a map from values to their positions. Then for each i, for x in (L[i}, R[i}), find j = position[x], and check if p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nIf such a pair exists, then swapping i and j would make both i and j good.\n\nThis approach would require, for each i, to iterate through all values x in (L[i}, R[i}) and check their j's L and R. However, the ranges (L[i}, R[i}) could be large, but in practice, for permutations, each x is unique. The number of x in (L[i}, R[i}) is (R[i} - L[i} -1) possible values, but R[i} can be up to n+1, so this approach is O(n) per i, which is O(n\u00b2), which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to find such pairs quickly.\n\nAlternatively, let's precompute for each value x, the positions j where x is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nThen, for each i, if there exists a j where p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}), then swapping i and j could create two good indices. But this would require checking for each i whether there's such a j.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, create a hash map where for each value x, store all positions j where x is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nThen, for each i, check if there is a j in the map for x = p_i, such that p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the desired x for position i is in (L[i}, R[i}). So the positions j where p_j is x in (L[i}, R[i}) can be found by looking at the values in that interval.\n\nBut given that the permutation consists of distinct elements, we can precompute for each value x, its position in the array (since it's a permutation, each x is present once). Then, for each i, the set of possible j is the set of positions where p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nSo for each i, iterate over all x in (L[i}+1, R[i}-1), and check if x exists (which it does) and find j = pos[x]. Then, check if p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut this is O(n) per i, which is again O(n\u00b2) time.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is not feasible. So this approach is not suitable.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative plan: The optimal swap is to swap two elements such that in the new array, both elements are at positions where their values are in the correct range. Let's assume that swapping i and j would make both i and j good. Then, the conditions are:\n\nFor i:\n\nnew_p[i] = p_j should be in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nFor j:\n\nnew_p[j] = p_i should be in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nAdditionally, other positions may be affected. But assuming that other positions are not affected (which is not necessarily true), then this swap would give a gain of 2. However, the other positions could lose their good status, but perhaps this is the best possible scenario.\n\nBut how to find such pairs (i, j) efficiently.\n\nLet's precompute for each position i, the possible x that can be placed in i to make it a good index. x must be in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nNow, for the elements in [L[i}+1, R[i}-1], their positions are known.\n\nFor each such x in this range, let j be the position of x. Now, check if p_i (original) is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nIf yes, then swapping i and j would make both i and j good indices.\n\nSo, for each i, we need to look up all x in the range (L[i}, R[i}) and check if their corresponding j's have p_i in the range (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut checking all x in the range for each i is O(n\u00b2) time in the worst case (if for every i, the range (L[i}, R[i}) is O(n)).\n\nThus, we need a way to find for each i, whether there exists any x in (L[i}, R[i}) such that p_i is in (L[j}, R[j} ), where j is the position of x.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother idea: For each value x in the array, precompute the ranges (L[j}, R[j}) for their position j. Then, for each i, check if there exists a j where x = p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nThis can be done by for each j, store the (L[j}, R[j}) intervals. Then, for each i, iterate over all x in (L[i}, R[i}) and check if p_i is in the interval (L[j}, R[j}), where j is the position of x.\n\nBut again, this is O(n) per i.\n\nAlternative plan: \n\nThe maximum possible gain is 2. So we can first check if there exists any pair (i, j) such that swapping them results in both i and j becoming good. If such a pair exists, then the answer is initial count + 2. If not, check for pairs that result in a gain of 1.\n\nBut how to check for pairs (i, j) that satisfy the two conditions:\n\np_j is in (L[i}, R[i}) \n\np_i is in (L[j}, R[j} )\n\nBut checking for this in O(n) time.\n\nPerhaps, precompute for each value x the positions j where x is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nThen, for each i, check if there's a j in the set of positions where x = p_i is in (L[j}, R[j} ), and p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can compute the range (L[i}, R[i}) and see if there's any j in the array where p_j is in that range and p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut again, checking for each i is O(n) time.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the L and R arrays. \n\nCompute L as the prefix maxima. For each i, L[i] is the maximum of p[1..i-1].\n\nCompute R as the suffix minima. For each i, R[i] is the minimum of p[i+1..n].\n\nSo for each position i, the required value for a good index is in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nNow, for the array, the permutation has values from 1 to n.\n\nSo for each i, the range (L[i}, R[i}) is a interval. For example, if L[i} is 3 and R[i} is 5, then the required value is 4.\n\nBut in the permutation, the value 4 is at some position j.\n\nThus, for each i, if there's a j such that p[j] is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p[i] is in (L[j}, R[j} ), then swapping i and j would make both i and j good.\n\nBut how to find such a pair (i,j) in O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, check if p[i] is in the range (L[j}, R[j} ), where j is the position of a value in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nBut to find this quickly, perhaps create a hash map or array that maps each value to its position. Then for each i, iterate over all possible values in the range (L[i}, R[i}) and check if p[i] is in the range of their corresponding positions.\n\nBut this is O(n^2) in worst case.\n\nBut considering that the permutation contains unique values, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible pair (i, j), the only way swapping them can add two good indices is if p[j] is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p[i] is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nSo for each i, can we find a j where p[j] is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p[i] is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nIf we can find such a j for any i, then swapping i and j gives a gain of 2.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding such a pair.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nHere's an approach:\n\n1. Precompute L and R arrays.\n\n2. Create a dictionary value_pos that maps each value to its position.\n\n3. For each i in 1..n:\n\n   a. Check the range (L[i], R[i}).\n\n   b. For each value x in (L[i], R[i} ), check if x exists in the array. Since it's a permutation, x exists exactly once.\n\n   c. Get j = value_pos[x].\n\n   d. Check if p[i] is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nIf yes, then swapping i and j gives both good indices.\n\nBut how to find x in (L[i}, R[i} ) efficiently.\n\nThe problem is that for each i, the range (L[i}, R[i} ) can be large, and iterating through all x in this range is O(n) per i.\n\nHowever, it's possible that in some cases, the range is empty. For example, if L[i} >= R[i}, then there are no x in the range. So for such i, there's no possible x to swap with.\n\nBut for permutations, L[i} and R[i} are such that L[i} < R[i} in some cases.\n\nFor example, if i is a good index, then L[i} < p[i} < R[i}, but [x for x in (L[i}, R[i} )] would include p[i}, but since x must be swapped, we're looking for other values.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\nLet's think of a way to find pairs (i, j) where:\n\n- p[j] > L[i} and p[j} < R[i}\n\n- p[i} > L[j} and p[i} < R[j}\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother idea is to precompute for each position j, the set of possible i such that p[j} is in (L[i}, R[i} ), and p[i} is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a swap to create two new good indices, the two elements must fit into each other's intervals.\n\nSo, the elements p[i} and p[j} must satisfy p[j} is in the interval of i, and p[i} is in the interval of j.\n\nSo, to find such pairs, we can iterate through all possible pairs i < j, check if the two conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut this is O(n\u00b2), which is not feasible.\n\nHence, we need to find a way to find such pairs quickly.\n\nAnother idea: For each j, compute the interval (L[j}, R[j} ). Then, for each j, if there's an i where p[i} is in (L[j}, R[j} ), and p[j} is in (L[i}, R[i} ), then swapping i and j would create two good indices.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to find such pairs.\n\nPerhaps, for each j, we can look for i's where p[j} is in (L[i}, R[i} ) and p[i} is in (L[j}, R[j} ).\n\nBut again, this is O(n\u00b2) time.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe maximum possible f(p) after swap is either:\n\n- The current count plus 2 (if such a swap exists),\n\n- Current count plus 1,\n\n- or the current count.\n\nSo, the algorithm should compute these possibilities.\n\nBut how to compute them.\n\nAnother observation: when you swap two elements, you can affect at most O(1) new good indices. Because the swap affects the left_max and right_min arrays, which can change for a range of positions. But this can lead to multiple good indices being added or removed. Hence, the maximum gain may be more than 2.\n\nBut in practice, it's difficult to find such cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best candidate pairs are those where i and j are in certain positions, such as the first and last positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i, check if swapping it with the position where the maximum in the entire array is located can yield a gain.\n\nAlternatively, consider swapping the global maximum to the first position, but this would only affect the good indices for the first position.\n\nAlternatively, swap the smallest element to the end.\n\nBut this is not systematic.\n\nWait, the first position's good condition requires that all elements after are larger than p[1]. So if we swap p[1] with a smaller element, then p[1] would have a higher chance of being good. For example, if we make p[1] the smallest element, then all elements after would be larger, making i=1 a good index.\n\nBut after swapping, the element that was swapped into position 1 (previously at position j) may also become good if its new position j's conditions are met.\n\nBut how to find such j.\n\nAlternatively, to make i=1 good after swapping, the new element at i=1 should be smaller than the original R[1} (the minimum of the suffix starting at 2). So if we swap i=1 with j where p[j} < R[1}, then i=1 becomes good.\n\nBut also, the element p[1} is now at j. For j to be good, p[1} must be greater than the maximum of the elements before j in the original array (since after swapping, the elements before j are unchanged except for position 1 if j>1. So if j is 3, the elements before j in the original array are the same as before except position 1's original value is now at j.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the best approach is to look for an answer pattern. For example, the maximum possible f(p) after swap is either the current count plus 2, or the current count plus 1, or the current count. So, the optimal answer is computed by checking all possible pairs that could give +2, +1, or select the best.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAfter trying various ideas and still not finding a way to compute this efficiently, perhaps the solution involves the following steps:\n\n1. Precompute left_max and right_min arrays.\n\n2. Compute the initial count of good indices.\n\n3. For each possible pair (i, j) where swapping them could potentially improve the count, compute the new count and track the maximum.\n\nBut since n is up to 2e5, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternative plan inspired by problem constraints and possible observations:\n\nThe optimal solution can be found by considering two candidates:\n\na) Find the best swap that creates two new good indices.\n\nb) Find the best swap that creates one new good index.\n\nIf such swaps exist, take the maximum between them and the initial count.\n\nOtherwise, the answer is the initial count.\n\nBut how to find these candidates quickly.\n\nLet's think about how to find swap pairs that can create two new good indices.\n\nFor a pair (i,j) to create two new good indices, after swapping, i's new value p[j} must be in (L[i}, R[i}), and j's new value p[i} must be in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nAn efficient way to do this would be to loop over each element x in the permutation, and for each x, check if there exists another element y such that x is in the range of y's position and y is in the range of x's position.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Precompute for each position i the set of possible elements that can be swapped into i to make it good. Then, for each such element y, check if swapping i with j (position of y) would also make j good with the new element.\n\nThis is similar to previous approaches.\n\nBut again, time constraints are a problem.\n\nAt this point, perhaps looking for a solution from the editorial or other sources would be helpful, but since I can't do that, I must proceed.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's think of the initial good indices. Those are i where p[i} is the first maximum up to i, and the first minimum from i to the end.\n\nWait, no. The condition for i being good is that all elements before are smaller than p[i}, which means p[i} is the maximum so far. Wait, no. Because if all elements before are smaller than p[i}, then p[i} is the maximum of the first i elements. But the left_max[i} is the maximum of the first i-1 elements. So if left_max[i} < p[i} and right_min[i} > p[i}, then i is good.\n\nSo the good indices are those that are record highs (strictly larger than all previous) and record lows (strictly smaller than all following).\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, if i has p[i} = 3, left max is 2, and right min is 4. Then p[i} is a record high up to i (since it's larger than all previous) and the next elements are all larger than 3.\n\nSo for such a position i, it's a good index.\n\nBut perhaps the good indices are those that are local maxima in the sense that they are the maximum up to their position and the minimum from their position onward. But that's not exactly correct. Because for example, i could be the maximum up to i, but not the minimum from i onward. The right_min[i} is the minimum of the elements after i. So p[i} must be less than that minimum.\n\nSo p[i} is less than the minimum of the elements after i. Which means all elements after i are larger than p[i}, so p[i} is the current minimum of the elements from i to n. But the p[i} is also the maximum of the elements up to i.\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. Because if p[i} is the maximum up to i, and also the minimum from i to n, then it's the maximum and the minimum of the entire array. Which means the array is a singleton. But since n is at least 2, this is impossible. So no position can be both the maximum up to i and the minimum from i. So maybe I made a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the array [2, 1], position 1: left_max[1} is 0 (or undefined, assuming it's the maximum of an empty array). So left_max[1} is considered 0. p[1} =2. Then right_min[1} is 1. So 2 < 1 is false. So i=1 is not good. i=2: left_max[2} is 2, right_min[2} is undefined (or n+1). p[2} =1. 1 < 2: no. So no good indices. \n\nAnother example: [1,3,2,4]. The good indices are 1 (since left is empty, right elements [3,2,4] are all larger than 1). i=4:left_max is 3 (max of [1,3,2]), which is 3. So 4>3 and right is empty. So good. So initial count is 2.\n\nSwapping i=2 and j=3 (3 and 2) makes the array [1,2,3,4], which has all good indices. So the swap adds 2 new good indices (i=2 and i=3).\n\nSo in this case, the swap between i=2 and j=3 (values 3 and 2) creates two new good indices.\n\nSo here, the swap satisfies that p[j} (2) is in the range (L[2}, R[2}). For i=2, L[2} is 1 (max of first 1 elements), R[2} is 2 (min of elements after 2: [2,4} is 2). So p_j=2 must be in (1, 2). But 2 is not in the open interval. Hmm, this seems confusing.\n\nWait, p_j=2 is in the range (1, 2) is not true. So why does swapping i=2 and j=3 (values 3 and 2) make i=2 and j=3 good?\n\nAfter the swap, the array becomes [1,2,3,4].\n\nFor i=2:\n\nleft_max[2} is 1 (max of first 1 elements). p_i=2>1. right_min[2} is 3 (min of [3,4}). 2 <3. So i=2 is good.\n\nFor i=3:\n\nleft_max[3} is 2 (max of [1,2,3} up to 2 elements?), wait, left_max[i} is the maximum of the first i-1 elements. So for i=3, left_max is max of [1,2} which is 2. p_i=3>2. right_min[i} is 4 (min of [4}), which is 4>3. So i=3 is good.\n\nSo the ranges for i=2 and j=3 (after swapping) are correct.\n\nBut in the original array, for i=2:\n\nL[i} =1, R[i} =2. So p_j=3 is not in (1, 2).\n\nAh, this suggests that the previous approach of checking if p_j is in the original L[i}, R[i} is not valid. Because after swapping other elements, the L and R arrays can change.\n\nSo the previous approach is incorrect. Thus, the answer is not as simple as checking if the original L and R conditions are met.\n\nThis means that the problem is more complex than previously thought. The swap can affect the L and R arrays for positions between i and j and possibly other positions. \n\nThus, the previous approach of checking for pairs where p_j is in (L[i}, R[i} ) and p_i is in (L[j}, R[j} ) is not sufficient.\n\nThis is a problem. Hence, perhaps the only way to find the optimal swap is to find a way to compute the new good indices after swapping i and j, but how to compute this quickly.\n\nAlternative idea: When swapping i and j, the new good indices are those that satisfy the new L and R arrays. However, the L and R arrays for the new permutation can be computed as follows:\n\nThe left_max array for the new permutation will change for positions from i to j (assuming i < j). Similarly, the right_min array will change for positions from j to i (if i > j).\n\nBut recomputing the left_max and right_min arrays for each swap is too expensive. So perhaps we can find that the only positions that can become good after swapping are i, j, and the positions between them.\n\nThis seems plausible. For example, swapping i and j (i < j) may affect only the left_max for positions i to j, since left_max is computed from left to right. Similarly, right_min may be affected for positions j to i.\n\nSo, when considering a swap between i and j (i < j), the possible new good indices could be in the range i to j.\n\nBut even if that's the case, checking each possible swap's impact on this region is still O(n) per swap, which is not feasible.\n\nThus, this problem seems to require a different approach.\n\nAfter some research (even though I can't do that now), I recall that the maximum number of good indices after one swap can be found by considering that the optimal swap is to swap the first occurrence where the left_max[i} >= p[i}, or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal swap is to swap two elements such that one of them becomes the new maximum up to some position and the other becomes the new minimum from some position. \n\nAlternatively, consider the following:\n\nThe good indices are those where p[i} is a prefix maximum and a suffix minimum. So, the elements that are both prefix maxima and suffix minima.\n\nSo, if we can find two elements, one a prefix maximum and the other a suffix minimum, perhaps swapping them can create new good indices.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The initial good indices are those that are both prefix maxima and suffix minima. So, the maximum number of good indices in any permutation is n (the sorted array). But after a swap, the maximum possible is n if the array becomes sorted.\n\nThus, in cases where the array can be sorted by a single swap, the answer is n. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether the array can be sorted with a single swap. If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nBut how to check if the array can be sorted with a single swap.\n\nThis is a known problem. The solution is to find all the places where the array is not sorted, and see if swapping two elements in those positions can sort the array.\n\nFor example, in the array [1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6], the first unsorted element is 5, and the last unsorted element is 2. Swapping 5 and 2 results in a sorted array.\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nThe standard approach is:\n\n1. Find the first index where p[i} > p[i+1}.\n\n2. Find the last index where p[j} < p[j-1}.\n\n3. Check if swapping p[i} and p[j} results in a sorted array.\n\n4. Alternatively, check if the subarray from i to j can be reversed to get a sorted array.\n\nBut this is for checking if the array can be sorted with a single swap or reverse.\n\nBut in our problem, even if the array can be sorted with a single swap, then swapping those two elements would make all positions good, thus giving f(p) = n. So the answer would be n.\n\nSo the first thing to check is: can the array be sorted with exactly one swap? If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to find the maximum f(p) by other swaps.\n\nBut how to check if the array can be sorted with one swap.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize first and last as -1.\n\nLoop from left to right to find the first index where p[i} > p[i+1}.\n\nLoop from right to left to find the last index where p[j} < p[j-1}.\n\nCheck if swapping p[i} and p[j} results in a sorted array.\n\nAlternatively, check if the array has exactly two positions where p[i} > p[i+1}; if so, those two positions may be swapped.\n\nBut this is a standard problem. For example, in the array [1,3,2,4], the first and last such positions are i=1 and j=2. Swapping them sorts the array.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFind the first and last position where the array is not sorted. Swap those elements and check if the result is sorted.\n\nIf yes, then the maximum answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to find other swaps.\n\nBut how to implement this in O(n) time.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. Check if the array can be sorted with exactly one swap. If yes, return n.\n\n2. If not, find the best possible swap that adds the most good indices.\n\nBut how to implement step 1.\n\nHere's how to check if the array can be sorted with a single swap:\n\n- Find all the indices where p[i} != sorted_p[i}, where sorted_p is the sorted version of the array.\n\n- If there are exactly two such indices, and swapping those two in the original array results in the sorted array, then yes.\n\n- Otherwise, no.\n\nThis can be done in O(n) time.\n\nOnce we know that the array can be sorted with a single swap, then swapping those two elements gives f(p) =n, which is the maximum possible.\n\nIf not, then we have to find the next best option.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the array is already sorted. If it is, then we must swap any two elements, which will reduce the count to n-2.\n\nBut if the array is not sorted, but can be sorted with a single swap, then the answer is n.\n\nIf the array can't be sorted with a single swap, then we need to proceed to find the optimal swap.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial count of good indices.\n\n2. Check if the array can be sorted with one swap. If yes, return n.\n\n3. Else, find the swap that gives the maximum possible increase in good indices.\n\nBut how.\n\nAssuming that the array can't be sorted with a single swap, the maximum possible increase is 2, but only if there's a swap that adds two new good indices. Hence, the algorithm would check for such swaps.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute initial count.\n\n2. Check if array can be sorted with one swap. If yes, return n.\n\n3. Else, find all possible swaps that can add two new good indices.\n\n4. If any, return initial + 2.\n\n5. Else, find all possible swaps that add one good index.\n\n6. Return the maximum of initial + 1 or initial.\n\nBut how to check for these swaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible gain is 2, and if no such swap exists, the maximum gain is 1.\n\nBut if even the maximum gain is 0, then the answer is the initial count.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAt this point, given time constraints, perhaps the answer is that the maximum possible f(p) after one swap is either n (if the array can be sorted with one swap) or the initial count plus 0, 1, or 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, given the problem's time constraints, the optimal algorithm is likely O(n) time.\n\nSo, the solution steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the initial count of good indices.\n\n2. Check if the array is already sorted. If yes, then the maximum possible after swap is n-2.\n\n3. Else, check if the array can be sorted with one swap. If yes, return n.\n\n4. Else, check for swaps that can add two good indices.\n\n5. If found, return initial + 2.\n\n6. Else, check for swaps that can add one good index, and return initial + 1 or initial.\n\nBut how to implement steps 4 and 5.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the answer is to check for the swap that can sort the array, and if possible, return n. Otherwise, the maximum possible is initial + 2 if such a pair exists.\n\nBut how to check for such pairs.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible is the initial count plus 2, which can be achieved if there exists a pair (i, j) where swapping them creates two new good indices. If such a pair exists, then answer is initial + 2. Else, answer is initial plus the maximum possible gain (which might be 1).\n\nBut how to find if such a pair exists.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible swap, the change in the number of good indices is the sum of the changes at i and j. Other positions may be affected, but it's difficult to track. Hence, perhaps the optimal approach is to check all possible pairs (i, j) where the swap would create two new good indices, ignoring the effect on other positions. This could be done by checking the conditions for i and j in the swapped array.\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2) time.\n\nBut given that the initial count can be up to n (for a sorted array), but for a non-sorted array, the optimal answer may be found by considering a few cases.\n\nAfter trying to find a pattern, perhaps the maximum possible f(p) after exactly one swap is:\n\n- n if the array can be sorted with one swap.\n\n- Otherwise, the initial count plus 2 if there exists a pair (i, j) such that swapping them creates two new good indices.\n\n- Else, initial count plus 1 or initial.\n\nBut without knowing how to efficiently find such pairs, I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the correct answer for this problem is that the maximum possible f(p) after exactly one swap is either n (if the array can be sorted with one swap) or the initial count plus 2.\n\nBut how to confirm.\n\nIn the example [1,3,2,4], swapping 3 and 2 gives a sorted array, so answer is 4.\n\nIn the example [3,1,2], the array can be sorted by swapping 3 and 1, resulting in [1,3,2], which is not sorted. So no. So the answer is 1 (initial count was 0, and after swap, i=1 is good, so count is 1).\n\nBut in this case, there's no way to sort the array with one swap. Swapping 3 and 2 gives [2,1,3], which has one good index (i=3).\n\nSo in such cases, the answer depends on the initial count plus the maximum possible gain.\n\nThus, the optimal answer is:\n\nIf the array can be sorted with one swap: n.\n\nElse, compute the initial count and find the best possible swap.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal answer is to return the initial count plus 2 if there exists a swap that increases the count by 2, else initial count plus 1, else initial count.\n\nBut again, how to find this.\n\nGiven time constraints, I think the correct answer is that the maximum possible f(p) after one swap is n if the array can be sorted with a single swap. Otherwise, the maximum is the initial count plus 2 if two new good indices can be created, and so on.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, the answer is likely n if sorted after a swap, else the Initial count plus 2, but how.\n\nBut without further analysis, I'm unable to proceed.\n\nAfter reviewing the problem again, I see that the initial count is computed based on the current p array. Then, the swap must be performed exactly once. The maximum possible f(p) after the swap is the answer.\n\nThe answer will depend on whether there's a swap that can create a sorted array (which gives n good indices), else look for the best possible pair.\n\nBut since the time constraints are tight, the only way to proceed is with an O(n) solution.\n\nThe key insight is that after a swap, the maximum possible good indices increase by 2 if the two swapped elements are the only ones not in their correct positions in the sorted array. Hence, the answer is n in such cases.\n\nOtherwise, the answer is the initial count plus 2 if there exists any pair (i, j) that can add two good indices, which is possible if the two elements fit the required ranges for each other's positions.\n\nBut without a way to compute this efficiently, I'll proceed to write the answer based on the initial analysis.\n</think>\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of \"good\" indices in a permutation after performing exactly one swap.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem says that for a given permutation p of length n, we need to find the maximum possible number of \"good\" indices after exactly one swap. A good index i is one where all elements before i are smaller than p_i and all elements after are larger than p_i. \n\nSo first, I need to understand what makes an index good. Let's break it down. For index i to be good, two conditions must hold:\n1. All elements before i (y < i) must be less than p_i. So p_i must be greater than the maximum of the first i-1 elements.\n2. All elements after i (y > i) must be greater than p_i. So p_i must be less than the minimum of the elements from i+1 to n.\n\nWait, yes. So for each position i, the maximum of the prefix up to i-1 (let's call it left_max[i]) must be less than p_i, and the minimum of the suffix starting at i+1 (right_min[i]) must be greater than p_i. If both conditions are true, then i is a good index.\n\nThe initial step is to compute, for each position i, the left_max and right_min arrays. Then, we can find the current number of good indices.\n\nNow, the challenge is to determine how swapping two elements can maximize the number of good indices. We can perform exactly one swap. So the approach would be to consider all possible pairs (i, j) and compute how the swap affects the good indices. However, checking all pairs is O(n\u00b2), which is not feasible for n up to 2e5. So we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find which swap would give the maximum increase in good indices. Let's think about how a swap affects the left_max and right_min arrays. Changing two elements can affect the left_max and right_min of various positions, not just i and j. For example, if we swap elements at positions i and j (i < j), then any position between i and j could be affected. This seems complicated because a single swap can alter multiple left_max and right_min values.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter approach. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's compute the initial good indices. Let's precompute left_max and right_min arrays. Then, the initial count is the sum over i where left_max[i] < p_i and right_min[i] > p_i.\n\nNow, when we swap elements at positions i and j (i < j, say), the elements p_i and p_j are exchanged. Let's denote the new array as p'. So p'[i] = p_j and p'[j] = p_i. For other positions, the elements remain the same.\n\nThe swap can affect the left_max and right_min arrays. The left_max array is computed from left to right. So if i < j, swapping them can affect the left_max for positions from i to j. Similarly, the right_min array is computed from right to left, so swapping i and j (assuming i < j) might affect the right_min for positions from j downto i.\n\nBut recomputing all left_max and right_min after each possible swap is too time-consuming. So we need a way to calculate the potential new number of good indices for each possible swap in O(1) time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where a swap between a certain pair of elements can create new good indices that weren't there before. For example, swapping a large element from the right with a small element from the left could create a new maximum in the left part or a new minimum in the right part.\n\nWait. Let's consider that when we swap p_i and p_j (i < j), then:\n\nFor position i: in the new array, p'[i] = p_j. The left_max[i] would be the max of the first i-1 elements (which are unchanged if i's element was swapped). Wait, no: the left_max up to i-1 is the same as before, since those elements weren't swapped. So the left_max for i in the new array would be max(left_max[i-1], p_j). Similarly, the right_min for i would be the same as before, except that the suffix after i now has swapped elements.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's see. Suppose we swap i and j. For any position k < i, the left_max is unchanged. For k >= i, the left_max could change if in the original array, the max up to k was either p_i or p_j, but after swapping, it's different.\n\nSimilarly, for right_min: any position k > j would have the same right_min. For positions between i and j, the right_min could change if the original min in the suffix up to k was p_i or p_j.\n\nBut recomputing entire left_max and right_min arrays for each possible swap is not feasible. So maybe we need to find a way to find pairs where swapping them can create two new good indices (i and j), and perhaps not disrupt existing ones. Alternatively, perhaps swapping elements that are the maximum possible in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, think about possible candidates for swapping. For a swap to be useful, perhaps we can swap an element from the left that is not a good index with an element from the right that is not a good index, but after swapping, both positions become good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal swap is to swap the maximum element to the first position, but that might not always be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal answer can be found by considering two elements a and b in the permutation such that when swapped, they create as many new good indices as possible, while not breaking existing ones (or possibly breaking some, but net gain is higher).\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible f(p) after swap is the initial count plus some gain from swapping. The best possible gain is adding two new good indices (i and j), but that's possible only under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible f(p) after swap is n-1. For example, if the permutation is sorted except for two elements, then swapping them would make all elements except maybe one good. But n-1 is possible? Let's see.\n\nIn a sorted array in increasing order, every element is a good index. Because for any i, all elements before are smaller (since sorted), and all elements after are larger. So the initial f(p) is n. So any swap would reduce it. But in that case, the maximum is n. But if the array is almost sorted except for two elements, perhaps swapping two elements can give n-1. However, the problem says that we have to perform exactly one swap. So even if the array is already sorted, we have to swap two elements, which would reduce the count to n-2. So the maximum possible f(p) after swap is not n, but perhaps n-1 in certain cases.\n\nBut how to approach this algorithmically.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible pair (i, j), compute how the swap affects the count of good indices. The problem is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut checking all pairs is O(n\u00b2), which is too slow. So we need to find a way to find the best possible swap in O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal swap is one of a few specific possibilities. For example:\n\n1. Swap the first occurrence where a left element is smaller than a right element.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the maximum possible gain. The initial count is some C. The best swap would add some D good indices and subtract some E bad, so the net gain is D-E. We need to find the maximum possible D-E.\n\nBut how to compute D and E for each possible swap.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible swap (i, j), compute the new number of good indices. The difficulty is how to compute this quickly.\n\nLet's think: when we swap i and j, the new elements at positions i and j are p_j and p_i. The rest of the array is the same. So, to compute the new good indices after swap, we need to check for each position whether it's good in the new array.\n\nBut checking all positions after a swap is O(n), but for each possible swap, this would be O(n\u00b2) time. Not feasible.\n\nThus, we need to find a way to model the effect of the swap on the good indices in O(1) or O(1) per candidate pair.\n\nHmm. Let's think:\n\nThe original good indices are those that meet the conditions based on the original left_max and right_min. When we swap i and j, the left_max and right_min arrays may change for some positions. However, recomputing the entire left_max and right_min after a swap is O(n), which again is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: the swap affects the left_max and right_min arrays only for positions between min(i,j) and max(i,j). So perhaps, for a swap between i and j (i < j), the left_max array from 1 to i-1 is the same. Starting from i, since the element at i is now p_j, the left_max for i would be max(left_max[i-1], p_j). Then for position i+1, left_max becomes max(left_max_new[i], new_p[i+1]), but new_p[i+1] is same as original except if j is i+1.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let's think for a swap between positions i and j where i < j:\n\nAfter the swap:\n\n- The elements from 1 to i-1 are same as before. So left_max for positions 1 to i-1 is same as original.\n\nAt position i: p'[i] = p_j. The left_max_new[i] is max(original left_max[i-1], p_j).\n\nFor positions i+1 to j: the left_max_new[k] depends on the previous left_max_new[k-1] and p[k] in the new array. But the new array's elements from i+1 to j-1 are same as before, except if j is among them. Wait, j is larger than i. So positions i+1 to j-1 are same as original. Only positions i and j are swapped.\n\nSo, for example, if we swap positions i and j (i < j), then the left_max array after i can be different up to j. Because when you compute left_max from left to right, after the swap, the left_max for i is the max of left_max[i-1] (unchanged) and the new element at i (p_j). Then, for position i+1, the left_max would be max(left_max_new[i], p[i+1]) (since p[i+1] is same as before). Unless j is i+1, in which case p[j] is now p_i. \n\nThis seems too complicated for a general case. So perhaps, for each possible swap candidate, we can only check the positions i and j, and their nearby positions, but that might not capture all the changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal swap would be where after swapping, one of the swapped elements creates a new good index, perhaps both i and j become good, and/or some other positions.\n\nBut how to find such a pair.\n\nAnother angle: For each position i, check what element would make i a good index if it was placed there. Then find if there exists such an element in the array which can be swapped with the current element at i. But this is vague.\n\nWait, let's suppose that position i needs to have a value x such that x is greater than the maximum of the prefix up to i-1, and less than the minimum of the suffix from i+1. Let the maximum of the prefix up to i-1 be L[i], and the minimum of the suffix from i+1 be R[i]. Then, the required x for i to be good is x must satisfy L[i] < x < R[i]. Moreover, x must be present in the array, but not at position i. So if there exists a position j such that p[j] is in (L[i], R[i]), then swapping i and j would make i a good index. But also, swapping could affect j's status.\n\nBut this seems possible. For example, for each i, check if there is any element in the array that is in (L[i], R[i]). Then swapping that element with i's current element would make i a good index. Then, perhaps the maximum gain would be 2 if both i and j (after swap) become good, but not sure.\n\nBut this approach requires for each i, checking if such elements exist. However, for each i, the (L[i], R[i]) is a range, and we need to see if any element in the array (outside of i) is in that range. Then, swapping i with such an element's position would make i good. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, let's precompute for each position i, the L[i] and R[i]. Then, for each element x in the array, if x is in the range (L[i], R[i]), then swapping x (which is at position j) with position i could possibly make i a good index.\n\nBut also, after swapping, the element at j (which was p_i) may or may not be a good index. So for each possible candidate pair (i, j), the gain is the sum of:\n\n- whether i becomes good (if p_j is in (L[i], R[i]))\n- whether j becomes good (if p_i is in (L'[j], R'[j}), but L' and R' would change after swapping)\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to consider two scenarios:\n\n1. Find two positions i and j such that swapping them adds two new good indices (i and j). Then the maximum possible gain is +2.\n\n2. Find a position i where swapping with j adds one new good index, and j may lose or gain.\n\nBut how to find these scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible f(p) after the swap is the initial count plus 2. So we need to check if there exists a swap that adds two good indices. If yes, then the answer is initial + 2. Else, check for swaps that add 1, etc.\n\nLet me think of some examples.\n\nExample 1: Original permutation is [2,1], n=2.\n\nThe initial good indices: for i=1, check left (nothing) and right (1). So left_max[1] is undefined (0?), and right_min[1] is 1. So p_1=2 must be less than right_min[1] (1). 2 <1 is false. So i=1 is not good. For i=2, left_max[2] is 2 (max of [2,1] up to index 2-1=1 is 2), and right_min[2] is undefined (n+1). So p_2=1 must be greater than left_max (2). 1>2 is false. So initial count is 0.\n\nAfter swapping, the permutation becomes [1,2]. Both indices are good. So initial count was 0, after swap it's 2. So gain is +2.\n\nSo here, the optimal is adding two good indices. So in this case, the maximum possible is 2.\n\nAnother example: [3,1,2]. Initial good indices: i=1. Let's see:\n\nFor i=1: left is empty. Right elements (1,2) must all be >3. But 1 and 2 are less than 3, so no. So i=1 is not good. For i=2: left elements [3], which must be <1? No. So i=2 not good. For i=3: left elements [3,1], which max is 3. So 2 must be >3. No. So initial count is 0.\n\nIf we swap elements 1 and 3: the permutation becomes [3,2,1]. Which probably has no good indices.\n\nAlternatively, swap 3 and 2: [2,1,3]. For i=1, right elements are [1,3]. All must be >2. 1 is not. So not good. For i=3: left elements are [2,1], max 2 <3, so yes. So i=3 is good. So count is 1. So gain is +1.\n\nAlternatively, swap 1 and 2: [3,2,1]. Again, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, swap 3 and 1: [1,3,2]. Check i=1: right elements [3,2] must be >1. Yes. So i=1 is good. i=2: left max is 3. p_i=3. 3 >=3? Wait, left_max[i] is the maximum of the first i-1 elements. For i=2, left_max[2] is 1 (max of first 1 elements). So 3>1, and right_min[2] is 2. 3 <2? No. So i=2 is not good. i=3: left max is 3 (max of first 2 elements [1,3] is 3). p_i=2 <3? No. So i=3 is not good. So count is 1. So gain is +1.\n\nSo in this example, the maximum gain is 1.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pair that gives gain of 2.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,2,4]. Initial good indices:\n\ni=1: left is empty, right elements must be >1. Yes. So good. i=1 is good.\n\ni=2: left elements [1], max is 1. p_i=3>1. Right elements [2,4], min is 2. 3 <2? No. So i=2 is not good.\n\ni=3: left elements [1,3], max is 3. p_i=2 <3. So not good.\n\ni=4: left elements [1,3,2], max is 3. p_i=4>3. Right is empty. So good. So initial count is 2.\n\nIf we swap elements 3 and 2: [1,2,3,4]. All indices are good. So count is 4. So gain is +2. So here, swapping 3 and 2 gives a gain of +2.\n\nThus, the maximum possible is 4.\n\nSo swapping elements that are in the wrong order, correcting it, could increase the count.\n\nSo the problem is to find such pairs where swapping them turns two positions into good indices, or perhaps more.\n\nBut how to find this without checking all possible pairs.\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each element x in the array, the positions where it can be placed to create a new good index. Then, for each possible x and position j, see if there's a way to swap x with its current position and j such that both positions become good.\n\nBut again, this is a vague plan.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i, the current value p_i can potentially be swapped with a value that is larger than L[i] and smaller than R[i]. If such a value exists in the array, then swapping i with that position j would make i a good index. But j's value (p_i) would need to satisfy its own L[j] and R[j] criteria.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal swap is when after swap, two new good indices are created. For that to happen, the swapped elements must each fit into their new positions' L and R ranges.\n\nSo for positions i and j, after swapping, p_i (now at j) must be larger than L[j] and smaller than R[j], and p_j (now at i) must be larger than L[i] and smaller than R[i].\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\np_j > L[i] and p_j < R[i]\n\np_i > L[j] and p_i < R[j]\n\nIf both these conditions are met, then swapping i and j would make both positions i and j good, provided that the left_max and right_min arrays are not affected in other positions. However, this might not be the case. For example, swapping i and j may affect the left_max for positions between i and j (if i < j), which could turn other positions into bad ones. So even if the two positions i and j become good, other positions may become bad.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps considering these two conditions is a way to find a possible maximum gain, and the actual answer would involve checking all such pairs where swapping i and j gives both i and j as good.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut checking all pairs for these two conditions is O(n\u00b2), which is not feasible. So perhaps we need to find a way to find such pairs in O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, precompute for each position i, the pairs (i, j) where j is a position such that p_j is in (L[i], R[i}), and p_i is in (L[j], R[j}).\n\nBut even this seems O(n\u00b2) in the worst case.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the possible candidates.\n\nFor a pair (i, j) to be a candidate where swapping gives both i and j as good, the following must hold:\n\np_j must be > L[i] and < R[i], and p_i must be > L[j] and < R[j].\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nAlternatively, for each element x in the array, let's note all positions i where x could be placed to make i a good index. Then, for x and y, if x is placed in i, and y is placed in j, and x and y are in each other's possible positions, then swapping could create two good indices.\n\nBut this is too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum gain is 2, but only if such a pair exists. If not, then the maximum gain is 1 or 0.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n1. Compute the initial count of good indices.\n\n2. Check if there exists a pair (i, j) where swapping them adds 2 good indices. If yes, return initial + 2.\n\n3. Else, check if there exists a pair that adds 1 good index.\n\n4. The answer is the maximum of initial, initial + 1, or initial + 2.\n\nBut how to implement steps 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible is initial + 2, initial +1, or initial.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding if there's a pair that gives two new good indices, otherwise check for one.\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nLet's think again about the example where the array becomes sorted after swap. For instance, in the example [3,1,2,4], swapping 3 and 1 gives [1,3,2,4]. Then i=1 is good, i=4 is still good, but the sorted array has all good indices. So when the array is not sorted, but can be sorted with one swap, then the answer would be n, but in the problem statement, the initial array is a permutation. However, after swapping, if the array is sorted, then every position i is good. So the maximum possible is n. But the problem requires exactly one swap. So if the array is already sorted, we have to swap two elements, which would reduce the count to n-2.\n\nBut if the array can be sorted with one swap, then the answer is n. For example, the array [1,3,2,4], which can be sorted by swapping 3 and 2, leading to all indices being good. So in this case, the swap between 2 and 3 (positions 2 and 3) gives 4 good indices.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible is either the initial count, initial + 1, or initial + 2. But how to find when it's possible to get a swap that gives more.\n\nBut how to check for pairs that when swapped would create two new good indices.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, find all j where p_j is in (L[i], R[i}) and p_i is in (L[j], R[j}).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i, compute the possible value that can be placed here to make it good. That value x must be in (L[i], R[i]).\n\nThen, for each value x in (L[i], R[i}), find the position j where p_j = x, and check whether placing x in i and p_i in j would make j a good index. That is, p_i should be in (L[j], R[j}).\n\nBut this requires for each i, to iterate over all possible x in (L[i], R[i}) and check if x's original position j has L[j] < p_i < R[j}.\n\nThis could be done by precomputing a map from values to their positions. Then for each i, for x in (L[i}, R[i}), find j = position[x], and check if p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nIf such a pair exists, then swapping i and j would make both i and j good.\n\nThis approach would require, for each i, to iterate through all values x in (L[i}, R[i}) and check their j's L and R. However, the ranges (L[i}, R[i}) could be large, but in practice, for permutations, each x is unique. The number of x in (L[i}, R[i}) is (R[i} - L[i} -1) possible values, but R[i} can be up to n+1, so this approach is O(n) per i, which is O(n\u00b2), which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to find such pairs quickly.\n\nAlternatively, let's precompute for each value x, the positions j where x is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nThen, for each i, if there exists a j where p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}), then swapping i and j could create two good indices. But this would require checking for each i whether there's such a j.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, create a hash map where for each value x, store all positions j where x is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nThen, for each i, check if there is a j in the map for x = p_i, such that p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the desired x for position i is in (L[i}, R[i}). So the positions j where p_j is x in (L[i}, R[i}) can be found by looking at the values in that interval.\n\nBut given that the permutation consists of distinct elements, we can precompute for each value x, its position in the array (since it's a permutation, each x is present once). Then, for each i, the set of possible j is the set of positions where p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nSo for each i, iterate over all x in (L[i}+1, R[i}-1), and check if x exists (which it does) and find j = pos[x]. Then, check if p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut this is O(n) per i, which is again O(n\u00b2) time.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is not feasible. So this approach is not suitable.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative plan: The optimal swap is to swap two elements such that in the new array, both elements are at positions where their values are in the correct range. Let's assume that swapping i and j would make both i and j good. Then, the conditions are:\n\nFor i:\n\nnew_p[i] = p_j should be in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nFor j:\n\nnew_p[j] = p_i should be in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nAdditionally, other positions may be affected. But assuming that other positions are not affected (which is not necessarily true), then this swap would give a gain of 2. However, the other positions could lose their good status, but perhaps this is the best possible scenario.\n\nBut how to find such pairs (i, j) efficiently.\n\nLet's precompute for each position i, the possible x that can be placed in i to make it a good index. x must be in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nNow, for the elements in [L[i}+1, R[i}-1], their positions are known.\n\nFor each such x in this range, let j be the position of x. Now, check if p_i (original) is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nIf yes, then swapping i and j would make both i and j good indices.\n\nSo, for each i, we need to look up all x in the range (L[i}, R[i}) and check if their corresponding j's have p_i in the range (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut checking all x in the range for each i is O(n\u00b2) time in the worst case (if for every i, the range (L[i}, R[i}) is O(n)).\n\nThus, we need a way to find for each i, whether there exists any x in (L[i}, R[i}) such that p_i is in (L[j}, R[j} ), where j is the position of x.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother idea: For each value x in the array, precompute the ranges (L[j}, R[j}) for their position j. Then, for each i, check if there exists a j where x = p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nThis can be done by for each j, store the (L[j}, R[j}) intervals. Then, for each i, iterate over all x in (L[i}, R[i}) and check if p_i is in the interval (L[j}, R[j}), where j is the position of x.\n\nBut again, this is O(n) per i.\n\nAlternative plan: \n\nThe maximum possible gain is 2. So we can first check if there exists any pair (i, j) such that swapping them results in both i and j becoming good. If such a pair exists, then the answer is initial count + 2. If not, check for pairs that result in a gain of 1.\n\nBut how to check for pairs (i, j) that satisfy the two conditions:\n\np_j is in (L[i}, R[i}) \n\np_i is in (L[j}, R[j} )\n\nBut checking for this in O(n) time.\n\nPerhaps, precompute for each value x the positions j where x is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nThen, for each i, check if there's a j in the set of positions where x = p_i is in (L[j}, R[j} ), and p_j is in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can compute the range (L[i}, R[i}) and see if there's any j in the array where p_j is in that range and p_i is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut again, checking for each i is O(n) time.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the L and R arrays. \n\nCompute L as the prefix maxima. For each i, L[i] is the maximum of p[1..i-1].\n\nCompute R as the suffix minima. For each i, R[i] is the minimum of p[i+1..n].\n\nSo for each position i, the required value for a good index is in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nNow, for the array, the permutation has values from 1 to n.\n\nSo for each i, the range (L[i}, R[i}) is a interval. For example, if L[i} is 3 and R[i} is 5, then the required value is 4.\n\nBut in the permutation, the value 4 is at some position j.\n\nThus, for each i, if there's a j such that p[j] is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p[i] is in (L[j}, R[j} ), then swapping i and j would make both i and j good.\n\nBut how to find such a pair (i,j) in O(n) time.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, check if p[i] is in the range (L[j}, R[j} ), where j is the position of a value in (L[i}, R[i}).\n\nBut to find this quickly, perhaps create a hash map or array that maps each value to its position. Then for each i, iterate over all possible values in the range (L[i}, R[i}) and check if p[i] is in the range of their corresponding positions.\n\nBut this is O(n^2) in worst case.\n\nBut considering that the permutation contains unique values, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible pair (i, j), the only way swapping them can add two good indices is if p[j] is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p[i] is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nSo for each i, can we find a j where p[j] is in (L[i}, R[i}) and p[i] is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nIf we can find such a j for any i, then swapping i and j gives a gain of 2.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding such a pair.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nHere's an approach:\n\n1. Precompute L and R arrays.\n\n2. Create a dictionary value_pos that maps each value to its position.\n\n3. For each i in 1..n:\n\n   a. Check the range (L[i], R[i}).\n\n   b. For each value x in (L[i], R[i} ), check if x exists in the array. Since it's a permutation, x exists exactly once.\n\n   c. Get j = value_pos[x].\n\n   d. Check if p[i] is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nIf yes, then swapping i and j gives both good indices.\n\nBut how to find x in (L[i}, R[i} ) efficiently.\n\nThe problem is that for each i, the range (L[i}, R[i} ) can be large, and iterating through all x in this range is O(n) per i.\n\nHowever, it's possible that in some cases, the range is empty. For example, if L[i} >= R[i}, then there are no x in the range. So for such i, there's no possible x to swap with.\n\nBut for permutations, L[i} and R[i} are such that L[i} < R[i} in some cases.\n\nFor example, if i is a good index, then L[i} < p[i} < R[i}, but [x for x in (L[i}, R[i} )] would include p[i}, but since x must be swapped, we're looking for other values.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\nLet's think of a way to find pairs (i, j) where:\n\n- p[j] > L[i} and p[j} < R[i}\n\n- p[i} > L[j} and p[i} < R[j}\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother idea is to precompute for each position j, the set of possible i such that p[j} is in (L[i}, R[i} ), and p[i} is in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a swap to create two new good indices, the two elements must fit into each other's intervals.\n\nSo, the elements p[i} and p[j} must satisfy p[j} is in the interval of i, and p[i} is in the interval of j.\n\nSo, to find such pairs, we can iterate through all possible pairs i < j, check if the two conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut this is O(n\u00b2), which is not feasible.\n\nHence, we need to find a way to find such pairs quickly.\n\nAnother idea: For each j, compute the interval (L[j}, R[j} ). Then, for each j, if there's an i where p[i} is in (L[j}, R[j} ), and p[j} is in (L[i}, R[i} ), then swapping i and j would create two good indices.\n\nBut again, it's unclear how to find such pairs.\n\nPerhaps, for each j, we can look for i's where p[j} is in (L[i}, R[i} ) and p[i} is in (L[j}, R[j} ).\n\nBut again, this is O(n\u00b2) time.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe maximum possible f(p) after swap is either:\n\n- The current count plus 2 (if such a swap exists),\n\n- Current count plus 1,\n\n- or the current count.\n\nSo, the algorithm should compute these possibilities.\n\nBut how to compute them.\n\nAnother observation: when you swap two elements, you can affect at most O(1) new good indices. Because the swap affects the left_max and right_min arrays, which can change for a range of positions. But this can lead to multiple good indices being added or removed. Hence, the maximum gain may be more than 2.\n\nBut in practice, it's difficult to find such cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best candidate pairs are those where i and j are in certain positions, such as the first and last positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For each position i, check if swapping it with the position where the maximum in the entire array is located can yield a gain.\n\nAlternatively, consider swapping the global maximum to the first position, but this would only affect the good indices for the first position.\n\nAlternatively, swap the smallest element to the end.\n\nBut this is not systematic.\n\nWait, the first position's good condition requires that all elements after are larger than p[1]. So if we swap p[1] with a smaller element, then p[1] would have a higher chance of being good. For example, if we make p[1] the smallest element, then all elements after would be larger, making i=1 a good index.\n\nBut after swapping, the element that was swapped into position 1 (previously at position j) may also become good if its new position j's conditions are met.\n\nBut how to find such j.\n\nAlternatively, to make i=1 good after swapping, the new element at i=1 should be smaller than the original R[1} (the minimum of the suffix starting at 2). So if we swap i=1 with j where p[j} < R[1}, then i=1 becomes good.\n\nBut also, the element p[1} is now at j. For j to be good, p[1} must be greater than the maximum of the elements before j in the original array (since after swapping, the elements before j are unchanged except for position 1 if j>1. So if j is 3, the elements before j in the original array are the same as before except position 1's original value is now at j.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the best approach is to look for an answer pattern. For example, the maximum possible f(p) after swap is either the current count plus 2, or the current count plus 1, or the current count. So, the optimal answer is computed by checking all possible pairs that could give +2, +1, or select the best.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAfter trying various ideas and still not finding a way to compute this efficiently, perhaps the solution involves the following steps:\n\n1. Precompute left_max and right_min arrays.\n\n2. Compute the initial count of good indices.\n\n3. For each possible pair (i, j) where swapping them could potentially improve the count, compute the new count and track the maximum.\n\nBut since n is up to 2e5, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternative plan inspired by problem constraints and possible observations:\n\nThe optimal solution can be found by considering two candidates:\n\na) Find the best swap that creates two new good indices.\n\nb) Find the best swap that creates one new good index.\n\nIf such swaps exist, take the maximum between them and the initial count.\n\nOtherwise, the answer is the initial count.\n\nBut how to find these candidates quickly.\n\nLet's think about how to find swap pairs that can create two new good indices.\n\nFor a pair (i,j) to create two new good indices, after swapping, i's new value p[j} must be in (L[i}, R[i}), and j's new value p[i} must be in (L[j}, R[j}).\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nAn efficient way to do this would be to loop over each element x in the permutation, and for each x, check if there exists another element y such that x is in the range of y's position and y is in the range of x's position.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Precompute for each position i the set of possible elements that can be swapped into i to make it good. Then, for each such element y, check if swapping i with j (position of y) would also make j good with the new element.\n\nThis is similar to previous approaches.\n\nBut again, time constraints are a problem.\n\nAt this point, perhaps looking for a solution from the editorial or other sources would be helpful, but since I can't do that, I must proceed.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's think of the initial good indices. Those are i where p[i} is the first maximum up to i, and the first minimum from i to the end.\n\nWait, no. The condition for i being good is that all elements before are smaller than p[i}, which means p[i} is the maximum so far. Wait, no. Because if all elements before are smaller than p[i}, then p[i} is the maximum of the first i elements. But the left_max[i} is the maximum of the first i-1 elements. So if left_max[i} < p[i} and right_min[i} > p[i}, then i is good.\n\nSo the good indices are those that are record highs (strictly larger than all previous) and record lows (strictly smaller than all following).\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, if i has p[i} = 3, left max is 2, and right min is 4. Then p[i} is a record high up to i (since it's larger than all previous) and the next elements are all larger than 3.\n\nSo for such a position i, it's a good index.\n\nBut perhaps the good indices are those that are local maxima in the sense that they are the maximum up to their position and the minimum from their position onward. But that's not exactly correct. Because for example, i could be the maximum up to i, but not the minimum from i onward. The right_min[i} is the minimum of the elements after i. So p[i} must be less than that minimum.\n\nSo p[i} is less than the minimum of the elements after i. Which means all elements after i are larger than p[i}, so p[i} is the current minimum of the elements from i to n. But the p[i} is also the maximum of the elements up to i.\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. Because if p[i} is the maximum up to i, and also the minimum from i to n, then it's the maximum and the minimum of the entire array. Which means the array is a singleton. But since n is at least 2, this is impossible. So no position can be both the maximum up to i and the minimum from i. So maybe I made a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the array [2, 1], position 1: left_max[1} is 0 (or undefined, assuming it's the maximum of an empty array). So left_max[1} is considered 0. p[1} =2. Then right_min[1} is 1. So 2 < 1 is false. So i=1 is not good. i=2: left_max[2} is 2, right_min[2} is undefined (or n+1). p[2} =1. 1 < 2: no. So no good indices. \n\nAnother example: [1,3,2,4]. The good indices are 1 (since left is empty, right elements [3,2,4] are all larger than 1). i=4:left_max is 3 (max of [1,3,2]), which is 3. So 4>3 and right is empty. So good. So initial count is 2.\n\nSwapping i=2 and j=3 (3 and 2) makes the array [1,2,3,4], which has all good indices. So the swap adds 2 new good indices (i=2 and i=3).\n\nSo in this case, the swap between i=2 and j=3 (values 3 and 2) creates two new good indices.\n\nSo here, the swap satisfies that p[j} (2) is in the range (L[2}, R[2}). For i=2, L[2} is 1 (max of first 1 elements), R[2} is 2 (min of elements after 2: [2,4} is 2). So p_j=2 must be in (1, 2). But 2 is not in the open interval. Hmm, this seems confusing.\n\nWait, p_j=2 is in the range (1, 2) is not true. So why does swapping i=2 and j=3 (values 3 and 2) make i=2 and j=3 good?\n\nAfter the swap, the array becomes [1,2,3,4].\n\nFor i=2:\n\nleft_max[2} is 1 (max of first 1 elements). p_i=2>1. right_min[2} is 3 (min of [3,4}). 2 <3. So i=2 is good.\n\nFor i=3:\n\nleft_max[3} is 2 (max of [1,2,3} up to 2 elements?), wait, left_max[i} is the maximum of the first i-1 elements. So for i=3, left_max is max of [1,2} which is 2. p_i=3>2. right_min[i} is 4 (min of [4}), which is 4>3. So i=3 is good.\n\nSo the ranges for i=2 and j=3 (after swapping) are correct.\n\nBut in the original array, for i=2:\n\nL[i} =1, R[i} =2. So p_j=3 is not in (1, 2).\n\nAh, this suggests that the previous approach of checking if p_j is in the original L[i}, R[i} is not valid. Because after swapping other elements, the L and R arrays can change.\n\nSo the previous approach is incorrect. Thus, the answer is not as simple as checking if the original L and R conditions are met.\n\nThis means that the problem is more complex than previously thought. The swap can affect the L and R arrays for positions between i and j and possibly other positions. \n\nThus, the previous approach of checking for pairs where p_j is in (L[i}, R[i} ) and p_i is in (L[j}, R[j} ) is not sufficient.\n\nThis is a problem. Hence, perhaps the only way to find the optimal swap is to find a way to compute the new good indices after swapping i and j, but how to compute this quickly.\n\nAlternative idea: When swapping i and j, the new good indices are those that satisfy the new L and R arrays. However, the L and R arrays for the new permutation can be computed as follows:\n\nThe left_max array for the new permutation will change for positions from i to j (assuming i < j). Similarly, the right_min array will change for positions from j to i (if i > j).\n\nBut recomputing the left_max and right_min arrays for each swap is too expensive. So perhaps we can find that the only positions that can become good after swapping are i, j, and the positions between them.\n\nThis seems plausible. For example, swapping i and j (i < j) may affect only the left_max for positions i to j, since left_max is computed from left to right. Similarly, right_min may be affected for positions j to i.\n\nSo, when considering a swap between i and j (i < j), the possible new good indices could be in the range i to j.\n\nBut even if that's the case, checking each possible swap's impact on this region is still O(n) per swap, which is not feasible.\n\nThus, this problem seems to require a different approach.\n\nAfter some research (even though I can't do that now), I recall that the maximum number of good indices after one swap can be found by considering that the optimal swap is to swap the first occurrence where the left_max[i} >= p[i}, or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal swap is to swap two elements such that one of them becomes the new maximum up to some position and the other becomes the new minimum from some position. \n\nAlternatively, consider the following:\n\nThe good indices are those where p[i} is a prefix maximum and a suffix minimum. So, the elements that are both prefix maxima and suffix minima.\n\nSo, if we can find two elements, one a prefix maximum and the other a suffix minimum, perhaps swapping them can create new good indices.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: The initial good indices are those that are both prefix maxima and suffix minima. So, the maximum number of good indices in any permutation is n (the sorted array). But after a swap, the maximum possible is n if the array becomes sorted.\n\nThus, in cases where the array can be sorted by a single swap, the answer is n. Otherwise, it's less.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is whether the array can be sorted with a single swap. If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nBut how to check if the array can be sorted with a single swap.\n\nThis is a known problem. The solution is to find all the places where the array is not sorted, and see if swapping two elements in those positions can sort the array.\n\nFor example, in the array [1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6], the first unsorted element is 5, and the last unsorted element is 2. Swapping 5 and 2 results in a sorted array.\n\nBut how to find such pairs.\n\nThe standard approach is:\n\n1. Find the first index where p[i} > p[i+1}.\n\n2. Find the last index where p[j} < p[j-1}.\n\n3. Check if swapping p[i} and p[j} results in a sorted array.\n\n4. Alternatively, check if the subarray from i to j can be reversed to get a sorted array.\n\nBut this is for checking if the array can be sorted with a single swap or reverse.\n\nBut in our problem, even if the array can be sorted with a single swap, then swapping those two elements would make all positions good, thus giving f(p) = n. So the answer would be n.\n\nSo the first thing to check is: can the array be sorted with exactly one swap? If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to find the maximum f(p) by other swaps.\n\nBut how to check if the array can be sorted with one swap.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize first and last as -1.\n\nLoop from left to right to find the first index where p[i} > p[i+1}.\n\nLoop from right to left to find the last index where p[j} < p[j-1}.\n\nCheck if swapping p[i} and p[j} results in a sorted array.\n\nAlternatively, check if the array has exactly two positions where p[i} > p[i+1}; if so, those two positions may be swapped.\n\nBut this is a standard problem. For example, in the array [1,3,2,4], the first and last such positions are i=1 and j=2. Swapping them sorts the array.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFind the first and last position where the array is not sorted. Swap those elements and check if the result is sorted.\n\nIf yes, then the maximum answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to find other swaps.\n\nBut how to implement this in O(n) time.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. Check if the array can be sorted with exactly one swap. If yes, return n.\n\n2. If not, find the best possible swap that adds the most good indices.\n\nBut how to implement step 1.\n\nHere's how to check if the array can be sorted with a single swap:\n\n- Find all the indices where p[i} != sorted_p[i}, where sorted_p is the sorted version of the array.\n\n- If there are exactly two such indices, and swapping those two in the original array results in the sorted array, then yes.\n\n- Otherwise, no.\n\nThis can be done in O(n) time.\n\nOnce we know that the array can be sorted with a single swap, then swapping those two elements gives f(p) =n, which is the maximum possible.\n\nIf not, then we have to find the next best option.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the array is already sorted. If it is, then we must swap any two elements, which will reduce the count to n-2.\n\nBut if the array is not sorted, but can be sorted with a single swap, then the answer is n.\n\nIf the array can't be sorted with a single swap, then we need to proceed to find the optimal swap.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial count of good indices.\n\n2. Check if the array can be sorted with one swap. If yes, return n.\n\n3. Else, find the swap that gives the maximum possible increase in good indices.\n\nBut how.\n\nAssuming that the array can't be sorted with a single swap, the maximum possible increase is 2, but only if there's a swap that adds two new good indices. Hence, the algorithm would check for such swaps.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute initial count.\n\n2. Check if array can be sorted with one swap. If yes, return n.\n\n3. Else, find all possible swaps that can add two new good indices.\n\n4. If any, return initial + 2.\n\n5. Else, find all possible swaps that add one good index.\n\n6. Return the maximum of initial + 1 or initial.\n\nBut how to check for these swaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible gain is 2, and if no such swap exists, the maximum gain is 1.\n\nBut if even the maximum gain is 0, then the answer is the initial count.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAt this point, given time constraints, perhaps the answer is that the maximum possible f(p) after one swap is either n (if the array can be sorted with one swap) or the initial count plus 0, 1, or 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, given the problem's time constraints, the optimal algorithm is likely O(n) time.\n\nSo, the solution steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the initial count of good indices.\n\n2. Check if the array is already sorted. If yes, then the maximum possible after swap is n-2.\n\n3. Else, check if the array can be sorted with one swap. If yes, return n.\n\n4. Else, check for swaps that can add two good indices.\n\n5. If found, return initial + 2.\n\n6. Else, check for swaps that can add one good index, and return initial + 1 or initial.\n\nBut how to implement steps 4 and 5.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the answer is to check for the swap that can sort the array, and if possible, return n. Otherwise, the maximum possible is initial + 2 if such a pair exists.\n\nBut how to check for such pairs.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible is the initial count plus 2, which can be achieved if there exists a pair (i, j) where swapping them creates two new good indices. If such a pair exists, then answer is initial + 2. Else, answer is initial plus the maximum possible gain (which might be 1).\n\nBut how to find if such a pair exists.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible swap, the change in the number of good indices is the sum of the changes at i and j. Other positions may be affected, but it's difficult to track. Hence, perhaps the optimal approach is to check all possible pairs (i, j) where the swap would create two new good indices, ignoring the effect on other positions. This could be done by checking the conditions for i and j in the swapped array.\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2) time.\n\nBut given that the initial count can be up to n (for a sorted array), but for a non-sorted array, the optimal answer may be found by considering a few cases.\n\nAfter trying to find a pattern, perhaps the maximum possible f(p) after exactly one swap is:\n\n- n if the array can be sorted with one swap.\n\n- Otherwise, the initial count plus 2 if there exists a pair (i, j) such that swapping them creates two new good indices.\n\n- Else, initial count plus 1 or initial.\n\nBut without knowing how to efficiently find such pairs, I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the correct answer for this problem is that the maximum possible f(p) after exactly one swap is either n (if the array can be sorted with one swap) or the initial count plus 2.\n\nBut how to confirm.\n\nIn the example [1,3,2,4], swapping 3 and 2 gives a sorted array, so answer is 4.\n\nIn the example [3,1,2], the array can be sorted by swapping 3 and 1, resulting in [1,3,2], which is not sorted. So no. So the answer is 1 (initial count was 0, and after swap, i=1 is good, so count is 1).\n\nBut in this case, there's no way to sort the array with one swap. Swapping 3 and 2 gives [2,1,3], which has one good index (i=3).\n\nSo in such cases, the answer depends on the initial count plus the maximum possible gain.\n\nThus, the optimal answer is:\n\nIf the array can be sorted with one swap: n.\n\nElse, compute the initial count and find the best possible swap.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal answer is to return the initial count plus 2 if there exists a swap that increases the count by 2, else initial count plus 1, else initial count.\n\nBut again, how to find this.\n\nGiven time constraints, I think the correct answer is that the maximum possible f(p) after one swap is n if the array can be sorted with a single swap. Otherwise, the maximum is the initial count plus 2 if two new good indices can be created, and so on.\n\nBut given the problem's constraints, the answer is likely n if sorted after a swap, else the Initial count plus 2, but how.\n\nBut without further analysis, I'm unable to proceed.\n\nAfter reviewing the problem again, I see that the initial count is computed based on the current p array. Then, the swap must be performed exactly once. The maximum possible f(p) after the swap is the answer.\n\nThe answer will depend on whether there's a swap that can create a sorted array (which gives n good indices), else look for the best possible pair.\n\nBut since the time constraints are tight, the only way to proceed is with an O(n) solution.\n\nThe key insight is that after a swap, the maximum possible good indices increase by 2 if the two swapped elements are the only ones not in their correct positions in the sorted array. Hence, the answer is n in such cases.\n\nOtherwise, the answer is the initial count plus 2 if there exists any pair (i, j) that can add two good indices, which is possible if the two elements fit the required ranges for each other's positions.\n\nBut without a way to compute this efficiently, I'll proceed to write the answer based on the initial analysis.",
