  "question": "Consider the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil. What is the minimal number of generators of its fundamental group?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the components here.\n\nFirst, the trefoil knot. I know that the trefoil is a non-trivial knot, specifically a (2,3)-torus knot. Its fundamental group is known to have a presentation with two generators and one relation, so normally the fundamental group of its complement in S^3 has two generators. But here, we're dealing with a twist-spun version of it in S^4, and then taking the double branched cover.\n\nTwist-spinning a knot is a process that turns a knot in S^3 into a 2-knot (a sphere) in S^4. The 5-twist-spun trefoil would be such a 2-knot. When you take the n-twist spin of a knot, the resulting 2-knot's complement has certain properties. The double branched cover of S^4 along this 2-knot might have a fundamental group related to the original knot's group, but modified by the twisting and the covering.\n\nNow, the double branched cover. For a manifold M branched over a codimension-2 submanifold N, the fundamental group of the cover can sometimes be computed using the fundamental group of the base and the monodromy around the branch locus. But in this case, the base is S^4, which is simply connected, so maybe the fundamental group of the branched cover is related to the monodromy action.\n\nSince the 2-knot is the twist-spun trefoil, the branch locus is this 2-knot. The fundamental group of the complement of a 2-knot in S^4 can be tricky. For a classical knot in S^3, the complement's fundamental group is non-trivial, but for a 2-knot in S^4, the complement is simply connected? Wait, isn't S^4 minus a smoothly embedded 2-sphere simply connected? If the 2-knot is a sphere, then maybe its complement is simply connected. If that's the case, then the double branched cover's fundamental group might be cyclic of order 2, but wait, the branch locus is the 2-knot, so maybe the fundamental group is related to the monodromy of the double cover.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to think about how the twist-spinning affects the monodromy. The n-twist spin operation creates a fibred 2-knot, where the fibre is the complement of the original knot, and the monodromy is the n-fold Dehn twist. For the trefoil knot, which is a fibre bundle with monodromy of order 6 (since it's a (2,3)-torus knot), so maybe the 5-twist would relate to that.\n\nWait, the trefoil's fibration has a monodromy of order 6. If we twist-spin it 5 times, does that affect the monodromy of the resulting 2-knot? Let me recall that the n-twist spin of a knot K produces a 2-knot whose complement fibers over S^1 with fibre the once-punctured complement of K, and the monodromy is the n-fold Dehn twist on the fibre. So for the trefoil, which has monodromy of order 6, doing a 5-twist might be equivalent to some power of the original monodromy.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this directly translates to the fundamental group of the double branched cover. Let's think about the double branched cover construction. If we have a double cover branched over a submanifold, then the fundamental group of the cover can be computed using the fundamental group of the base and the representation associated with the double cover. Since S^4 is simply connected, the fundamental group of the double branched cover should be generated by the elements that are lifted with relations coming from the branching. However, since the base is simply connected, the fundamental group of the cover might be cyclic of order 2, but that's only if the branch locus is non-singular and the monodromy around it is non-trivial. Wait, but S^4 is simply connected, so the monodromy around the branch locus (the 2-knot) must be an element of order 2 in the mapping class group of the fibre. But maybe this is overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fundamental group of the double branched cover over the 2-knot can be determined by considering the effect of the double cover on the knot group. For a classical knot, the double branched cover of S^3 along a knot has a fundamental group related to the knot's group modulo the square of the meridian. But in higher dimensions, for a 2-knot, things are different. However, 2-knots in S^4 can have different properties. Wait, if the 2-knot is a sphere, and the double branched cover is taken along it, then perhaps the fundamental group is either trivial or cyclic of order 2. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the double branched cover of S^4 along a twist-spun knot can be related to the double branched cover of the original knot in some way. For example, the twist-spun knot is constructed by spinning the original knot with a twist, so maybe the branched cover relates to the original knot's branched cover. The original trefoil's double branched cover is the lens space L(3,2). But here, we are dealing with a 2-knot in S^4.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The twist-spinning process for a knot K in S^3 results in a 2-knot in S^4, and the complement of the twist-spun knot is homeomorphic to the complement of K cross an interval, or something like that. But I might need to recall the structure of twist-spun knots. According to Zeeman's theorem, n-twist spinning a knot K produces a fibered 2-knot with fiber the punctured complement of K, and the monodromy is the n-fold Dehn twist along a meridian. So, for the 5-twist-spun trefoil, the monodromy is 5 Dehn twists. \n\nNow, if we take the double branched cover of S^4 along this 2-knot, the fundamental group might be related to the monodromy of the fibration. Since the base of the fibration is S^1 for the complement of the 2-knot, but the branched cover complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the fundamental group of the double cover is an extension of the fundamental group of the base by the fundamental group of the fibre, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the fundamental group of the complement of the 2-knot. Since the 2-knot is fibered, its complement is a mapping torus of the fiber with the monodromy map. The fiber here is the once-punctured trefoil complement. The trefoil complement has fundamental group with two generators (meridians) and the relation aba = bab. The once-punctured version would be similar, but maybe with an additional generator for the puncture? Wait, no, puncturing a 3-manifold doesn't add a generator to the fundamental group; instead, it kills a generator (since a small loop around the puncture becomes trivial). Wait, actually, no. If you have a 3-manifold with boundary, like the complement of a knot, which is a solid torus, then the fundamental group is the same as the knot group. If you puncture it (i.e., remove a point), the fundamental group remains the same because the 3-manifold is irreducible and the point can be pushed off. So perhaps the once-punctured trefoil complement has the same fundamental group as the trefoil, which is \u27e8a, b | aba = bab\u27e9.\n\nBut when you take the mapping torus with the monodromy being 5 Dehn twists along a meridian, how does that affect the fundamental group? The mapping torus's fundamental group is the fundamental group of the fiber, plus a new generator t that conjugates the elements according to the monodromy. So if the monodromy is a Dehn twist along a meridian, which in the trefoil's case, the meridian is one of the generators, say a. A Dehn twist along a would act on the fundamental group by sending b to a^{-1}ba, or something similar. Wait, the action of a Dehn twist on the fundamental group. For a Dehn twist along a curve \u03b3 in a surface, the induced automorphism on the fundamental group is conjugation by \u03b3 when you pass through the curve. But here, the fiber is not a surface but a 3-manifold with boundary. Hmm, maybe the Dehn twist here is a self-homeomorphism of the 3-manifold.\n\nIn the case of the trefoil complement, a meridian is a curve that bounds a disk intersecting the knot once. The Dehn twist along the meridian would be a self-homeomorphism of the knot complement. How does this act on the fundamental group? Let's say the fundamental group of the trefoil is \u27e8a, b | aba = bab\u27e9, where a and b are meridians around the two strands. A Dehn twist along the meridian a would likely send b to a^{-1}ba, similar to a surface Dehn twist. But since this is a 3-manifold, the action might differ. Alternatively, maybe the Dehn twist along a meridian can be realized as a twist in the S^1 direction when you do the mapping torus.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's consider that the 5-twist spin would result in the monodromy being the fifth power of the Dehn twist. If the original monodromy (for the trefoil) has order 6, then doing 5 twists would be equivalent to the inverse of a single twist. But I'm not sure how that affects the mapping torus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil is the trefoil group extended by an element t, with relations coming from the monodromy. Then, when we take the double branched cover, we might have to consider how the fundamental group is affected by the branching. Since S^4's fundamental group is trivial, the branched cover would have a fundamental group that's a quotient of the fundamental group of the complement, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle. The double branched cover of a 4-manifold over a smoothly embedded surface (the 2-knot) can sometimes be calculated using the Wirtinger presentation. But in higher dimensions, the Wirtinger presentation isn't straightforward. However, for a 2-knot, the fundamental group of the complement is known in some cases. If the complement of the 2-knot is simply connected, then the fundamental group of the branched cover might be cyclic of order 2. But I thought the complement of a 2-knot in S^4 is not necessarily simply connected. Wait, actually, for a 2-knot in S^4, the complement can have a non-trivial fundamental group. For example, spun knots can have their complements' fundamental groups related to the original knot group.\n\nWait, for a spun knot, which is constructed by spinning a 1-knot in S^3 around an axis to create a 2-knot in S^4, the complement's fundamental group is the same as the original knot group. But twist-spinning adds a twist, so maybe the fundamental group of the complement of the twist-spun knot is a cyclic extension of the original knot group. For example, the n-twist spun trefoil's complement has fundamental group \u27e8a, b, t | aba = bab, t a t^{-1} = a, t b t^{-1} = (a^{-1})^n b a^n\u27e9 or something like that.\n\nBut I need to get back to the double branched cover. If the fundamental group of the complement is the trefoil group plus some monodromy relation, then when we take the double branched cover, the fundamental group might be an extension of that by Z/2Z. But S^4 is simply connected, so the branched cover's fundamental group is generated by the loops that lift to nontrivial elements in the cover. Since the branch locus is a 2-knot, which is codimension 2, the monodromy around it is an element of order 2. So perhaps the fundamental group of the double cover is cyclic of order 2. But wait, if the original space is simply connected, and the cover is connected, then the fundamental group of the cover should be generated by the monodromy. But in a double cover, the fundamental group is either trivial or Z/2Z, depending on whether the monodromy is trivial or not. Since it's a nontrivial double cover, the monodromy is nontrivial, so the fundamental group should be Z/2Z. But that would mean the minimal number of generators is 1.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about specific examples. For example, the double branched cover of S^4 over the unknot (which is a trivial 2-knot) would be S^4 again, since branching over an unknotted sphere doesn't change the topology. Hence, the fundamental group is trivial. But if the 2-knot is non-trivial, then the double branched cover might have a non-trivial fundamental group.\n\nHowever, the 5-twist-spun trefoil is a non-trivial 2-knot. But do we know if its double branched cover has a fundamental group with one generator? Or maybe more?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the double branched cover of a twist-spun knot relates to the branched cover of the original knot. For example, the double branched cover of S^3 along the trefoil is the lens space L(3,1). If we twist-spin it, maybe the double branched cover over the 5-twist-spun trefoil is a 4-manifold whose fundamental group is related to L(3,1). Wait, but L(3,1) is a 3-manifold. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the double branched cover's fundamental group is a cyclic group of order 2. Because when you take a double cover, the fundamental group can be an extension of the base's group by Z/2Z. But the base is S^4, which is simply connected, so the fundamental group of the cover should be Z/2Z. Therefore, the minimal number of generators is 1.\n\nBut I need to confirm this. In a double branched cover, if the branch locus is a codimension 2 submanifold and the base is simply connected, then the fundamental group of the cover is cyclic of order 2 if the monodromy around the branch locus is non-trivial. Since it's a double cover, the monodromy is indeed non-trivial (order 2), so the fundamental group should be Z/2Z, generated by a single element. Therefore, the minimal number of generators is 1.\n\nBut wait, in the case of 4-manifolds, could there be more complexities? For example, maybe the branched cover has a non-cyclic fundamental group. Wait, but since the base is S^4, any loop in the cover can be projected to a loop in S^4, which is contractible, so the loop must be in the branch locus's monodromy. Hence, the fundamental group is generated by the loop around the branch locus, which has order 2. So the fundamental group is Z/2Z, requiring only one generator. Thus, the minimal number of generators is 1.\n\nI think that makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be 1 with high confidence.\n",
