  "question": "Whats the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ ($T^2$ is the $2$-torus). ",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the minimal number of critical points a smooth function from the 2-torus to the real numbers must have. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. The 2-torus, T\u00b2, is a compact smooth manifold without boundary. Critical points of a function are points where the derivative is zero. \n\nI remember from Morse theory that for a smooth function on a manifold, the number of critical points is related to the topology of the manifold. Morse inequalities give a lower bound based on the Betti numbers. But wait, the question isn't specifically about Morse functions, just any smooth function. However, maybe the minimal number is achieved by a Morse function, so perhaps thinking in terms of Morse theory is still useful.\n\nFor a torus T\u00b2, the Betti numbers are b\u2080=1, b\u2081=2, b\u2082=1. The Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index k must be at least b_k for each k. If we use a Morse function, the minimal number would then be the sum of the Betti numbers, which is 1+2+1=4. But wait, that would be the case for a perfect Morse function where the inequalities become equalities. So maybe the minimal number is 4?\n\nBut hold on, the question is about any smooth function, not necessarily Morse. However, I also recall that the minimal number of critical points for a function on a manifold is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category plus 1. The LS category of the torus is 3, so that would suggest at least 3+1=4 critical points. Hmm, that's consistent with the Morse theory approach. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is the minimal number of open sets needed to cover the manifold, each contractible in the manifold. For the torus, it's 3. So the LS category is 3, and the critical points are at least cat(M)+1, so 3+1=4. So that also points to 4. \n\nBut wait, I need to confirm that. Let me think again. Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem states that any smooth function on a manifold M has at least cat(M)+1 critical points. If cat(T\u00b2)=3, then that would be 4. But is that correct? Wait, actually, for the 2-torus, the LS category is 3. Because you can't cover it with two contractible open sets, but three is possible. So yes, cat(T\u00b2)=3. Therefore, the minimal number would be 4.\n\nBut then I remember that the torus can have functions with fewer critical points. Wait, no. For example, the standard height function on the torus (like the donut standing upright) has four critical points: a maximum, a minimum, and two saddle points. That's a Morse function with four critical points. But can there be a non-Morse function with fewer?\n\nIf a function is not Morse, some critical points might be degenerate. For example, maybe two saddle points could merge into a single degenerate critical point. But would that reduce the total number? Let's say we have a function with a minimum, a maximum, and a single degenerate saddle. Then total critical points would be three. But does such a function exist?\n\nBut the LS theorem gives a lower bound regardless of whether the function is Morse or not. So if LS says at least 4, then that's the answer. But wait, maybe I messed up the LS category. Let me check. Some sources say the LS category of the torus is 2. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me think again. For the 2-sphere, LS category is 2. For the torus, how is it calculated?\n\nThe LS category is the minimal number of open sets, contractible in the space, needed to cover the space. For the circle S\u00b9, cat(S\u00b9)=2. For the torus T\u00b2=S\u00b9\u00d7S\u00b9, the LS category is 3. Because you need three sets: take two sets to cover each S\u00b9 direction, but their intersection would be the product of intervals, but maybe not contractible. Wait, actually, the product of two circles can be covered by three sets: two that cover \"along\" one circle and one that covers the remaining part. I think cat(T\u00b2)=3. Then according to LS theorem, any smooth function on T\u00b2 has at least 3+1=4 critical points. So that would imply that the minimal number is 4.\n\nBut then the standard Morse function on the torus (like the height function) has exactly 4 critical points: min, max, and two saddles. So that would be the minimal, matching LS bound. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut wait, I also recall that for surfaces, the minimal number of critical points is related to the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic of the torus is 0. The relation for Morse functions is that the alternating sum of the number of critical points equals the Euler characteristic. For a torus, with a Morse function, we have c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = 0. Here c_0 is the number of minima, c_1 the saddles, c_2 the maxima. For the standard height function, 1 min, 2 saddles, 1 max, so 1 -2 +1=0, which matches. But if there's a non-Morse function, perhaps with a degenerate critical point, how does that affect?\n\nBut the question is about the minimal number, regardless of whether the function is Morse. The LS bound is a lower bound that applies to any smooth function. So if LS says 4, then that's the answer. But I need to make sure that the LS category of the torus is indeed 3. Let me confirm quickly. For example, on Wikipedia, the Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann category of the torus T^n is n+1. Wait, that can't be right. For T\u00b2, n=2, so LS category would be 3? Wait, the source says for the n-torus T^n, cat(T^n)=n+1. So for T\u00b2, it's 3, which would mean the minimal critical points are 4. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of critical points is 4. But wait, another thought: suppose there's a function with fewer critical points by having a monkey saddle or some higher multiplicity critical points. But LS doesn't care about the nature of the critical points, just their number. So even if a critical point is degenerate, it still counts as one. So if LS says at least 4, then any function must have at least 4. Hence, the minimal is 4.\n\nBut I also remember that for compact manifolds, there must be at least a minimum and a maximum. So that's two critical points. But then, on the torus, can you have a function with only two critical points? For example, a function with just a max and a min. But the torus is not homeomorphic to a sphere, so maybe such a function isn't possible. Wait, on the torus, can there be a function with only two critical points? Let's see. If you imagine a torus, if you have a function that has a maximum and a minimum, but no other critical points, would that be possible? The problem is that the torus has genus 1, so its topology is different from a sphere. \n\nIf such a function existed, its gradient would flow from the minimum to the maximum everywhere else, but the torus has \"holes\". I think that would require some saddle points. For example, on the sphere, the standard height function has two critical points (max and min), but the sphere is simply connected. On the torus, which is not simply connected, you can't have such a function. The minimal critical points would include saddles. \n\nAlternatively, using Morse theory: For a function on the torus, the minimal number of critical points is 4. Because the Morse inequalities require at least one critical point of index 0 (minimum), two of index 1 (because b\u2081=2), and one of index 2 (maximum). So total of 4. Therefore, even a Morse function requires 4. And since LS says that any smooth function must have at least 4, then 4 is the minimal. \n\nThus, the answer should be 4.\n",
