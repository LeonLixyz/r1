  "question": "What is the smallest integer n such that the sum of the first n prime numbers exceeds 10^6 ?\n\n",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest integer n such that the sum of the first n prime numbers is greater than 10^6. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, 10^6 is 1,000,000. The question is asking for the smallest n where the sum of the first n primes crosses this threshold. So, I need to add primes one by one until their sum is just over a million. Then the value of n at that point is the answer.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this without having to check every prime individually? Because primes can be large, and calculating them all up to that point might take a while. But maybe there's a pattern or a formula to estimate? Wait, I don't think there's a straightforward formula for the sum of the first n primes. The primes themselves are kind of unpredictable in their distribution. So, maybe the only way is to actually generate the primes sequentially and keep a running total until the sum exceeds 1,000,000.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Generate primes in order (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)\n2. Keep a running sum of these primes.\n3. After adding each prime, check if the sum exceeds 1,000,000.\n4. The count of primes added at that point is the desired n.\n\nNow, the challenge is generating the primes efficiently. Let's think about how to generate primes. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is good for generating all primes up to a certain limit, but here we need primes sequentially until the sum crosses 1e6. The sieve might not be the best if we don't know the upper limit. Alternatively, we can check each number for primality as we go, adding them to the list if they are prime, until the sum is enough.\n\nBut how high will the primes go? Let's do a rough estimate. The sum of the first n primes grows roughly like (n^2) * log n, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe approximate using the prime number theorem. The nth prime is approximately n log n. So the sum would be roughly the integral from 1 to n of x log x dx. Wait, but this is just an approximation, so maybe not the best way.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum of the first n primes is around 1e6, we can approximate the average prime in the first n primes. Let's say the average is about (1e6)/n. But the average of the first n primes is roughly (n log n)/2, since the nth prime is about n log n. Wait, maybe not. The sum of the first n primes is approximately (n^2)(log n)/2. So (n^2)(log n)/2 \u2248 1e6. Solving for n here would give an approximate value. Let's try that.\n\nLet\u2019s set (n\u00b2 log n)/2 \u2248 1e6. Then n\u00b2 log n \u2248 2e6. Let's make a guess. Let's try n=500. Then 500\u00b2 is 250,000. log 500 is about log(500)=ln(500) \u2248 6.21 (since ln(100)=4.605, ln(e^6)=6, so 500 is e^6.21...). So 250,000 * 6.21 \u2248 1,552,500, which is larger than 2e6. Wait, but wait, 2e6 is 2,000,000. Wait, no. Wait, wait, (n^2 log n)/2 \u22481e6 => n^2 log n \u22482e6. So 500\u00b2 log 500 \u2248250,000 *6.21\u2248 1,552,500 which is less than 2e6. So n=500 gives 1.55e6, which is under 2e6. Let's try n=600. 600\u00b2=360,000. log(600)=ln(600)\u22486.4. 360,000*6.4=2,304,000. That's more than 2e6. So n is between 500 and 600. Wait, but this is the approximate equation. So solving n\u00b2 log n \u22482e6. Let's try n=550. 550\u00b2=302,500. log(550)=ln(550)\u22486.31. 302,500 *6.31\u2248 302,500*6=1,815,000 plus 302,500*0.31\u224893,775. Total\u22481,908,775. Still under 2e6. Next, n=570. 570\u00b2=324,900. ln(570)\u22486.345. 324,900 *6.345\u2248324,900*6=1,949,400 and 324,900*0.345\u2248112,090.5. Total\u22482,061,490.5. That's over 2e6. So around 560?\n\nWait, this is getting tedious. Alternatively, perhaps n is roughly 550? But this is just an approximation, so maybe the actual required n is around 550 primes. But this is an approximation. The actual value might differ. But maybe this gives a ballpark. However, the problem is that the sum of primes is actually higher than the approximation because the approximation is based on the prime number theorem, and the actual primes grow a bit faster. So maybe the actual n is less than 550. But this is just a rough estimate. The only way to know is to compute the sum step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of primes being around n log n, the sum of the first n primes is roughly (n^2 log n)/2. But perhaps this isn't accurate. Wait, let me check some actual data. For example, the sum of the first 100 primes. Let's see, the 100th prime is 541. The sum can be found in tables. But I don't remember offhand. Alternatively, let's take a smaller n. For n=10, the 10th prime is 29. The sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29=129. The formula (10\u00b2 log 10)/2 = 100 *2.302/2\u2248115.1. So 129 vs 115.1. So the actual sum is higher. So maybe the formula underestimates. So perhaps the actual sum is larger, meaning that the required n might be lower than the approximation. So perhaps for n=500, the sum would be higher than the formula suggests, so maybe even n=500 would have sum over 1e6. Wait, but according to the formula, (500^2 * ln 500)/2 \u2248 (250,000 * 6.2146)/2 \u2248250,000 *3.107\u2248776,750. So according to formula, sum is about 776,750, but actual sum is higher. Let's check actual data: the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913 (I remember this from previous problems). Wait, 3.68 million. So 1000 primes sum to 3.68 million. So 1 million would require less than 1000 primes. But when exactly? Let's see: The sum of the first 500 primes. Let's see, maybe around 500 primes? For example, the sum of the first 100 primes is 24133 (I might be wrong, but perhaps). Let me check via a quick calculation. Let me list first 10 primes and their sum: 2+3=5, +5=10, +7=17, +11=28, +13=41, +17=58, +19=77, +23=100, +29=129. So sum of first 10 is 129. Then, let's say sum of first 100 primes. According to some references, the sum of the first 100 primes is 24133. So that's about 24,133. Then the sum of first 1000 primes is 3,682,913. So, if the sum at 1000 is ~3.68 million, which is over 1e6. But where does it cross 1e6? Let's see, maybe around 750 primes? Let's try to estimate. Suppose sum grows roughly quadratically. From 100 to 1000 primes, sum increases from ~24k to ~3.68 million, which is a factor of ~152. The number of primes increases by 9x, sum by 152x. So maybe sum is proportional to n\u00b2. So if sum at n=500 is approx (sum at 1000) multiplied by (500/1000)^2, which would be 3.68 million /4 = 920,000. So sum of first 500 primes is around 920,000. But 920k is still less than 1e6. Then sum at 550 primes would be (550/1000)^2 *3.68 million= (0.55)^2=0.3025*3.68 million=1.113 million. So sum of first 550 primes is approximately 1.1 million, which exceeds 1e6. Therefore, the answer is around 550. But this is a rough approximation. But since the actual sum of first 500 primes is higher than 920k (since the formula under-estimates), maybe even n=500 might get close. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I need to look up a list of the sums of primes. But since I can't do that, I need to figure out the actual approach.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the primes in order, keep adding them until the sum exceeds 1e6. So let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize sum = 0, count = 0.\n2. Generate the next prime number.\n3. Add it to the sum, increment count by 1.\n4. Check if sum > 1e6. If yes, return count. Else, repeat.\n\nThe problem now is generating primes efficiently. Let's think about how to generate primes one by one. For each candidate number, check if it's prime. Since primes can get large, but in this case, since the sum needs to exceed 1e6, the primes involved are up to maybe a few thousand? Let's see, if the sum is 1e6, and the average prime in the list is about 1e6 /n. Suppose n is around 500, so average prime is 2000. So primes up to maybe 2000. So checking primes up to that using trial division might be feasible, even if a bit slow.\n\nWait, but even for primes up to, say, 10,000, trial division is manageable for a computer but maybe time-consuming for a human. However, in the context of this question, perhaps I can proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, use a list of primes. But perhaps the answer is known from existing resources. Wait, for example, the sum of the first 168 primes is 77,274. That's way below 1e6. The sum of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913. So between 168 and 1000. To find the exact n, we need to find when the sum crosses 1e6.\n\nWait, but perhaps the exact sum of primes up to a certain count can be looked up. But since I can't access external resources, I need to estimate or find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a known approximation. Wait, according to the sum of the first n primes, there's an approximate formula which is (n^2)(log n)/2. But this is an approximation. Let's try to use that.\n\nWe need (n^2)(log n)/2 > 1e6 => n^2 log n > 2e6.\n\nLet's plug in n=500: 500^2 * log(500) = 250,000 * 6.2146 \u2248 1,553,650. Which is less than 2e6. So 500^2 log n would be 1.55 million, which is under 2e6. So n=500 gives sum ~776k (1.55m/2). Not enough. For n=600: 600^2 * log(600). 600^2=360,000. log(600)=6.3969. So 360,000 *6.3969\u22482,302,884. So 2,302,884 /2 \u22481,151,442. So the approximate sum would be ~1.15 million. So this is over 1e6. So according to the approximation, the n is around 600. But since the actual sum is higher, maybe the actual n is around 550 or 500. Hmm. But again, this is an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a list or code to compute. Since I can't code here, but I can try to compute the sum step by step manually for a few primes to get an idea.\n\nBut that would take too long. Maybe think of an alternative approach. Let's consider that the sum of the first n primes is known to cross 1e6 at n=???\n\nWait, maybe I can recall from previous knowledge. For example, the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913. So the sum of the first 750 primes would be approximately 3.68 million * (750/1000)^2 = 3.68 million * 0.5625 \u2248 2.07 million. But that's still over a million. So even 750 primes give over 2 million sum. That's not possible. Wait, this approach is flawed. Wait, if sum is proportional to n\u00b2, then scaling would be as such. But given that the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3.68 million, that would suggest that sum(n) grows faster than n\u00b2. Because the first 100 primes sum to 24k, which is (100)^2=10,000, but actual sum is 24k, which is higher. So maybe sum(n) is roughly proportional to n^2. Then, for sum(n)=1e6, n would be sqrt(1e6 / (3.68e6)) *1000. Wait, but that's sqrt(1e6/3.68e6)\u2248sqrt(0.2717)\u22480.521. So 0.521*1000\u2248521. So n\u2248521. But this is a rough estimate. However, given that the sum of the first 521 primes would be around 3.68e6 * (521/1000)^2 \u22483.68e6 *0.271\u22481 million. So maybe around 521. So, perhaps the answer is around 550 or 520 primes.\n\nBut in reality, the sum of the first n primes is not exactly following a perfect n\u00b2 relation, but this gives an idea.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the answer in known mathematical references, but since I can't, I have to proceed logically.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in the problem where the sum of the first n primes exceeds 1000, the answer is n=17. Because sum first 17 primes is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29+31+37+41+43+47+53+59= 440 (wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I should calculate that again: 2,3,5,7,11 sum to 28. Then next primes:13 (sum 41), 17 (58), 19 (77), 23 (100), 29 (129), 31 (160), 37 (197), 41 (238), 43 (281), 47 (328), 53 (381), 59 (440), 61 (501), 67 (568), 71 (639), 73 (712), 79 (791), 83 (874), 89 (963), 97 (1060). So the sum first 21 primes is 1060. So the answer for sum over 1000 is n=21. That's just to check. But in that case, the sum grows to 1060 at n=21. So for 1e6, a much larger n is required.\n\nBut how to proceed? Let's think of the prime generating process. Let's list the primes and add them step by step. But since this would take a lot of time, perhaps think of a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the following code logic:\n\nInitialize sum = 0, count = 0, current_number = 2.\n\nWhile sum <= 1e6:\n\n    if current_number is prime:\n\n        sum += current_number\n\n        count +=1\n\n    current_number +=1\n\nOnce the sum exceeds 1e6, return count.\n\nBut how to check for primes efficiently?\n\nFor each current_number, check divisibility up to sqrt(current_number). For example, for 2, it's prime. Add to sum. Then 3, prime. Add. Then 4, not prime. Then 5, prime. Add. Continue.\n\nBut this is time-consuming manually, but perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, estimate the number of primes needed. Let's assume the primes are approximately of the order of n log n. So sum would be roughly the sum of the first n primes, which is roughly n^2 log n /2.\n\nSet that equal to 1e6:\n\nn^2 log n /2 = 1e6\n\nn^2 log n = 2e6\n\nLet's try to approximate n.\n\nLet's take logarithms.\n\nLet\u2019s take natural logs:\n\nln(n^2 log n) = ln(2e6)\n\nln(n^2) + ln(log n) = ln(2e6)\n\n2 ln n + ln(log n) = ln(2e6)\n\nln(2e6) \u2248 ln(2) + ln(1e6) \u2248 0.693 + 13.8155 \u224814.5085.\n\nSo 2 ln n + ln(ln n) =14.5085.\n\nThis is a transcendental equation. Maybe use iterative methods.\n\nLet\u2019s guess n=500:\n\nln(500)=6.2146, 2*6.2146=12.429, ln(6.2146)=1.827. Sum=12.429+1.827\u224814.256, which is close to 14.5085. Need a bit higher.\n\nNext guess n=550:\n\nln(550)=6.3099. 2*6.3099=12.6198. ln(6.3099)=1.842. Sum\u224812.6198+1.842\u224814.4618. Still less than 14.5085. Next, n=560.\n\nln(560)=6.3279. 2*6.3279\u224812.6558. ln(6.3279)=1.845. Sum\u224812.6558+1.845\u224814.5008. Very close to 14.5085. So n\u2248560. So according to this approximation, n\u2248560.\n\nBut since the actual sum of the first n primes is higher than the approximation (as earlier examples showed), maybe the actual n is lower than this. For example, the approximation gives sum\u2248(560^2 * log 560)/2 \u2248 (313600 *6.3279)/2 \u2248 (313600 *3.16395)\u2248992,000. Which is close to 1e6. But the actual sum is higher. So maybe the actual sum would exceed 1e6 around n=560.\n\nBut how to get the exact value? Well, the answer probably requires knowing the exact sum, which would be a known value. Since I can't compute it manually here, I need to recall or find the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 568. Wait, but I need to check. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 1000. No, because the sum of first 1000 primes is 3.68 million. That's way over.\n\nAlternatively, think of cumulative prime sums. For example, according to the OEIS sequence A007504, which lists the sum of the first n primes.\n\nLooking up A007504, the sum of the first n primes:\n\nFor example:\n\nn=1: 2\n\nn=2:5\n\nn=3:10\n\nn=4:17\n\nn=5:28\n\n... and so on.\n\nBut we need to go up until the sum exceeds 1e6. Since I can't look this up now, I need to proceed via reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the OEIS sequence, the sum for n=1000 is 3,682,913 as mentioned earlier. Let's check for n=500. If the sum for n=500 is around 1,555,050 (as per the approximation), but actual sum would be higher. Suppose the real sum for n=500 is 1.6 million. Then the answer would be around 500. But if the actual sum is lower, say 800,000, then n would need to be higher.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the sum of the first 550 primes. If the sum of the first 550 primes is approximately 1.1 million (based on the approximation), then the answer is 550. But the exact value requires knowing the actual sum.\n\nBut since I can't compute this manually, perhaps the answer is 568. Wait, why 568? Because if each prime averages around 2000, then 568 primes would sum to about 1,136,000. Which is over 1e6. But the average isn't that high. The first few primes are small, so the average is lower. For example, the first 100 primes have an average of 24,133/100\u2248241. Then the average increases as n increases. The 1000th prime is 7919. So the average of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913 /1000 \u22483683. So for n=1000, average is ~3683. So for n=568, the average might be around 1800. So sum=568*1800\u22481,022,400. So that's over 1e6. So perhaps n is around 568. But I need to check the exact sum.\n\nAlternatively, I found that the sum of the first 758 primes is 1,034,074. So if that's the case, then the answer would be 758. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 168. But the sum of the first 168 primes is 77,274, which is way too low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1060. But I have no idea. This is getting frustrating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 568, 550, or something similar, but I need to be precise.\n\nWait, let's think of another approach. Let's consider that the sum of primes up to some number x is approximately equal to the integral of the prime density function from 2 to x. But integrating this would be complex. Alternatively, using the approximation that the sum of primes less than or equal to x is approximately (x^2)/(2 log x). So solving (x^2)/(2 log x) \u22481e6. Then x^2 \u22482e6 log x. But this seems similar to the previous equation but in terms of x instead of n.\n\nBut perhaps using the approximation that the nth prime is roughly n log n. Let's suppose that the nth prime is approximately n log n. Then the sum of the first n primes would be approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k log k. But the sum of k log k from 1 to n is roughly (n\u00b2 log n)/2 - n\u00b2/(4 ln 2) (from some integral approximation). But this might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate the sum as integral from 1 to n of x log x dx. The integral of x log x dx is (x\u00b2/2)(log x - 1/2). Let's compute this from 1 to n:\n\nIntegral \u2248 (n\u00b2/2)(log n - 0.5) - (1^2/2)(log 1 -0.5) = (n\u00b2/2)(log n -0.5) -0, since log 1=0.\n\nSo setting this equal to 1e6:\n\n(n\u00b2/2)(log n -0.5) \u22481e6.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nn\u00b2 (log n -0.5) \u22482e6.\n\nNow, solving for n. Let's make an initial guess n=500.\n\nlog n = ln(500)\u22486.2146.\n\nlog n -0.5=5.7146.\n\nn\u00b2=250,000. 250,000 *5.7146\u22481,428,650. Which is less than 2e6.\n\nn=600: log n=6.3969, log n -0.5=5.8969. n\u00b2=360,000. 360,000*5.8969\u22482,122,884. Which is over 2e6. So between 500 and 600.\n\nLet's find n where n\u00b2 (log n -0.5)=2e6.\n\nTry n=550:\n\nlog n\u22486.309, log n -0.5\u22485.809. n\u00b2=302,500. 302,500 *5.809\u2248302,500 *5=1,512,500 plus 302,500*0.809\u2248244,  many, approximate total 1,512,500 +244, 1,756,500. Still under 2e6.\n\nn=580: log n=6.363, log n -0.5=5.863. n\u00b2=580^2=336,400. 336,400 *5.863\u2248336,400*5=1,682,000 +336,400*0.863\u2248290,000. Total\u22481,682,000 +290,000=1,972,000. Close to 2e6.\n\nn=590: log n\u22486.38, log n-0.5=5.88. n\u00b2=348,100. 348,100 *5.88\u2248348,100*5=1,740,500 +348,100*0.88\u2248306, 328. Total\u22481,740,500 +306,328=2,046,828. Over 2e6. So n between 580 and 590.\n\nAt n=585: log n\u22486.37, log n-0.5=5.87. n\u00b2=585^2=342,225. 342,225*5.87\u2248342,225*5=1,711,125 +342,225*0.87\u2248297, 736. Total\u22481,711,125 +297,736=2,008,861. Close to 2e6.\n\nSo n\u2248585 gives integral\u22482,008,861, which is just over 2e6. So sum of primes is approximately (n\u00b2/2)(log n -0.5) \u22481,004,430. Which is over 1e6. So according to this approximation, the answer is around 585. But considering that the actual sum is higher than the approximation, the actual n would be lower. Hmmm. For example, if the approximation is 1,004,430 for n=585, but actual sum is higher, then the actual sum might cross 1e6 at a lower n. So perhaps n=550?\n\nBut this is all estimation. Without actual data, it's difficult to give an exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall from previous knowledge that the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913. Then, if we interpolate between known sums, but I don't have such data. Alternatively, I can think of a different approach. For example, if the sum of the first n primes is approximately (n^2) * (log n)/2, then set this equal to 1e6 and solve for n. Let's try that again.\n\n(n\u00b2 log n)/2 =1e6 \u2192 n\u00b2 log n=2e6.\n\nTrial:\n\nn=500: 500\u00b2=250k *6.214\u22481,553,500. Which is less than 2e6.\n\nn=550:550\u00b2=302,500 * log(550)=6.309 \u2192 302,500*6.309\u22481,907,  the product is 302,500*6=1,815,000 and 302,500*0.309\u224893,  so total\u22481,815,000+93,000=1,908,000. Still under 2e6.\n\nn=570:570\u00b2=324,900. log570\u22486.3456. Multiply:324,900*6.3456\u2248324,900*6=1,949,400 +324,900*0.3456\u2248 324,900*0.3=97,470 and 324,900*0.0456\u224814,800. Total\u22481,949,400+97,470+14,800\u22482,061,670. Which is over 2e6.\n\nSo with n=570, we have n\u00b2 log n\u22482,061,670, which is over 2e6. So according to the approximation, the sum is 2,061,670/2=1,030,835. So the approximate sum is 1.03 million. So the actual sum would be higher, so the actual sum would cross 1e6 at an n slightly lower than 570. Let's see for n=560:\n\nn=560, log n\u22486.327. n\u00b2=313,600. 313,600*6.327\u2248313,600*6=1,881,600 +313,600*0.327\u2248102,547. Total\u22481,984,147. So sum\u22481,984,147/2=992,073. Under 1e6. So n=560 yields approx 992k. n=565:\n\nn=565: log n\u22486.337. n\u00b2=565\u00b2=319,225. 319,225*6.337\u2248319,225*6=1,915,350 +319,225*0.337\u2248107,  then total\u22482,022, 350. Sum\u22481,011,175. Over 1e6. So according to this approximation, n=565 gives sum\u22481.01 million. So the answer is approximately 565.\n\nBut since the actual sum is higher than the approximation, the actual n would be less than 565. So perhaps around 550-560.\n\nBut since I can't compute this exactly, how to proceed? The answer is likely 568, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's 550. But without exact data, I can't be certain. \n\nWait, I remember that the sum of the first 550 primes is approximately 1,011,000. If that's the case, then the answer is 550. However, I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 568. Because if each prime from 550 to 568 adds about 2000 on average, then 18 primes would add 36,000, which would push the sum from 992k (at 560) to 1,028k, which exceeds 1e6. But this is very approximate.\n\nGiven that without exact data, the best approach is to use the approximation and adjust based on the knowledge that the actual sum is higher. So the approximation suggests n=565 gives sum ~1,011,000, but actual sum would be higher, so maybe the actual n is around 550-560. However, since the problem asks for the exact answer, which is a specific integer, I must either know it or have a way to compute it.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, I might have to accept that the answer is 568. Alternatively, check how the sum of primes progresses.\n\nWait, let's take a different approach. Let's consider that the sum of the first n primes is roughly proportional to n^2 log n. To reach 1e6, solve n^2 log n \u22482e6. Assume that log is natural log.\n\nWe can use iterative guesses. Let's try n=500:\n\n500\u00b2*log(500)=250,000 *6.214\u22481,553,500 <2e6.\n\nn=550:550\u00b2*log(550)=302,500 *6.309\u2248302,500*6=1,815,000 +302,500*0.309\u224893,  so\u22481,908,000 <2e6.\n\nn=570:570\u00b2*log(570)=324,900 *6.345\u2248324,900 *6=1,949,400 +324,900*0.345\u2248112,  total\u22482,061,400 >2e6.\n\nSo between 550 and 570.\n\nLet's find where 324,900*n\u22482e6 at n=570. Let's see n=560:\n\n560\u00b2=313,600. log(560)\u22486.327.\n\n313,600*6.327\u2248313,600*6=1,881,600 +313,600*0.327\u2248102,  total\u22481,983,600.\n\nTo reach 2e6, need 16,400 more. Each additional n adds (2n+1) log (n+1) + (n+1)^2 * derivative of log(n). Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for each increment in n from 560 to 570:\n\nAt n=560: 1,983,600.\n\nEach additional prime adds approximately (2n+1) log n +n\u00b2*(1/n) (from derivative). Not sure. Maybe approximate the increase per n.\n\nAlternatively, assume that for each increase in n by 1, the term n\u00b2 log n increases by roughly (n+1)^2 log(n+1) -n\u00b2 log n.\n\nFor n=560, that's 561\u00b2 log561 -560\u00b2 log560.\n\nCompute this:\n\n561\u00b2=314,721. log561\u22486.329.\n\n560\u00b2=313,600. log560\u22486.327.\n\n314,721*6.329 \u2248314,721*6=1,888,326 +314,721*0.329\u2248103,  total\u22481,888,326+103,000\u22481,991,326.\n\nPrevious n=560: 313,600*6.327\u22481,983,600.\n\nSo the increase is 1,991,326 -1,983,600\u22487,726 per n=1. So to reach 2e6 from 1,983,600, need delta of 16,400. How many steps? 16,400 /7,726\u22482.12. So approximately 2 more n steps. So at n=562, the value would be approximately 1,983,600 +7,726*2\u22481,983,600 +15,452\u22481,999,052. Still under. Next step at n=563: +7,726\u22482,006,778. So for n=563, the term n\u00b2 log n\u22482,006,778, which exceeds 2e6.\n\nThus, according to this approximation, n=563 would yield sum\u22482.006e6 /2=1.003e6. So the sum exceeds 1e6 at n=563. Thus, the answer would be 563. But again, this is an approximation, and the actual sum may differ. Therefore, the answer is approximately 563.\n\nBut since the problem requires an exact answer, I must choose the closest option. However, since I don't have exact data, I can't be sure. But given the approximations, the answer is likely around 563. However, in actuality, the sum of the first n primes may require a different n. For example, the actual sum might exceed 1e6 at n=568.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall from previous knowledge that the correct answer is 568. But I'm not 100% certain. However, based on the approximation and the thought process, I'll go with 568 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the sum of the first \\( n \\) primes exceeds \\( 10^6 \\), we approximate the growth of the sum of primes.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest integer n such that the sum of the first n prime numbers is greater than 10^6. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, 10^6 is 1,000,000. The question is asking for the smallest n where the sum of the first n primes crosses this threshold. So, I need to add primes one by one until their sum is just over a million. Then the value of n at that point is the answer.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this without having to check every prime individually? Because primes can be large, and calculating them all up to that point might take a while. But maybe there's a pattern or a formula to estimate? Wait, I don't think there's a straightforward formula for the sum of the first n primes. The primes themselves are kind of unpredictable in their distribution. So, maybe the only way is to actually generate the primes sequentially and keep a running total until the sum exceeds 1,000,000.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Generate primes in order (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)\n2. Keep a running sum of these primes.\n3. After adding each prime, check if the sum exceeds 1,000,000.\n4. The count of primes added at that point is the desired n.\n\nNow, the challenge is generating the primes efficiently. Let's think about how to generate primes. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is good for generating all primes up to a certain limit, but here we need primes sequentially until the sum crosses 1e6. The sieve might not be the best if we don't know the upper limit. Alternatively, we can check each number for primality as we go, adding them to the list if they are prime, until the sum is enough.\n\nBut how high will the primes go? Let's do a rough estimate. The sum of the first n primes grows roughly like (n^2) * log n, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe approximate using the prime number theorem. The nth prime is approximately n log n. So the sum would be roughly the integral from 1 to n of x log x dx. Wait, but this is just an approximation, so maybe not the best way.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum of the first n primes is around 1e6, we can approximate the average prime in the first n primes. Let's say the average is about (1e6)/n. But the average of the first n primes is roughly (n log n)/2, since the nth prime is about n log n. Wait, maybe not. The sum of the first n primes is approximately (n^2)(log n)/2. So (n^2)(log n)/2 \u2248 1e6. Solving for n here would give an approximate value. Let's try that.\n\nLet\u2019s set (n\u00b2 log n)/2 \u2248 1e6. Then n\u00b2 log n \u2248 2e6. Let's make a guess. Let's try n=500. Then 500\u00b2 is 250,000. log 500 is about log(500)=ln(500) \u2248 6.21 (since ln(100)=4.605, ln(e^6)=6, so 500 is e^6.21...). So 250,000 * 6.21 \u2248 1,552,500, which is larger than 2e6. Wait, but wait, 2e6 is 2,000,000. Wait, no. Wait, wait, (n^2 log n)/2 \u22481e6 => n^2 log n \u22482e6. So 500\u00b2 log 500 \u2248250,000 *6.21\u2248 1,552,500 which is less than 2e6. So n=500 gives 1.55e6, which is under 2e6. Let's try n=600. 600\u00b2=360,000. log(600)=ln(600)\u22486.4. 360,000*6.4=2,304,000. That's more than 2e6. So n is between 500 and 600. Wait, but this is the approximate equation. So solving n\u00b2 log n \u22482e6. Let's try n=550. 550\u00b2=302,500. log(550)=ln(550)\u22486.31. 302,500 *6.31\u2248 302,500*6=1,815,000 plus 302,500*0.31\u224893,775. Total\u22481,908,775. Still under 2e6. Next, n=570. 570\u00b2=324,900. ln(570)\u22486.345. 324,900 *6.345\u2248324,900*6=1,949,400 and 324,900*0.345\u2248112,090.5. Total\u22482,061,490.5. That's over 2e6. So around 560?\n\nWait, this is getting tedious. Alternatively, perhaps n is roughly 550? But this is just an approximation, so maybe the actual required n is around 550 primes. But this is an approximation. The actual value might differ. But maybe this gives a ballpark. However, the problem is that the sum of primes is actually higher than the approximation because the approximation is based on the prime number theorem, and the actual primes grow a bit faster. So maybe the actual n is less than 550. But this is just a rough estimate. The only way to know is to compute the sum step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of primes being around n log n, the sum of the first n primes is roughly (n^2 log n)/2. But perhaps this isn't accurate. Wait, let me check some actual data. For example, the sum of the first 100 primes. Let's see, the 100th prime is 541. The sum can be found in tables. But I don't remember offhand. Alternatively, let's take a smaller n. For n=10, the 10th prime is 29. The sum is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29=129. The formula (10\u00b2 log 10)/2 = 100 *2.302/2\u2248115.1. So 129 vs 115.1. So the actual sum is higher. So maybe the formula underestimates. So perhaps the actual sum is larger, meaning that the required n might be lower than the approximation. So perhaps for n=500, the sum would be higher than the formula suggests, so maybe even n=500 would have sum over 1e6. Wait, but according to the formula, (500^2 * ln 500)/2 \u2248 (250,000 * 6.2146)/2 \u2248250,000 *3.107\u2248776,750. So according to formula, sum is about 776,750, but actual sum is higher. Let's check actual data: the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913 (I remember this from previous problems). Wait, 3.68 million. So 1000 primes sum to 3.68 million. So 1 million would require less than 1000 primes. But when exactly? Let's see: The sum of the first 500 primes. Let's see, maybe around 500 primes? For example, the sum of the first 100 primes is 24133 (I might be wrong, but perhaps). Let me check via a quick calculation. Let me list first 10 primes and their sum: 2+3=5, +5=10, +7=17, +11=28, +13=41, +17=58, +19=77, +23=100, +29=129. So sum of first 10 is 129. Then, let's say sum of first 100 primes. According to some references, the sum of the first 100 primes is 24133. So that's about 24,133. Then the sum of first 1000 primes is 3,682,913. So, if the sum at 1000 is ~3.68 million, which is over 1e6. But where does it cross 1e6? Let's see, maybe around 750 primes? Let's try to estimate. Suppose sum grows roughly quadratically. From 100 to 1000 primes, sum increases from ~24k to ~3.68 million, which is a factor of ~152. The number of primes increases by 9x, sum by 152x. So maybe sum is proportional to n\u00b2. So if sum at n=500 is approx (sum at 1000) multiplied by (500/1000)^2, which would be 3.68 million /4 = 920,000. So sum of first 500 primes is around 920,000. But 920k is still less than 1e6. Then sum at 550 primes would be (550/1000)^2 *3.68 million= (0.55)^2=0.3025*3.68 million=1.113 million. So sum of first 550 primes is approximately 1.1 million, which exceeds 1e6. Therefore, the answer is around 550. But this is a rough approximation. But since the actual sum of first 500 primes is higher than 920k (since the formula under-estimates), maybe even n=500 might get close. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I need to look up a list of the sums of primes. But since I can't do that, I need to figure out the actual approach.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the primes in order, keep adding them until the sum exceeds 1e6. So let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize sum = 0, count = 0.\n2. Generate the next prime number.\n3. Add it to the sum, increment count by 1.\n4. Check if sum > 1e6. If yes, return count. Else, repeat.\n\nThe problem now is generating primes efficiently. Let's think about how to generate primes one by one. For each candidate number, check if it's prime. Since primes can get large, but in this case, since the sum needs to exceed 1e6, the primes involved are up to maybe a few thousand? Let's see, if the sum is 1e6, and the average prime in the list is about 1e6 /n. Suppose n is around 500, so average prime is 2000. So primes up to maybe 2000. So checking primes up to that using trial division might be feasible, even if a bit slow.\n\nWait, but even for primes up to, say, 10,000, trial division is manageable for a computer but maybe time-consuming for a human. However, in the context of this question, perhaps I can proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, use a list of primes. But perhaps the answer is known from existing resources. Wait, for example, the sum of the first 168 primes is 77,274. That's way below 1e6. The sum of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913. So between 168 and 1000. To find the exact n, we need to find when the sum crosses 1e6.\n\nWait, but perhaps the exact sum of primes up to a certain count can be looked up. But since I can't access external resources, I need to estimate or find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a known approximation. Wait, according to the sum of the first n primes, there's an approximate formula which is (n^2)(log n)/2. But this is an approximation. Let's try to use that.\n\nWe need (n^2)(log n)/2 > 1e6 => n^2 log n > 2e6.\n\nLet's plug in n=500: 500^2 * log(500) = 250,000 * 6.2146 \u2248 1,553,650. Which is less than 2e6. So 500^2 log n would be 1.55 million, which is under 2e6. So n=500 gives sum ~776k (1.55m/2). Not enough. For n=600: 600^2 * log(600). 600^2=360,000. log(600)=6.3969. So 360,000 *6.3969\u22482,302,884. So 2,302,884 /2 \u22481,151,442. So the approximate sum would be ~1.15 million. So this is over 1e6. So according to the approximation, the n is around 600. But since the actual sum is higher, maybe the actual n is around 550 or 500. Hmm. But again, this is an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a list or code to compute. Since I can't code here, but I can try to compute the sum step by step manually for a few primes to get an idea.\n\nBut that would take too long. Maybe think of an alternative approach. Let's consider that the sum of the first n primes is known to cross 1e6 at n=???\n\nWait, maybe I can recall from previous knowledge. For example, the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913. So the sum of the first 750 primes would be approximately 3.68 million * (750/1000)^2 = 3.68 million * 0.5625 \u2248 2.07 million. But that's still over a million. So even 750 primes give over 2 million sum. That's not possible. Wait, this approach is flawed. Wait, if sum is proportional to n\u00b2, then scaling would be as such. But given that the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3.68 million, that would suggest that sum(n) grows faster than n\u00b2. Because the first 100 primes sum to 24k, which is (100)^2=10,000, but actual sum is 24k, which is higher. So maybe sum(n) is roughly proportional to n^2. Then, for sum(n)=1e6, n would be sqrt(1e6 / (3.68e6)) *1000. Wait, but that's sqrt(1e6/3.68e6)\u2248sqrt(0.2717)\u22480.521. So 0.521*1000\u2248521. So n\u2248521. But this is a rough estimate. However, given that the sum of the first 521 primes would be around 3.68e6 * (521/1000)^2 \u22483.68e6 *0.271\u22481 million. So maybe around 521. So, perhaps the answer is around 550 or 520 primes.\n\nBut in reality, the sum of the first n primes is not exactly following a perfect n\u00b2 relation, but this gives an idea.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the answer in known mathematical references, but since I can't, I have to proceed logically.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in the problem where the sum of the first n primes exceeds 1000, the answer is n=17. Because sum first 17 primes is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29+31+37+41+43+47+53+59= 440 (wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I should calculate that again: 2,3,5,7,11 sum to 28. Then next primes:13 (sum 41), 17 (58), 19 (77), 23 (100), 29 (129), 31 (160), 37 (197), 41 (238), 43 (281), 47 (328), 53 (381), 59 (440), 61 (501), 67 (568), 71 (639), 73 (712), 79 (791), 83 (874), 89 (963), 97 (1060). So the sum first 21 primes is 1060. So the answer for sum over 1000 is n=21. That's just to check. But in that case, the sum grows to 1060 at n=21. So for 1e6, a much larger n is required.\n\nBut how to proceed? Let's think of the prime generating process. Let's list the primes and add them step by step. But since this would take a lot of time, perhaps think of a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the following code logic:\n\nInitialize sum = 0, count = 0, current_number = 2.\n\nWhile sum <= 1e6:\n\n    if current_number is prime:\n\n        sum += current_number\n\n        count +=1\n\n    current_number +=1\n\nOnce the sum exceeds 1e6, return count.\n\nBut how to check for primes efficiently?\n\nFor each current_number, check divisibility up to sqrt(current_number). For example, for 2, it's prime. Add to sum. Then 3, prime. Add. Then 4, not prime. Then 5, prime. Add. Continue.\n\nBut this is time-consuming manually, but perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, estimate the number of primes needed. Let's assume the primes are approximately of the order of n log n. So sum would be roughly the sum of the first n primes, which is roughly n^2 log n /2.\n\nSet that equal to 1e6:\n\nn^2 log n /2 = 1e6\n\nn^2 log n = 2e6\n\nLet's try to approximate n.\n\nLet's take logarithms.\n\nLet\u2019s take natural logs:\n\nln(n^2 log n) = ln(2e6)\n\nln(n^2) + ln(log n) = ln(2e6)\n\n2 ln n + ln(log n) = ln(2e6)\n\nln(2e6) \u2248 ln(2) + ln(1e6) \u2248 0.693 + 13.8155 \u224814.5085.\n\nSo 2 ln n + ln(ln n) =14.5085.\n\nThis is a transcendental equation. Maybe use iterative methods.\n\nLet\u2019s guess n=500:\n\nln(500)=6.2146, 2*6.2146=12.429, ln(6.2146)=1.827. Sum=12.429+1.827\u224814.256, which is close to 14.5085. Need a bit higher.\n\nNext guess n=550:\n\nln(550)=6.3099. 2*6.3099=12.6198. ln(6.3099)=1.842. Sum\u224812.6198+1.842\u224814.4618. Still less than 14.5085. Next, n=560.\n\nln(560)=6.3279. 2*6.3279\u224812.6558. ln(6.3279)=1.845. Sum\u224812.6558+1.845\u224814.5008. Very close to 14.5085. So n\u2248560. So according to this approximation, n\u2248560.\n\nBut since the actual sum of the first n primes is higher than the approximation (as earlier examples showed), maybe the actual n is lower than this. For example, the approximation gives sum\u2248(560^2 * log 560)/2 \u2248 (313600 *6.3279)/2 \u2248 (313600 *3.16395)\u2248992,000. Which is close to 1e6. But the actual sum is higher. So maybe the actual sum would exceed 1e6 around n=560.\n\nBut how to get the exact value? Well, the answer probably requires knowing the exact sum, which would be a known value. Since I can't compute it manually here, I need to recall or find the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 568. Wait, but I need to check. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 1000. No, because the sum of first 1000 primes is 3.68 million. That's way over.\n\nAlternatively, think of cumulative prime sums. For example, according to the OEIS sequence A007504, which lists the sum of the first n primes.\n\nLooking up A007504, the sum of the first n primes:\n\nFor example:\n\nn=1: 2\n\nn=2:5\n\nn=3:10\n\nn=4:17\n\nn=5:28\n\n... and so on.\n\nBut we need to go up until the sum exceeds 1e6. Since I can't look this up now, I need to proceed via reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the OEIS sequence, the sum for n=1000 is 3,682,913 as mentioned earlier. Let's check for n=500. If the sum for n=500 is around 1,555,050 (as per the approximation), but actual sum would be higher. Suppose the real sum for n=500 is 1.6 million. Then the answer would be around 500. But if the actual sum is lower, say 800,000, then n would need to be higher.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the sum of the first 550 primes. If the sum of the first 550 primes is approximately 1.1 million (based on the approximation), then the answer is 550. But the exact value requires knowing the actual sum.\n\nBut since I can't compute this manually, perhaps the answer is 568. Wait, why 568? Because if each prime averages around 2000, then 568 primes would sum to about 1,136,000. Which is over 1e6. But the average isn't that high. The first few primes are small, so the average is lower. For example, the first 100 primes have an average of 24,133/100\u2248241. Then the average increases as n increases. The 1000th prime is 7919. So the average of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913 /1000 \u22483683. So for n=1000, average is ~3683. So for n=568, the average might be around 1800. So sum=568*1800\u22481,022,400. So that's over 1e6. So perhaps n is around 568. But I need to check the exact sum.\n\nAlternatively, I found that the sum of the first 758 primes is 1,034,074. So if that's the case, then the answer would be 758. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 168. But the sum of the first 168 primes is 77,274, which is way too low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1060. But I have no idea. This is getting frustrating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 568, 550, or something similar, but I need to be precise.\n\nWait, let's think of another approach. Let's consider that the sum of primes up to some number x is approximately equal to the integral of the prime density function from 2 to x. But integrating this would be complex. Alternatively, using the approximation that the sum of primes less than or equal to x is approximately (x^2)/(2 log x). So solving (x^2)/(2 log x) \u22481e6. Then x^2 \u22482e6 log x. But this seems similar to the previous equation but in terms of x instead of n.\n\nBut perhaps using the approximation that the nth prime is roughly n log n. Let's suppose that the nth prime is approximately n log n. Then the sum of the first n primes would be approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k log k. But the sum of k log k from 1 to n is roughly (n\u00b2 log n)/2 - n\u00b2/(4 ln 2) (from some integral approximation). But this might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate the sum as integral from 1 to n of x log x dx. The integral of x log x dx is (x\u00b2/2)(log x - 1/2). Let's compute this from 1 to n:\n\nIntegral \u2248 (n\u00b2/2)(log n - 0.5) - (1^2/2)(log 1 -0.5) = (n\u00b2/2)(log n -0.5) -0, since log 1=0.\n\nSo setting this equal to 1e6:\n\n(n\u00b2/2)(log n -0.5) \u22481e6.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nn\u00b2 (log n -0.5) \u22482e6.\n\nNow, solving for n. Let's make an initial guess n=500.\n\nlog n = ln(500)\u22486.2146.\n\nlog n -0.5=5.7146.\n\nn\u00b2=250,000. 250,000 *5.7146\u22481,428,650. Which is less than 2e6.\n\nn=600: log n=6.3969, log n -0.5=5.8969. n\u00b2=360,000. 360,000*5.8969\u22482,122,884. Which is over 2e6. So between 500 and 600.\n\nLet's find n where n\u00b2 (log n -0.5)=2e6.\n\nTry n=550:\n\nlog n\u22486.309, log n -0.5\u22485.809. n\u00b2=302,500. 302,500 *5.809\u2248302,500 *5=1,512,500 plus 302,500*0.809\u2248244,  many, approximate total 1,512,500 +244, 1,756,500. Still under 2e6.\n\nn=580: log n=6.363, log n -0.5=5.863. n\u00b2=580^2=336,400. 336,400 *5.863\u2248336,400*5=1,682,000 +336,400*0.863\u2248290,000. Total\u22481,682,000 +290,000=1,972,000. Close to 2e6.\n\nn=590: log n\u22486.38, log n-0.5=5.88. n\u00b2=348,100. 348,100 *5.88\u2248348,100*5=1,740,500 +348,100*0.88\u2248306, 328. Total\u22481,740,500 +306,328=2,046,828. Over 2e6. So n between 580 and 590.\n\nAt n=585: log n\u22486.37, log n-0.5=5.87. n\u00b2=585^2=342,225. 342,225*5.87\u2248342,225*5=1,711,125 +342,225*0.87\u2248297, 736. Total\u22481,711,125 +297,736=2,008,861. Close to 2e6.\n\nSo n\u2248585 gives integral\u22482,008,861, which is just over 2e6. So sum of primes is approximately (n\u00b2/2)(log n -0.5) \u22481,004,430. Which is over 1e6. So according to this approximation, the answer is around 585. But considering that the actual sum is higher than the approximation, the actual n would be lower. Hmmm. For example, if the approximation is 1,004,430 for n=585, but actual sum is higher, then the actual sum might cross 1e6 at a lower n. So perhaps n=550?\n\nBut this is all estimation. Without actual data, it's difficult to give an exact answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall from previous knowledge that the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3,682,913. Then, if we interpolate between known sums, but I don't have such data. Alternatively, I can think of a different approach. For example, if the sum of the first n primes is approximately (n^2) * (log n)/2, then set this equal to 1e6 and solve for n. Let's try that again.\n\n(n\u00b2 log n)/2 =1e6 \u2192 n\u00b2 log n=2e6.\n\nTrial:\n\nn=500: 500\u00b2=250k *6.214\u22481,553,500. Which is less than 2e6.\n\nn=550:550\u00b2=302,500 * log(550)=6.309 \u2192 302,500*6.309\u22481,907,  the product is 302,500*6=1,815,000 and 302,500*0.309\u224893,  so total\u22481,815,000+93,000=1,908,000. Still under 2e6.\n\nn=570:570\u00b2=324,900. log570\u22486.3456. Multiply:324,900*6.3456\u2248324,900*6=1,949,400 +324,900*0.3456\u2248 324,900*0.3=97,470 and 324,900*0.0456\u224814,800. Total\u22481,949,400+97,470+14,800\u22482,061,670. Which is over 2e6.\n\nSo with n=570, we have n\u00b2 log n\u22482,061,670, which is over 2e6. So according to the approximation, the sum is 2,061,670/2=1,030,835. So the approximate sum is 1.03 million. So the actual sum would be higher, so the actual sum would cross 1e6 at an n slightly lower than 570. Let's see for n=560:\n\nn=560, log n\u22486.327. n\u00b2=313,600. 313,600*6.327\u2248313,600*6=1,881,600 +313,600*0.327\u2248102,547. Total\u22481,984,147. So sum\u22481,984,147/2=992,073. Under 1e6. So n=560 yields approx 992k. n=565:\n\nn=565: log n\u22486.337. n\u00b2=565\u00b2=319,225. 319,225*6.337\u2248319,225*6=1,915,350 +319,225*0.337\u2248107,  then total\u22482,022, 350. Sum\u22481,011,175. Over 1e6. So according to this approximation, n=565 gives sum\u22481.01 million. So the answer is approximately 565.\n\nBut since the actual sum is higher than the approximation, the actual n would be less than 565. So perhaps around 550-560.\n\nBut since I can't compute this exactly, how to proceed? The answer is likely 568, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's 550. But without exact data, I can't be certain. \n\nWait, I remember that the sum of the first 550 primes is approximately 1,011,000. If that's the case, then the answer is 550. However, I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 568. Because if each prime from 550 to 568 adds about 2000 on average, then 18 primes would add 36,000, which would push the sum from 992k (at 560) to 1,028k, which exceeds 1e6. But this is very approximate.\n\nGiven that without exact data, the best approach is to use the approximation and adjust based on the knowledge that the actual sum is higher. So the approximation suggests n=565 gives sum ~1,011,000, but actual sum would be higher, so maybe the actual n is around 550-560. However, since the problem asks for the exact answer, which is a specific integer, I must either know it or have a way to compute it.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, I might have to accept that the answer is 568. Alternatively, check how the sum of primes progresses.\n\nWait, let's take a different approach. Let's consider that the sum of the first n primes is roughly proportional to n^2 log n. To reach 1e6, solve n^2 log n \u22482e6. Assume that log is natural log.\n\nWe can use iterative guesses. Let's try n=500:\n\n500\u00b2*log(500)=250,000 *6.214\u22481,553,500 <2e6.\n\nn=550:550\u00b2*log(550)=302,500 *6.309\u2248302,500*6=1,815,000 +302,500*0.309\u224893,  so\u22481,908,000 <2e6.\n\nn=570:570\u00b2*log(570)=324,900 *6.345\u2248324,900 *6=1,949,400 +324,900*0.345\u2248112,  total\u22482,061,400 >2e6.\n\nSo between 550 and 570.\n\nLet's find where 324,900*n\u22482e6 at n=570. Let's see n=560:\n\n560\u00b2=313,600. log(560)\u22486.327.\n\n313,600*6.327\u2248313,600*6=1,881,600 +313,600*0.327\u2248102,  total\u22481,983,600.\n\nTo reach 2e6, need 16,400 more. Each additional n adds (2n+1) log (n+1) + (n+1)^2 * derivative of log(n). Maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for each increment in n from 560 to 570:\n\nAt n=560: 1,983,600.\n\nEach additional prime adds approximately (2n+1) log n +n\u00b2*(1/n) (from derivative). Not sure. Maybe approximate the increase per n.\n\nAlternatively, assume that for each increase in n by 1, the term n\u00b2 log n increases by roughly (n+1)^2 log(n+1) -n\u00b2 log n.\n\nFor n=560, that's 561\u00b2 log561 -560\u00b2 log560.\n\nCompute this:\n\n561\u00b2=314,721. log561\u22486.329.\n\n560\u00b2=313,600. log560\u22486.327.\n\n314,721*6.329 \u2248314,721*6=1,888,326 +314,721*0.329\u2248103,  total\u22481,888,326+103,000\u22481,991,326.\n\nPrevious n=560: 313,600*6.327\u22481,983,600.\n\nSo the increase is 1,991,326 -1,983,600\u22487,726 per n=1. So to reach 2e6 from 1,983,600, need delta of 16,400. How many steps? 16,400 /7,726\u22482.12. So approximately 2 more n steps. So at n=562, the value would be approximately 1,983,600 +7,726*2\u22481,983,600 +15,452\u22481,999,052. Still under. Next step at n=563: +7,726\u22482,006,778. So for n=563, the term n\u00b2 log n\u22482,006,778, which exceeds 2e6.\n\nThus, according to this approximation, n=563 would yield sum\u22482.006e6 /2=1.003e6. So the sum exceeds 1e6 at n=563. Thus, the answer would be 563. But again, this is an approximation, and the actual sum may differ. Therefore, the answer is approximately 563.\n\nBut since the problem requires an exact answer, I must choose the closest option. However, since I don't have exact data, I can't be sure. But given the approximations, the answer is likely around 563. However, in actuality, the sum of the first n primes may require a different n. For example, the actual sum might exceed 1e6 at n=568.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall from previous knowledge that the correct answer is 568. But I'm not 100% certain. However, based on the approximation and the thought process, I'll go with 568 as the answer.",
