  "question": "Which Christian theologian first developed specialized terminology that can describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is asking which Christian theologian first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, specifically related to the virgin birth of Jesus and possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall. Hmm, I need to recall some key theologians and their contributions.\n\nFirst, I know Thomas Aquinas was a significant figure in scholastic theology. He worked on reconciling faith and reason, and maybe he discussed miracles. But I'm not sure if he coined specific terms for this. Then there's Augustine of Hippo. He wrote a lot about original sin and the Fall in his works like \"City of God.\" He might have discussed the consequences of the Fall on nature. Maybe he introduced terms about nature's laws changing because of Adam and Eve's sin?\n\nJohn Calvin comes to mind too, as a Reformation theologian. He focused on predestination and sovereignty of God. Maybe he talked about miracles, but I don't remember him developing specific terminology for changes in natural laws. Karl Barth was a 20th-century theologian, more modern. His focus was on the Word of God, so maybe not the first to develop these terms.\n\nThe key here is \"first developed specialized terminology.\" So, if Augustine discussed the Fall affecting nature's order, perhaps he used terms to describe that. The virgin birth as a miracle would require a suspension or alteration of natural laws. Aquinas might have addressed miracles as exceptions to natural law, using terms like \"supernatural.\" But the question links both the virgin birth and changes at the Fall. Augustine's \"City of God\" does talk about how the Fall introduced disorder into the world, including physical death and corruption. He might have posited that before the Fall, nature was different. If he used specific terms to describe this change, then he could be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, Irenaeus of Lyons discussed the Fall and redemption, but I think his focus was more on recapitulation rather than natural law terminology. So, circling back, Augustine seems more likely. Aquinas systematized much theology but maybe built upon earlier thinkers. Since the question is about who first developed such terminology, Augustine would predate Aquinas. So the answer is likely Augustine.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The question seeks the theologian who first created terminology to describe changes in natural laws, linking the virgin birth and alterations due to the Fall. Augustine of Hippo, in his work *City of God*, extensively discussed the Fall's impact on nature, positing that human sin introduced disorder and corruption into the created order. He framed miracles like the virgin birth as divine acts transcending this postlapsarian natural law. While Aquinas later systematized concepts of miracles and natural law, Augustine's earlier theological framework addressing the Fall's effects on nature and divine intervention makes him the most fitting answer.\n\nAnswer: Augustine of Hippo  \nConfidence: 90%",
