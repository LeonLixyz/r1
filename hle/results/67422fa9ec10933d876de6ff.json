  "question": "Find the inverse of the function $f(x) = -|x+2|+|x-3|-0.5 x + 2 $ and write the answer as a single equation using absolute value function.",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the inverse of the function f(x) = -|x+2| + |x-3| - 0.5x + 2 and express it as a single equation using absolute value. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky because of the absolute value terms and the linear part. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find an inverse function, I usually solve the equation y = f(x) for x in terms of y, then swap x and y. But with absolute values, the function might have different expressions depending on the value of x, so I need to consider different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. The absolute value terms here are |x + 2| and |x - 3|. The critical points occur at x = -2 and x = 3. So, the function f(x) will have different expressions in the intervals (-\u221e, -2), [-2, 3), and [3, \u221e).\n\nLet me handle each interval separately.\n\nCase 1: x < -2\nIn this interval, x + 2 is negative, and x - 3 is also negative. So, |x + 2| = -(x + 2) = -x - 2, and |x - 3| = -(x - 3) = -x + 3. Plugging these into f(x):\nf(x) = -(-x -2) + (-x +3) -0.5x +2\nSimplify:\n= x + 2 -x + 3 -0.5x +2\nCombine like terms:\n(x - x -0.5x) + (2 +3 +2) = (-0.5x) +7\nSo f(x) = -0.5x +7 for x < -2.\n\nCase 2: -2 \u2264 x < 3\nHere, x + 2 is non-negative, and x -3 is negative. So |x + 2| = x +2, |x -3| = -x +3. Plugging into f(x):\nf(x) = -(x +2) + (-x +3) -0.5x +2\nSimplify:\n= -x -2 -x +3 -0.5x +2\nCombine terms:\n(-x -x -0.5x) + (-2 +3 +2) = (-2.5x) +3\nSo f(x) = -2.5x +3 for -2 \u2264 x <3.\n\nCase 3: x \u2265 3\nHere, both x +2 and x -3 are non-negative. So |x +2| = x +2, |x -3| =x -3. Plug into f(x):\nf(x) = -(x +2) + (x -3) -0.5x +2\nSimplify:\n= -x -2 +x -3 -0.5x +2\nCombine terms:\n(-x +x -0.5x) + (-2 -3 +2) = (-0.5x) -3\nSo f(x) = -0.5x -3 for x \u22653.\n\nNow I have the piecewise function:\nf(x) = -0.5x +7, x < -2\n       -2.5x +3, -2 \u2264x <3\n       -0.5x -3, x \u22653\n\nNext step is to find the inverse. For each piece, I need to check if they are strictly increasing or decreasing, and whether they are injective (one-to-one) in their intervals.\n\nLooking at the first piece, -0.5x +7. The slope is -0.5, which is negative. So this is a decreasing function. Its domain is x < -2. Let's find its range. As x approaches -2 from the left, the value approaches -0.5*(-2) +7 =1 +7=8. As x approaches -\u221e, the term -0.5x dominates, so f(x) approaches +\u221e. So the range of the first piece is (8, \u221e).\n\nSecond piece: -2.5x +3, slope -2.5, also decreasing. Domain is -2 \u2264x <3. At x = -2, f(x) = -2.5*(-2) +3 =5 +3=8. At x approaching 3 from the left, f(x) approaches -2.5*3 +3= -7.5 +3= -4.5. So the range here is (-4.5, 8].\n\nThird piece: -0.5x -3, slope -0.5, decreasing. Domain x \u22653. At x=3, f(x)= -0.5*3 -3= -1.5 -3= -4.5. As x approaches \u221e, f(x) approaches -\u221e. So the range here is (-\u221e, -4.5].\n\nSo overall, the function f(x) is decreasing over all real numbers because each piece is decreasing, and the ranges connect: (from the first piece) (8, \u221e) then from 8 to -4.5 in the second, then continues decreasing to -\u221e. So the entire function is decreasing, hence strictly monotonic, so injective. Therefore, the inverse exists.\n\nBut wait, even though each piece is decreasing, we have overlapping ranges? Wait, the first piece's range is (8, \u221e), second is (-4.5,8], third is (-\u221e, -4.5]. So when combined, the entire range is (-\u221e, \u221e)? Because the first piece goes from \u221e to 8, the second from 8 down to -4.5, then third from -4.5 to -\u221e. Wait, but that would mean the function's range is all real numbers. Because between \u221e and 8 (from first piece), 8 to -4.5 (second), and then -4.5 to -\u221e (third). So for any real y, there exists an x such that f(x)=y. Therefore, the inverse function is defined for all real y.\n\nTherefore, the inverse function f^{-1}(y) will have different expressions depending on the value of y.\n\nLet me find the inverse for each piece.\n\nFor the first piece: y = -0.5x +7, x < -2.\nSolve for x:\ny = -0.5x +7\n=> -0.5x = y -7\n=> x = (7 - y)/0.5\n=> x = 14 - 2y\n\nBut in this case, the original x was < -2. So the corresponding y is in (8, \u221e). Therefore, when solving for x in terms of y, we have x =14 -2y, but we need to ensure that this x is < -2. Let's see:\n\nx =14 -2y < -2\n=>14 -2y < -2\n=> -2y < -16\n=> y >8. Which is exactly the range for this piece. So the inverse here is x =14 -2y, for y >8.\n\nSecond piece: y = -2.5x +3, -2 \u2264x <3. Range is (-4.5,8].\n\nSolve for x:\ny = -2.5x +3\n=> -2.5x = y -3\n=>x = (3 - y)/2.5\n=> x = (3 - y)/(5/2)\n=> x = (2/5)(3 - y) = (6 -2y)/5\n\nAnd this x must satisfy -2 \u2264x <3. Let's check the corresponding y:\n\nOriginal x is between -2 and 3. Let's see when x = -2, y =8, and when x approaches 3, y approaches -4.5. So for y between (-4.5,8], x is (6 -2y)/5. Let's verify the domain for x here. For example, when y =8, x= (6 -16)/5=(-10)/5=-2, which matches. When y approaches -4.5 from above, x approaches (6 -2*(-4.5))/5 = (6 +9)/5=15/5=3, which is the upper limit. So yes, this is correct.\n\nThird piece: y = -0.5x -3, x \u22653. Solve for x:\ny = -0.5x -3\n=> -0.5x = y +3\n=>x = (-3 - y)/0.5\n=>x = (-3 - y)/(1/2)\n=>x = -2(3 + y) = -6 -2y\n\nBut original x here is \u22653, so let's check:\n\nx = -6 -2y \u22653\n=> -6 -2y \u22653\n=> -2y \u22659\n=> y \u2264 -4.5. Which is the range for this piece. So inverse here is x = -6 -2y for y \u2264-4.5.\n\nTherefore, the inverse function is piecewise:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = 14 -2y, y >8\n          (6 -2y)/5, -4.5 < y \u22648\n          -6 -2y, y \u2264-4.5\n\nBut the problem asks to write the answer as a single equation using absolute value functions. So I need to combine these three pieces into a single expression with absolute values.\n\nHmm. Let's see. Each piece is a linear function, and the breakpoints are at y=8 and y=-4.5. Maybe I can express it using absolute values that activate depending on the value of y.\n\nAlternatively, think about how to combine the three cases into one formula. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inverse can be written in terms of expressions involving |y - a| or |y + b|. Let me see.\n\nBut this is challenging. Let's analyze the inverse function expressions:\n\nFor y >8: x =14 -2y\n\nFor y between -4.5 and8: x=(6 -2y)/5\n\nFor y <=-4.5: x= -6 -2y\n\nSo these are three linear segments. To write this as a single equation with absolute values, perhaps we can find a combination of absolute values that correspond to these linear pieces.\n\nAlternatively, express the inverse function as a linear combination plus some absolute value terms that adjust based on the intervals.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the middle piece first. The middle inverse is (6 -2y)/5. The other two pieces are 14 -2y and -6 -2y. Let's see how these relate.\n\nThe slopes of the inverse functions are:\n\nFor y >8: slope -2\n\nFor middle: slope -2/5 \u2248 -0.4\n\nFor y <=-4.5: slope -2\n\nSo the left and right pieces have the same slope, steeper than the middle. So perhaps the inverse function can be represented as a combination of a linear term and absolute value terms that adjust the slope in certain intervals.\n\nAlternatively, since the inverse function has different expressions depending on whether y is above 8, between -4.5 and8, or below -4.5, maybe we can write expressions involving |y -8| and |y +4.5|.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, note that the inverse function in the middle region can be written as (6 -2y)/5. Let's see if that can be represented as a combination of terms. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we have a linear term and then add or subtract some absolute values. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, observe that the inverse function for the middle piece is x = (6 -2y)/5, which is the same as x = - (2y -6)/5. Let's see if this can be connected to the other pieces.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire inverse function as:\n\nx = -2y + C + D*|y - A| + E*|y - B|\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to express the piecewise function as a single equation.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that the inverse function has two breakpoints at y=8 and y=-4.5. The absolute value functions can be used to handle these breakpoints.\n\nLet me consider the difference between the middle expression and the other expressions. For example, when y >8, the inverse is 14 -2y. Let's see how this relates to the middle expression when y=8: (6 -2*8)/5 = (6 -16)/5 = (-10)/5 = -2. Wait, but 14 -2*8=14-16=-2. So at y=8, both expressions give x=-2. Similarly, at y=-4.5, the middle expression gives (6 -2*(-4.5))/5=(6 +9)/5=15/5=3. The third piece gives x=-6 -2*(-4.5)= -6 +9=3. So they agree at the breakpoints.\n\nThis suggests that the inverse function is continuous. Now, to write this as a single equation, maybe express the inverse as a combination of the middle term plus adjustments based on whether y is above 8 or below -4.5.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following approach. Since the inverse function for y >8 is x =14 -2y, which can also be written as x= (6 -2y)/5 + (14 -2y - (6 -2y)/5). Let's compute that:\n\n(6 -2y)/5 + ( (5*(14 -2y) - (6 -2y)) /5 )\n= (6 -2y)/5 + (70 -10y -6 +2y)/5\n= (6 -2y)/5 + (64 -8y)/5\n= (6 -2y +64 -8y)/5\n= (70 -10y)/5\n=14 -2y, which matches.\n\nBut this seems convoluted. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the inverse function can be represented as x = A*y + B + C*|y -8| + D*|y +4.5|\n\nBut how to find A, B, C, D?\n\nWait, let's look at the three pieces:\n\n1. For y >8: x =14 -2y\n\n2. For -4.5 <y \u22648: x=(6 -2y)/5\n\n3. For y \u2264-4.5: x=-6 -2y\n\nWe need to express these three as a single formula. Let's denote that in regions where y >8 or y < -4.5, we have terms that adjust the middle expression.\n\nCompare the middle expression (6 -2y)/5 with the other two:\n\nWhen y >8, the difference between 14 -2y and (6 -2y)/5 is:\n\n14 -2y - (6 -2y)/5 = (70 -10y -6 +2y)/5 = (64 -8y)/5 = (8*(8 -y))/5.\n\nBut y >8 here, so (8 - y) is negative, but this might relate to an absolute value.\n\nSimilarly, when y < -4.5, the difference between -6 -2y and (6 -2y)/5 is:\n\n-6 -2y - (6 -2y)/5 = (-30 -10y -6 +2y)/5 = (-36 -8y)/5 = (-4*(9 + 2y))/5.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the inverse function as a combination of the middle term plus terms that are proportional to the absolute values of (y -8) and (y +4.5), but in such a way that they only contribute when y is beyond those points.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we write:\n\nx = (6 -2y)/5 + K*|y -8| + L*|y +4.5|\n\nWe need to find K and L such that:\n\n- For y >8: x = (6 -2y)/5 + K*(y -8) + L*0 (since y +4.5 >0 here). This should equal 14 -2y.\n\nSo:\n\n(6 -2y)/5 + K*(y -8) =14 -2y\n\nMultiply through by 5 to eliminate denominator:\n\n6 -2y +5K(y -8) =70 -10y\n\nExpand:\n\n6 -2y +5K y -40K =70 -10y\n\nGroup like terms:\n\n(-2y +5K y) + (6 -40K) =70 -10y\n\nFactor y:\n\ny(-2 +5K) + (6 -40K) =70 -10y\n\nCompare coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of y: -2 +5K = -10 \u2192 5K = -8 \u2192 K= -8/5\n\nConstant term:6 -40K =70\n\nSubstitute K= -8/5:\n\n6 -40*(-8/5) =6 + 64=70. Which holds.\n\nSo K= -8/5.\n\nSimilarly, for y \u2264-4.5:\n\nx = (6 -2y)/5 + K*|y -8| + L*|y +4.5|\n\nBut here, y \u2264-4.5, so |y -8|=8 -y, and |y +4.5|= -y -4.5.\n\nSo:\n\nx= (6 -2y)/5 + (-8/5)*(8 -y) + L*(-y -4.5)\n\nThis should equal -6 -2y.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n(6 -2y)/5 + (-8/5)(8 -y) + L*(-y -4.5) = -6 -2y\n\nMultiply through by 5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6 -2y -8*(8 -y) +5L*(-y -4.5) = -30 -10y\n\nCompute:\n\n6 -2y -64 +8y +5L*(-y -4.5) = -30 -10y\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n( -2y +8y ) + (6 -64) +5L*(-y -4.5) = -30 -10y\n\n6y -58 +5L*(-y -4.5) = -30 -10y\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n6y -58 +5L*(-y -4.5) +30 +10y =0\n\n16y -28 +5L*(-y -4.5)=0\n\nFactor terms:\n\n16y -28 -5L y -22.5L =0\n\nGroup variables:\n\ny(16 -5L) + (-28 -22.5L)=0\n\nFor this equation to hold for all y \u2264-4.5, coefficients must be zero:\n\n16 -5L =0 \u2192 5L=16 \u2192 L=16/5=3.2\n\nAnd:\n\n-28 -22.5L=0 \u2192 -28 -22.5*(16/5)= -28 -72= -100 \u22600.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So this approach might not work. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need a different setup. Perhaps instead, include two absolute terms, each active in one of the outer regions.\n\nAlternatively, think about the inverse function's form. Let me look at the expressions again.\n\nFirst piece: x=14 -2y (y>8)\n\nSecond: x=(6 -2y)/5 ( -4.5<y\u22648 )\n\nThird: x= -6 -2y (y\u2264-4.5 )\n\nMaybe express x in terms of y and the maximum or minimum functions. But the problem requires using absolute values. Alternatively, use the fact that for any real number a, |a| = a if a\u22650 and -a otherwise. So we can express the different cases using absolute values.\n\nAnother approach: The inverse function changes its formula at y=8 and y=-4.5. Let's denote that the inverse function can be written as x = A*y + B + C*|y -8| + D*|y +4.5|. We can set up equations based on the three cases to solve for A, B, C, D.\n\nBut with four variables and three equations (one for each piece), it might be underdetermined. Alternatively, perhaps it can be expressed with fewer terms. Let me see.\n\nWait, notice that the slopes in the first and third pieces are both -2, while the middle is -2/5. The difference in slope between the middle and the outer regions is (-2) - (-2/5) = -8/5. So perhaps the term involving |y -8| and |y +4.5| can adjust the slope by -8/5 when y is outside the middle interval.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAssume that x = (-2/5)y + (6/5) + K*( |y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nWait, but this might not work. Alternatively, think of the function as:\n\nx = a*y + b + c*|y -8| + d*|y +4.5|\n\nThen, in the middle interval (-4.5 <y \u22648), both |y -8| =8 -y and |y +4.5|=y +4.5. So x would be:\n\nx= a*y + b + c*(8 -y) + d*(y +4.5 )\n\n= (a -c +d ) y + b +8c +4.5d\n\nWhich should equal (6 -2y)/5. Therefore:\n\nCoefficient of y: (a -c +d ) = -2/5\n\nConstant term: b +8c +4.5d =6/5\n\nFor the first interval y >8, |y -8|=y -8, |y +4.5|=y +4.5. So:\n\nx= a*y + b + c*(y -8) + d*(y +4.5 )\n\n= (a +c +d ) y + b -8c +4.5d\n\nThis should equal 14 -2y. So:\n\nCoefficient: a +c +d = -2\n\nConstant term: b -8c +4.5d =14\n\nFor the third interval y \u2264-4.5, |y -8|=8 -y, |y +4.5|=-y -4.5. So:\n\nx= a*y + b + c*(8 -y) + d*(-y -4.5 )\n\n= (a -c -d ) y + b +8c -4.5d\n\nThis should equal -6 -2y. So:\n\nCoefficient: a -c -d = -2\n\nConstant term: b +8c -4.5d =-6\n\nNow, we have three systems from the three cases:\n\nFrom the middle interval:\n\n1. a -c +d = -2/5\n\n2. b +8c +4.5d =6/5\n\nFrom the first interval:\n\n3. a +c +d = -2\n\n4. b -8c +4.5d =14\n\nFrom the third interval:\n\n5. a -c -d =-2\n\n6. b +8c -4.5d =-6\n\nNow, we have three equations for a, b, c, d. Let me see if this system is solvable.\n\nFirst, let's handle the equations for a:\n\nFrom equations 1 and3 and5.\n\nEquation1: a -c +d =-2/5\n\nEquation3: a +c +d = -2\n\nEquation5: a -c -d =-2\n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation3:\n\n(a +c +d) - (a -c +d ) = -2 - (-2/5 )\n\n=> 2c = -2 +2/5 = -10/5 + 2/5= -8/5 \u2192 c= -4/5.\n\nNow, subtract equation1 from equation5:\n\n(a -c -d ) - (a -c +d ) = -2 - (-2/5 )\n\n=> -2d = -2 +2/5 = -10/5 +2/5= -8/5 \u2192 d= 4/5.\n\nNow, substitute c= -4/5 and d=4/5 into equation1:\n\na - (-4/5) +4/5 =-2/5 \u2192 a +4/5 +4/5= a +8/5= -2/5 \u2192 a= -2/5 -8/5= -10/5= -2.\n\nSo a= -2. Check with equation3:\n\na +c +d= -2 + (-4/5) +4/5= -2 +0= -2, which matches equation3. Good.\n\nSimilarly, equation5: a -c -d= -2 -(-4/5) -4/5= -2 +4/5 -4/5= -2, which matches equation5. Good.\n\nNow, we have a= -2, c= -4/5, d=4/5. Now solve for b using equations2,4,6.\n\nEquation2: b +8c +4.5d =6/5\n\nSubstitute c= -4/5, d=4/5:\n\nb +8*(-4/5) +4.5*(4/5) =6/5\n\nCalculate:\n\nb -32/5 + 18/5 =6/5\n\nb -14/5=6/5 \u2192 b=6/5 +14/5=20/5=4.\n\nEquation4: b -8c +4.5d=14\n\nSubstitute c= -4/5, d=4/5, b=4:\n\n4 -8*(-4/5) +4.5*(4/5)=4 +32/5 +18/5=4 +50/5=4 +10=14. Correct.\n\nEquation6: b +8c -4.5d= -6\n\nSubstitute:\n\n4 +8*(-4/5) -4.5*(4/5)=4 -32/5 -18/5=4 -50/5=4 -10= -6. Correct.\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied. Therefore, the inverse function can be written as:\n\nx= a*y +b +c*|y -8| +d*|y +4.5|\n\nSubstituting a=-2, b=4, c=-4/5, d=4/5:\n\nx= -2y +4 - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|\n\nThis combines all three pieces into a single equation. Let me verify with each interval.\n\nFor y >8:\n\nx= -2y +4 - (4/5)(y -8) + (4/5)(y +4.5 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -2y +4 - (4/5)y +32/5 + (4/5)y +18/5\n\nCombine terms:\n\n-2y +4 + ( -4/5 y +4/5 y ) + (32/5 +18/5 )\n\n= -2y +4 +0 +50/5\n\n= -2y +4 +10\n\n= -2y +14. Which matches the first piece. Correct.\n\nFor y between -4.5 and8:\n\nx= -2y +4 - (4/5)(8 -y) + (4/5)(y +4.5 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -2y +4 - (32/5 -4/5 y ) + (4/5 y + 18/5 )\n\n= -2y +4 -32/5 +4/5 y +4/5 y +18/5\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(-2y +4/5 y +4/5 y ) + (4 -32/5 +18/5 )\n\n= (-2y +8/5 y ) + (20/5 -32/5 +18/5 )\n\n= (-10/5 y +8/5 y ) + (6/5 )\n\n= (-2/5 y ) +6/5\n\n= (6 -2y)/5. Which matches the middle piece. Correct.\n\nFor y \u2264-4.5:\n\nx= -2y +4 - (4/5)(8 -y) + (4/5)(-y -4.5 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -2y +4 -32/5 +4/5 y + (4/5)(-y -4.5 )\n\n= -2y +4 -32/5 +4/5 y -4/5 y -18/5\n\nCombine terms:\n\n-2y + (4/5 y -4/5 y ) +4 -32/5 -18/5\n\n= -2y +0 + (20/5 -32/5 -18/5 )\n\n= -2y + (-30/5 )\n\n= -2y -6. Which matches the third piece. Correct.\n\nSo the inverse function is x= -2y +4 - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|\n\nBut the problem asks to use absolute value functions to write it as a single equation. The expression we derived uses two absolute values, but that's allowed. However, perhaps we can simplify it further.\n\nAlternatively, factor out the 4/5:\n\nx= -2y +4 + (4/5)( -|y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nBut I don't think this simplifies to a single absolute value. So the answer would be the expression we found:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = -2y +4 - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|\n\nBut wait, the problem says to write the answer as a single equation using absolute value function. Our expression uses two absolute value terms, which is acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to combine them into one absolute value, but I think that's unlikely. The presence of two different critical points (y=8 and y=-4.5) suggests that two absolute values are needed.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there a way to rewrite this expression with a single absolute value? Perhaps not. So the answer would be the above expression. But the problem might expect a different approach, perhaps considering the original function's absolute values and composing the inverse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express the inverse in terms of the original function's structure, but that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, another thought: The original function f(x) is composed of absolute values and linear terms. The inverse function we derived has two absolute values. But perhaps we can write this in terms of a single absolute value by combining the two absolute terms.\n\nLooking at - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|.\n\nFactor out (4/5):\n\n(4/5)( -|y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nBut how can this be expressed as a single absolute value? Let's denote:\n\n-|y -8| + |y +4.5| = |y +4.5| - |y -8|\n\nThis expression is equal to:\n\nFor y \u22658: (y +4.5) - (y -8)=12.5. So constant 12.5.\n\nFor -4.5 \u2264 y <8: (y +4.5) - (8 -y)=2y -3.5.\n\nFor y < -4.5: (-y -4.5) - (8 -y)= -12.5.\n\nSo this expression equals:\n\n12.5 for y \u22658,\n\n2y -3.5 for -4.5 \u2264y <8,\n\n-12.5 for y < -4.5.\n\nBut then, (4/5)(expression) equals:\n\nFor y \u22658: (4/5)*12.5=10.\n\nFor -4.5 \u2264y <8: (4/5)(2y -3.5)= (8y -14)/5.\n\nFor y < -4.5: (4/5)*(-12.5)= -10.\n\nSo the inverse function:\n\nx= -2y +4 + (4/5)( -|y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nIn each region:\n\nFor y >8:\n\nx= -2y +4 +10= -2y +14.\n\nFor -4.5 \u2264y \u22648:\n\nx= -2y +4 + (8y -14)/5.\n\nCalculate:\n\n( -10y +20 +8y -14 )/5 = ( -2y +6 )/5= (6 -2y)/5.\n\nFor y < -4.5:\n\nx= -2y +4 -10= -2y -6.\n\nWhich matches our previous results. So the expression is correct.\n\nBut since the problem asks for a single equation using absolute value functions, our answer is:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = -2y + 4 - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|\n\nAlternatively, factor the 4/5:\n\n= -2y +4 + (4/5)( -|y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nBut we can also write this as:\n\n= -2y +4 + \\frac{4}{5}\\left(|y +4.5| - |y -8|\\right)\n\nMaybe this is acceptable. However, it's still two absolute values. The problem says \"using absolute value function\" which could allow multiple instances. So possibly this is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to write this with a single absolute value expression? For example, suppose we notice that |y +4.5| - |y -8| can be rewritten in terms of another absolute value, but I don't think that's possible in a straightforward way. Therefore, the answer likely requires two absolute values.\n\nThus, the inverse function is:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = -2y +4 + \\frac{4}{5}\\left(|y +4.5| - |y -8|\\right)\n\nBut to write it as a single equation, combine the terms:\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the linear terms:\n\n= -2y +4 + \\frac{4}{5}|y +4.5| - \\frac{4}{5}|y -8|\n\nBut this is the same as the previous expression.\n\nSo the final answer is the expression above. Let me check if this can be simplified further or written more elegantly.\n\nAlternatively, factor out common terms:\n\n= -2y +4 + \\frac{4}{5}(|y +4.5| - |y -8|)\n\nYes, this is how it's written.\n\nTherefore, the inverse function is:\n\nf^{-1}(x) = -2x +4 + \\frac{4}{5}(|x +4.5| - |x -8|)\n\nBut since the problem asks to write the answer as a single equation using absolute value functions, this expression is valid and uses absolute values. So this is the answer.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The function $f(x) = -|x+2| + |x-3| - 0.5x + 2$ is analyzed in three intervals determined by the critical points $x = -2$ and $x = 3$.

  "thinking": "Okay, I need to find the inverse of the function f(x) = -|x+2| + |x-3| - 0.5x + 2 and express it as a single equation using absolute value. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky because of the absolute value terms and the linear part. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find an inverse function, I usually solve the equation y = f(x) for x in terms of y, then swap x and y. But with absolute values, the function might have different expressions depending on the value of x, so I need to consider different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. The absolute value terms here are |x + 2| and |x - 3|. The critical points occur at x = -2 and x = 3. So, the function f(x) will have different expressions in the intervals (-\u221e, -2), [-2, 3), and [3, \u221e).\n\nLet me handle each interval separately.\n\nCase 1: x < -2\nIn this interval, x + 2 is negative, and x - 3 is also negative. So, |x + 2| = -(x + 2) = -x - 2, and |x - 3| = -(x - 3) = -x + 3. Plugging these into f(x):\nf(x) = -(-x -2) + (-x +3) -0.5x +2\nSimplify:\n= x + 2 -x + 3 -0.5x +2\nCombine like terms:\n(x - x -0.5x) + (2 +3 +2) = (-0.5x) +7\nSo f(x) = -0.5x +7 for x < -2.\n\nCase 2: -2 \u2264 x < 3\nHere, x + 2 is non-negative, and x -3 is negative. So |x + 2| = x +2, |x -3| = -x +3. Plugging into f(x):\nf(x) = -(x +2) + (-x +3) -0.5x +2\nSimplify:\n= -x -2 -x +3 -0.5x +2\nCombine terms:\n(-x -x -0.5x) + (-2 +3 +2) = (-2.5x) +3\nSo f(x) = -2.5x +3 for -2 \u2264 x <3.\n\nCase 3: x \u2265 3\nHere, both x +2 and x -3 are non-negative. So |x +2| = x +2, |x -3| =x -3. Plug into f(x):\nf(x) = -(x +2) + (x -3) -0.5x +2\nSimplify:\n= -x -2 +x -3 -0.5x +2\nCombine terms:\n(-x +x -0.5x) + (-2 -3 +2) = (-0.5x) -3\nSo f(x) = -0.5x -3 for x \u22653.\n\nNow I have the piecewise function:\nf(x) = -0.5x +7, x < -2\n       -2.5x +3, -2 \u2264x <3\n       -0.5x -3, x \u22653\n\nNext step is to find the inverse. For each piece, I need to check if they are strictly increasing or decreasing, and whether they are injective (one-to-one) in their intervals.\n\nLooking at the first piece, -0.5x +7. The slope is -0.5, which is negative. So this is a decreasing function. Its domain is x < -2. Let's find its range. As x approaches -2 from the left, the value approaches -0.5*(-2) +7 =1 +7=8. As x approaches -\u221e, the term -0.5x dominates, so f(x) approaches +\u221e. So the range of the first piece is (8, \u221e).\n\nSecond piece: -2.5x +3, slope -2.5, also decreasing. Domain is -2 \u2264x <3. At x = -2, f(x) = -2.5*(-2) +3 =5 +3=8. At x approaching 3 from the left, f(x) approaches -2.5*3 +3= -7.5 +3= -4.5. So the range here is (-4.5, 8].\n\nThird piece: -0.5x -3, slope -0.5, decreasing. Domain x \u22653. At x=3, f(x)= -0.5*3 -3= -1.5 -3= -4.5. As x approaches \u221e, f(x) approaches -\u221e. So the range here is (-\u221e, -4.5].\n\nSo overall, the function f(x) is decreasing over all real numbers because each piece is decreasing, and the ranges connect: (from the first piece) (8, \u221e) then from 8 to -4.5 in the second, then continues decreasing to -\u221e. So the entire function is decreasing, hence strictly monotonic, so injective. Therefore, the inverse exists.\n\nBut wait, even though each piece is decreasing, we have overlapping ranges? Wait, the first piece's range is (8, \u221e), second is (-4.5,8], third is (-\u221e, -4.5]. So when combined, the entire range is (-\u221e, \u221e)? Because the first piece goes from \u221e to 8, the second from 8 down to -4.5, then third from -4.5 to -\u221e. Wait, but that would mean the function's range is all real numbers. Because between \u221e and 8 (from first piece), 8 to -4.5 (second), and then -4.5 to -\u221e (third). So for any real y, there exists an x such that f(x)=y. Therefore, the inverse function is defined for all real y.\n\nTherefore, the inverse function f^{-1}(y) will have different expressions depending on the value of y.\n\nLet me find the inverse for each piece.\n\nFor the first piece: y = -0.5x +7, x < -2.\nSolve for x:\ny = -0.5x +7\n=> -0.5x = y -7\n=> x = (7 - y)/0.5\n=> x = 14 - 2y\n\nBut in this case, the original x was < -2. So the corresponding y is in (8, \u221e). Therefore, when solving for x in terms of y, we have x =14 -2y, but we need to ensure that this x is < -2. Let's see:\n\nx =14 -2y < -2\n=>14 -2y < -2\n=> -2y < -16\n=> y >8. Which is exactly the range for this piece. So the inverse here is x =14 -2y, for y >8.\n\nSecond piece: y = -2.5x +3, -2 \u2264x <3. Range is (-4.5,8].\n\nSolve for x:\ny = -2.5x +3\n=> -2.5x = y -3\n=>x = (3 - y)/2.5\n=> x = (3 - y)/(5/2)\n=> x = (2/5)(3 - y) = (6 -2y)/5\n\nAnd this x must satisfy -2 \u2264x <3. Let's check the corresponding y:\n\nOriginal x is between -2 and 3. Let's see when x = -2, y =8, and when x approaches 3, y approaches -4.5. So for y between (-4.5,8], x is (6 -2y)/5. Let's verify the domain for x here. For example, when y =8, x= (6 -16)/5=(-10)/5=-2, which matches. When y approaches -4.5 from above, x approaches (6 -2*(-4.5))/5 = (6 +9)/5=15/5=3, which is the upper limit. So yes, this is correct.\n\nThird piece: y = -0.5x -3, x \u22653. Solve for x:\ny = -0.5x -3\n=> -0.5x = y +3\n=>x = (-3 - y)/0.5\n=>x = (-3 - y)/(1/2)\n=>x = -2(3 + y) = -6 -2y\n\nBut original x here is \u22653, so let's check:\n\nx = -6 -2y \u22653\n=> -6 -2y \u22653\n=> -2y \u22659\n=> y \u2264 -4.5. Which is the range for this piece. So inverse here is x = -6 -2y for y \u2264-4.5.\n\nTherefore, the inverse function is piecewise:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = 14 -2y, y >8\n          (6 -2y)/5, -4.5 < y \u22648\n          -6 -2y, y \u2264-4.5\n\nBut the problem asks to write the answer as a single equation using absolute value functions. So I need to combine these three pieces into a single expression with absolute values.\n\nHmm. Let's see. Each piece is a linear function, and the breakpoints are at y=8 and y=-4.5. Maybe I can express it using absolute values that activate depending on the value of y.\n\nAlternatively, think about how to combine the three cases into one formula. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inverse can be written in terms of expressions involving |y - a| or |y + b|. Let me see.\n\nBut this is challenging. Let's analyze the inverse function expressions:\n\nFor y >8: x =14 -2y\n\nFor y between -4.5 and8: x=(6 -2y)/5\n\nFor y <=-4.5: x= -6 -2y\n\nSo these are three linear segments. To write this as a single equation with absolute values, perhaps we can find a combination of absolute values that correspond to these linear pieces.\n\nAlternatively, express the inverse function as a linear combination plus some absolute value terms that adjust based on the intervals.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the middle piece first. The middle inverse is (6 -2y)/5. The other two pieces are 14 -2y and -6 -2y. Let's see how these relate.\n\nThe slopes of the inverse functions are:\n\nFor y >8: slope -2\n\nFor middle: slope -2/5 \u2248 -0.4\n\nFor y <=-4.5: slope -2\n\nSo the left and right pieces have the same slope, steeper than the middle. So perhaps the inverse function can be represented as a combination of a linear term and absolute value terms that adjust the slope in certain intervals.\n\nAlternatively, since the inverse function has different expressions depending on whether y is above 8, between -4.5 and8, or below -4.5, maybe we can write expressions involving |y -8| and |y +4.5|.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, note that the inverse function in the middle region can be written as (6 -2y)/5. Let's see if that can be represented as a combination of terms. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we have a linear term and then add or subtract some absolute values. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, observe that the inverse function for the middle piece is x = (6 -2y)/5, which is the same as x = - (2y -6)/5. Let's see if this can be connected to the other pieces.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire inverse function as:\n\nx = -2y + C + D*|y - A| + E*|y - B|\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to express the piecewise function as a single equation.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that the inverse function has two breakpoints at y=8 and y=-4.5. The absolute value functions can be used to handle these breakpoints.\n\nLet me consider the difference between the middle expression and the other expressions. For example, when y >8, the inverse is 14 -2y. Let's see how this relates to the middle expression when y=8: (6 -2*8)/5 = (6 -16)/5 = (-10)/5 = -2. Wait, but 14 -2*8=14-16=-2. So at y=8, both expressions give x=-2. Similarly, at y=-4.5, the middle expression gives (6 -2*(-4.5))/5=(6 +9)/5=15/5=3. The third piece gives x=-6 -2*(-4.5)= -6 +9=3. So they agree at the breakpoints.\n\nThis suggests that the inverse function is continuous. Now, to write this as a single equation, maybe express the inverse as a combination of the middle term plus adjustments based on whether y is above 8 or below -4.5.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following approach. Since the inverse function for y >8 is x =14 -2y, which can also be written as x= (6 -2y)/5 + (14 -2y - (6 -2y)/5). Let's compute that:\n\n(6 -2y)/5 + ( (5*(14 -2y) - (6 -2y)) /5 )\n= (6 -2y)/5 + (70 -10y -6 +2y)/5\n= (6 -2y)/5 + (64 -8y)/5\n= (6 -2y +64 -8y)/5\n= (70 -10y)/5\n=14 -2y, which matches.\n\nBut this seems convoluted. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the inverse function can be represented as x = A*y + B + C*|y -8| + D*|y +4.5|\n\nBut how to find A, B, C, D?\n\nWait, let's look at the three pieces:\n\n1. For y >8: x =14 -2y\n\n2. For -4.5 <y \u22648: x=(6 -2y)/5\n\n3. For y \u2264-4.5: x=-6 -2y\n\nWe need to express these three as a single formula. Let's denote that in regions where y >8 or y < -4.5, we have terms that adjust the middle expression.\n\nCompare the middle expression (6 -2y)/5 with the other two:\n\nWhen y >8, the difference between 14 -2y and (6 -2y)/5 is:\n\n14 -2y - (6 -2y)/5 = (70 -10y -6 +2y)/5 = (64 -8y)/5 = (8*(8 -y))/5.\n\nBut y >8 here, so (8 - y) is negative, but this might relate to an absolute value.\n\nSimilarly, when y < -4.5, the difference between -6 -2y and (6 -2y)/5 is:\n\n-6 -2y - (6 -2y)/5 = (-30 -10y -6 +2y)/5 = (-36 -8y)/5 = (-4*(9 + 2y))/5.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the inverse function as a combination of the middle term plus terms that are proportional to the absolute values of (y -8) and (y +4.5), but in such a way that they only contribute when y is beyond those points.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we write:\n\nx = (6 -2y)/5 + K*|y -8| + L*|y +4.5|\n\nWe need to find K and L such that:\n\n- For y >8: x = (6 -2y)/5 + K*(y -8) + L*0 (since y +4.5 >0 here). This should equal 14 -2y.\n\nSo:\n\n(6 -2y)/5 + K*(y -8) =14 -2y\n\nMultiply through by 5 to eliminate denominator:\n\n6 -2y +5K(y -8) =70 -10y\n\nExpand:\n\n6 -2y +5K y -40K =70 -10y\n\nGroup like terms:\n\n(-2y +5K y) + (6 -40K) =70 -10y\n\nFactor y:\n\ny(-2 +5K) + (6 -40K) =70 -10y\n\nCompare coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of y: -2 +5K = -10 \u2192 5K = -8 \u2192 K= -8/5\n\nConstant term:6 -40K =70\n\nSubstitute K= -8/5:\n\n6 -40*(-8/5) =6 + 64=70. Which holds.\n\nSo K= -8/5.\n\nSimilarly, for y \u2264-4.5:\n\nx = (6 -2y)/5 + K*|y -8| + L*|y +4.5|\n\nBut here, y \u2264-4.5, so |y -8|=8 -y, and |y +4.5|= -y -4.5.\n\nSo:\n\nx= (6 -2y)/5 + (-8/5)*(8 -y) + L*(-y -4.5)\n\nThis should equal -6 -2y.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n(6 -2y)/5 + (-8/5)(8 -y) + L*(-y -4.5) = -6 -2y\n\nMultiply through by 5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6 -2y -8*(8 -y) +5L*(-y -4.5) = -30 -10y\n\nCompute:\n\n6 -2y -64 +8y +5L*(-y -4.5) = -30 -10y\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n( -2y +8y ) + (6 -64) +5L*(-y -4.5) = -30 -10y\n\n6y -58 +5L*(-y -4.5) = -30 -10y\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n6y -58 +5L*(-y -4.5) +30 +10y =0\n\n16y -28 +5L*(-y -4.5)=0\n\nFactor terms:\n\n16y -28 -5L y -22.5L =0\n\nGroup variables:\n\ny(16 -5L) + (-28 -22.5L)=0\n\nFor this equation to hold for all y \u2264-4.5, coefficients must be zero:\n\n16 -5L =0 \u2192 5L=16 \u2192 L=16/5=3.2\n\nAnd:\n\n-28 -22.5L=0 \u2192 -28 -22.5*(16/5)= -28 -72= -100 \u22600.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So this approach might not work. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need a different setup. Perhaps instead, include two absolute terms, each active in one of the outer regions.\n\nAlternatively, think about the inverse function's form. Let me look at the expressions again.\n\nFirst piece: x=14 -2y (y>8)\n\nSecond: x=(6 -2y)/5 ( -4.5<y\u22648 )\n\nThird: x= -6 -2y (y\u2264-4.5 )\n\nMaybe express x in terms of y and the maximum or minimum functions. But the problem requires using absolute values. Alternatively, use the fact that for any real number a, |a| = a if a\u22650 and -a otherwise. So we can express the different cases using absolute values.\n\nAnother approach: The inverse function changes its formula at y=8 and y=-4.5. Let's denote that the inverse function can be written as x = A*y + B + C*|y -8| + D*|y +4.5|. We can set up equations based on the three cases to solve for A, B, C, D.\n\nBut with four variables and three equations (one for each piece), it might be underdetermined. Alternatively, perhaps it can be expressed with fewer terms. Let me see.\n\nWait, notice that the slopes in the first and third pieces are both -2, while the middle is -2/5. The difference in slope between the middle and the outer regions is (-2) - (-2/5) = -8/5. So perhaps the term involving |y -8| and |y +4.5| can adjust the slope by -8/5 when y is outside the middle interval.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAssume that x = (-2/5)y + (6/5) + K*( |y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nWait, but this might not work. Alternatively, think of the function as:\n\nx = a*y + b + c*|y -8| + d*|y +4.5|\n\nThen, in the middle interval (-4.5 <y \u22648), both |y -8| =8 -y and |y +4.5|=y +4.5. So x would be:\n\nx= a*y + b + c*(8 -y) + d*(y +4.5 )\n\n= (a -c +d ) y + b +8c +4.5d\n\nWhich should equal (6 -2y)/5. Therefore:\n\nCoefficient of y: (a -c +d ) = -2/5\n\nConstant term: b +8c +4.5d =6/5\n\nFor the first interval y >8, |y -8|=y -8, |y +4.5|=y +4.5. So:\n\nx= a*y + b + c*(y -8) + d*(y +4.5 )\n\n= (a +c +d ) y + b -8c +4.5d\n\nThis should equal 14 -2y. So:\n\nCoefficient: a +c +d = -2\n\nConstant term: b -8c +4.5d =14\n\nFor the third interval y \u2264-4.5, |y -8|=8 -y, |y +4.5|=-y -4.5. So:\n\nx= a*y + b + c*(8 -y) + d*(-y -4.5 )\n\n= (a -c -d ) y + b +8c -4.5d\n\nThis should equal -6 -2y. So:\n\nCoefficient: a -c -d = -2\n\nConstant term: b +8c -4.5d =-6\n\nNow, we have three systems from the three cases:\n\nFrom the middle interval:\n\n1. a -c +d = -2/5\n\n2. b +8c +4.5d =6/5\n\nFrom the first interval:\n\n3. a +c +d = -2\n\n4. b -8c +4.5d =14\n\nFrom the third interval:\n\n5. a -c -d =-2\n\n6. b +8c -4.5d =-6\n\nNow, we have three equations for a, b, c, d. Let me see if this system is solvable.\n\nFirst, let's handle the equations for a:\n\nFrom equations 1 and3 and5.\n\nEquation1: a -c +d =-2/5\n\nEquation3: a +c +d = -2\n\nEquation5: a -c -d =-2\n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation3:\n\n(a +c +d) - (a -c +d ) = -2 - (-2/5 )\n\n=> 2c = -2 +2/5 = -10/5 + 2/5= -8/5 \u2192 c= -4/5.\n\nNow, subtract equation1 from equation5:\n\n(a -c -d ) - (a -c +d ) = -2 - (-2/5 )\n\n=> -2d = -2 +2/5 = -10/5 +2/5= -8/5 \u2192 d= 4/5.\n\nNow, substitute c= -4/5 and d=4/5 into equation1:\n\na - (-4/5) +4/5 =-2/5 \u2192 a +4/5 +4/5= a +8/5= -2/5 \u2192 a= -2/5 -8/5= -10/5= -2.\n\nSo a= -2. Check with equation3:\n\na +c +d= -2 + (-4/5) +4/5= -2 +0= -2, which matches equation3. Good.\n\nSimilarly, equation5: a -c -d= -2 -(-4/5) -4/5= -2 +4/5 -4/5= -2, which matches equation5. Good.\n\nNow, we have a= -2, c= -4/5, d=4/5. Now solve for b using equations2,4,6.\n\nEquation2: b +8c +4.5d =6/5\n\nSubstitute c= -4/5, d=4/5:\n\nb +8*(-4/5) +4.5*(4/5) =6/5\n\nCalculate:\n\nb -32/5 + 18/5 =6/5\n\nb -14/5=6/5 \u2192 b=6/5 +14/5=20/5=4.\n\nEquation4: b -8c +4.5d=14\n\nSubstitute c= -4/5, d=4/5, b=4:\n\n4 -8*(-4/5) +4.5*(4/5)=4 +32/5 +18/5=4 +50/5=4 +10=14. Correct.\n\nEquation6: b +8c -4.5d= -6\n\nSubstitute:\n\n4 +8*(-4/5) -4.5*(4/5)=4 -32/5 -18/5=4 -50/5=4 -10= -6. Correct.\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied. Therefore, the inverse function can be written as:\n\nx= a*y +b +c*|y -8| +d*|y +4.5|\n\nSubstituting a=-2, b=4, c=-4/5, d=4/5:\n\nx= -2y +4 - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|\n\nThis combines all three pieces into a single equation. Let me verify with each interval.\n\nFor y >8:\n\nx= -2y +4 - (4/5)(y -8) + (4/5)(y +4.5 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -2y +4 - (4/5)y +32/5 + (4/5)y +18/5\n\nCombine terms:\n\n-2y +4 + ( -4/5 y +4/5 y ) + (32/5 +18/5 )\n\n= -2y +4 +0 +50/5\n\n= -2y +4 +10\n\n= -2y +14. Which matches the first piece. Correct.\n\nFor y between -4.5 and8:\n\nx= -2y +4 - (4/5)(8 -y) + (4/5)(y +4.5 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -2y +4 - (32/5 -4/5 y ) + (4/5 y + 18/5 )\n\n= -2y +4 -32/5 +4/5 y +4/5 y +18/5\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(-2y +4/5 y +4/5 y ) + (4 -32/5 +18/5 )\n\n= (-2y +8/5 y ) + (20/5 -32/5 +18/5 )\n\n= (-10/5 y +8/5 y ) + (6/5 )\n\n= (-2/5 y ) +6/5\n\n= (6 -2y)/5. Which matches the middle piece. Correct.\n\nFor y \u2264-4.5:\n\nx= -2y +4 - (4/5)(8 -y) + (4/5)(-y -4.5 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -2y +4 -32/5 +4/5 y + (4/5)(-y -4.5 )\n\n= -2y +4 -32/5 +4/5 y -4/5 y -18/5\n\nCombine terms:\n\n-2y + (4/5 y -4/5 y ) +4 -32/5 -18/5\n\n= -2y +0 + (20/5 -32/5 -18/5 )\n\n= -2y + (-30/5 )\n\n= -2y -6. Which matches the third piece. Correct.\n\nSo the inverse function is x= -2y +4 - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|\n\nBut the problem asks to use absolute value functions to write it as a single equation. The expression we derived uses two absolute values, but that's allowed. However, perhaps we can simplify it further.\n\nAlternatively, factor out the 4/5:\n\nx= -2y +4 + (4/5)( -|y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nBut I don't think this simplifies to a single absolute value. So the answer would be the expression we found:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = -2y +4 - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|\n\nBut wait, the problem says to write the answer as a single equation using absolute value function. Our expression uses two absolute value terms, which is acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to combine them into one absolute value, but I think that's unlikely. The presence of two different critical points (y=8 and y=-4.5) suggests that two absolute values are needed.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there a way to rewrite this expression with a single absolute value? Perhaps not. So the answer would be the above expression. But the problem might expect a different approach, perhaps considering the original function's absolute values and composing the inverse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express the inverse in terms of the original function's structure, but that's not straightforward.\n\nWait, another thought: The original function f(x) is composed of absolute values and linear terms. The inverse function we derived has two absolute values. But perhaps we can write this in terms of a single absolute value by combining the two absolute terms.\n\nLooking at - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|.\n\nFactor out (4/5):\n\n(4/5)( -|y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nBut how can this be expressed as a single absolute value? Let's denote:\n\n-|y -8| + |y +4.5| = |y +4.5| - |y -8|\n\nThis expression is equal to:\n\nFor y \u22658: (y +4.5) - (y -8)=12.5. So constant 12.5.\n\nFor -4.5 \u2264 y <8: (y +4.5) - (8 -y)=2y -3.5.\n\nFor y < -4.5: (-y -4.5) - (8 -y)= -12.5.\n\nSo this expression equals:\n\n12.5 for y \u22658,\n\n2y -3.5 for -4.5 \u2264y <8,\n\n-12.5 for y < -4.5.\n\nBut then, (4/5)(expression) equals:\n\nFor y \u22658: (4/5)*12.5=10.\n\nFor -4.5 \u2264y <8: (4/5)(2y -3.5)= (8y -14)/5.\n\nFor y < -4.5: (4/5)*(-12.5)= -10.\n\nSo the inverse function:\n\nx= -2y +4 + (4/5)( -|y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nIn each region:\n\nFor y >8:\n\nx= -2y +4 +10= -2y +14.\n\nFor -4.5 \u2264y \u22648:\n\nx= -2y +4 + (8y -14)/5.\n\nCalculate:\n\n( -10y +20 +8y -14 )/5 = ( -2y +6 )/5= (6 -2y)/5.\n\nFor y < -4.5:\n\nx= -2y +4 -10= -2y -6.\n\nWhich matches our previous results. So the expression is correct.\n\nBut since the problem asks for a single equation using absolute value functions, our answer is:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = -2y + 4 - (4/5)|y -8| + (4/5)|y +4.5|\n\nAlternatively, factor the 4/5:\n\n= -2y +4 + (4/5)( -|y -8| + |y +4.5| )\n\nBut we can also write this as:\n\n= -2y +4 + \\frac{4}{5}\\left(|y +4.5| - |y -8|\\right)\n\nMaybe this is acceptable. However, it's still two absolute values. The problem says \"using absolute value function\" which could allow multiple instances. So possibly this is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to write this with a single absolute value expression? For example, suppose we notice that |y +4.5| - |y -8| can be rewritten in terms of another absolute value, but I don't think that's possible in a straightforward way. Therefore, the answer likely requires two absolute values.\n\nThus, the inverse function is:\n\nf^{-1}(y) = -2y +4 + \\frac{4}{5}\\left(|y +4.5| - |y -8|\\right)\n\nBut to write it as a single equation, combine the terms:\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine the linear terms:\n\n= -2y +4 + \\frac{4}{5}|y +4.5| - \\frac{4}{5}|y -8|\n\nBut this is the same as the previous expression.\n\nSo the final answer is the expression above. Let me check if this can be simplified further or written more elegantly.\n\nAlternatively, factor out common terms:\n\n= -2y +4 + \\frac{4}{5}(|y +4.5| - |y -8|)\n\nYes, this is how it's written.\n\nTherefore, the inverse function is:\n\nf^{-1}(x) = -2x +4 + \\frac{4}{5}(|x +4.5| - |x -8|)\n\nBut since the problem asks to write the answer as a single equation using absolute value functions, this expression is valid and uses absolute values. So this is the answer.",
