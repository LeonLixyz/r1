  "question": "What kind of species is a 'Snark'?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking what kind of species a 'Snark' is. Let me think. I remember hearing the term 'Snark' before, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, there's a poem by Lewis Carroll called \"The Hunting of the Snark.\" Right, that's it! In the poem, the Snark is a fictional creature. The characters go on a quest to find it, but it's described in a whimsical and nonsensical way, typical of Carroll's style like in \"Jabberwocky.\" So the Snark isn't a real animal. The poem might have some metaphorical meanings, but biologically, the Snark doesn't exist. So the answer should be that it's a fictional creature from literature. Let me double-check. Are there any real species named Snark? Maybe a typo for shark or snake? No, Snark in literature is definitely fictional. So the answer is fictional or mythical. The options probably include that.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The 'Snark' is a fictional creature from Lewis Carroll's 1874 poem \"The Hunting of the Snark.\" It is depicted as a mysterious and elusive being with whimsical traits, embodying the nonsensical and absurd themes characteristic of Carroll's works. There is no biological species known as a Snark in reality.\n\nAnswer: A fictional creature from Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark\"  \nConfidence: 100%",
