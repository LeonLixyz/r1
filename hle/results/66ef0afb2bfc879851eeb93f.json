  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about finding the maximum length of a secret message encrypted in the Ching book using characters from the Shu. So, I need to figure out how much data can be encoded with the symbols in Ching, and how that translates into characters from Shu.\n\nFirst, the Ching has exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing. Each symbol is a combination like yin-water or yang-fire. Let's break that down. The yin and yang are two possibilities, and the wuxing elements are five: water, fire, wood, metal, earth. So each symbol is a combination of one of two (yin/yang) and one of five elements. That gives 2 * 5 = 10 possible unique symbols. Wait, but if each symbol in Ching is one of these 10 types, then each symbol can be represented with a number from 0 to 9, right? Because 10 possibilities can be stored in log2(10) \u2248 3.32 bits. But since each symbol is one of 10, maybe each symbol can encode log2(10) bits of information. But maybe the encryption uses each symbol to represent a digit in base 10. Like, each symbol is a digit 0-9. Then 9999 symbols would form a 4-digit number (since 9999 is four digits) but wait, 9999 symbols would allow for a number up to 10^9999 -1, which is a really big number. But how does this relate to the Shu's characters?\n\nThe Shu has 3000 characters but uses only 120 most common ones. So the message is written using those 120 characters. So each character in the message can be represented as one of 120 possibilities. To represent each character, how many bits do we need? Let's calculate log2(120). That's about 6.906, so 7 bits per character. Alternatively, since 2^7=128 which can cover 120. So each character would require 7 bits.\n\nNow, the Ching's symbols are 9999 in total. If each symbol can encode, say, one of 10 possibilities, then the total number of bits would be 9999 * log2(10) \u2248 9999 * 3.3219 \u2248 33,219 bits. Then, the number of characters possible from Shu's 120 would be the total bits divided by bits per character. So 33,219 /7 \u2248 4745.57. So about 4745 characters maximum. But wait, maybe there's another way. If each Ching symbol can encode a digit in base 10, then 9999 digits would form a number with 9999 digits in base 10. Then that number can be converted into base 120 to see how many digits it has, which would correspond to the number of characters. Because converting from base 10 to base 120 would give the number of characters needed.\n\nSo the maximum message length would be the number of base-120 digits that the Ching's 9999-digit base-10 number can represent. Let me think. The maximum value representable by 9999 digits in base 10 is 10^9999 -1. Then converting that to base 120, the number of digits would be floor(log_120 (10^9999 -1)) +1. Since log_120(10^9999) is log10(10^9999)/log10(120) = 9999/(log10(120)). Let's compute log10(120). Log10(100)=2, log10(120)=~2.07918. So 9999 / 2.07918 \u2248 9999 /2.079 \u2248 approx 4807. So that's about 4807 digits in base 120, which would correspond to the message length. So the maximum length is 4807. But wait, the options aren't given, but the answer should be 4807. But let me check.\n\nAlternatively, since each symbol in Ching can represent 10 possibilities, the total number of possible combinations is 10^9999. To represent this in terms of Shu's 120 characters, each character is a choice of 120, so the number of characters needed is the largest integer n where 120^n <= 10^9999. Taking logarithms: n <= log_120(10^9999) = 9999 * log_120(10). As log_120(10) is (ln10)/(ln120) \u2248 2.302585/(4.787492) \u2248 0.4807. So 9999 * 0.4807 \u2248 9999*0.48 \u2248 4807. So n\u22484807. So the maximum length is 4807. So the answer is 4807. \n\nBut wait, let's make sure. Because in information theory, the entropy would be log2(10^9999) = 9999 * log2(10) \u2248 9999 *3.3219\u224833,219 bits. The number of characters possible with 120 options is 33,219 / log2(120) \u224833,219 /6.906\u22484813. That's a different number. Hmm. So which approach is correct?\n\nAh, here's the confusion. If we model each Ching symbol as providing log2(10) bits, then total bits is around 33,219. Then, each Shu character requires log2(120) bits. So the total number of characters is 33,219 / log2(120) \u2248 33,219 /6.906\u22484813. But wait, this would give a different answer. So which is the right way?\n\nAlternatively, if we treat the entire sequence of Ching symbols as a single number in base 10, and then convert that number to base 120, the number of digits in base 120 would be floor(log_120(N)) +1, where N is 10^9999-1. But N is approximately 10^9999. So log_120(10^9999) is 9999 * log_120(10) \u2248 9999 * (1 / log_10(120)) ) = 9999 / 2.079 \u22484807. Thus, the number of digits in base 120 would be 4807. So answer is 4807.\n\nBut when using the information-theoretic approach, it's about 4813. So why the discrepancy?\n\nThe difference arises because the two methods treat the encoding differently. One is using the numeral system conversion (base 10 to base 120), which gives 4807. The other is using the entropy in bits, which gives a higher number. But the problem states that the Ching's symbols are used to encrypt the message. The way encryption is done here would determine which approach is correct. For example, if each symbol is considered a digit in a base-10 number, then converting that number into base-120 would give the number of characters. Alternatively, if each symbol is treated as a separate unit that can encode information, then maybe using entropy.\n\nBut the problem says the message is encrypted using the Ching's symbols. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the entire sequence of symbols as a number in base 10 (since each symbol has 10 possibilities), then express that number in base 120, which would give the number of characters. For example, if you have a number in base 10, say 9999 digits, the maximum value is 10^9999 -1. Converting that to base 120 would require log_120(10^9999) digits. Which is 9999 * log_10(10)/log_10(120) = 9999 / log10(120) \u2248 9999 /2.07918\u22484807.5. So floor(4807.5) is 4807, but when you add 1 (since the formula is floor(log(N)) +1), but wait, if N is 10^9999, then log_120(N) is exactly 9999 / log10(120). So the exact value is 9999 / log10(120) \u22484807.5. So floor(4807.5) =4807, then +1 gives 4808? Wait, no. Wait, no. Let's think again. The formula for the number of digits in base b for a number N is floor(log_b(N)) +1. If N is 10^9999, then log_b(N) = log_120(10^9999) = 9999 * log_120(10) =9999 / log_10(120) \u22484807.5. So floor(4807.5) is 4807, then +1 gives 4808. But wait, but 10^9999 in base 120 would have 4808 digits? Wait, but 120^4807 is less than 10^9999, and 120^4808 is greater than 10^9999. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nSuppose 120^4807.5 = 10^9999. Because log_120(10^9999) =4807.5. So 10^9999 =120^4807.5. So the number is equal to 120^4807.5. Thus, when converting 10^9999 to base 120, the number of digits would be the exponent's ceiling? Wait, no. Let me think with a smaller example. For example, if we have 10^3 =1000 in base 10. Convert to base 2: 1111101000, which is 10 bits. But log2(1000)= ~9.965, so floor(9.965)=9, +1=10. Which matches. So for 10^9999, log_120(10^9999)=4807.5. So floor(4807.5)=4807, then +1=4808. Therefore, the number of digits in base 120 is 4808. But wait, but 120^4808 is way larger than 10^9999. Wait, 120^4808 = (10^log10(120))^4808 =10^{4808 * log10(120)}. Since log10(120)\u22482.07918, 4808*2.07918\u22484808*2=9616, plus 4808*0.07918\u2248380. So total ~9616+380\u22489996. So 120^4808\u224810^9996, which is much less than 10^9999. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Wait, log10(120)\u22482.07918, so 4808 *2.07918\u22484808*2 +4808*0.07918\u22489616 + ~380.8\u224810,000. So 120^4808\u224810^10,000. But 10^9999 is 10^10,000 /10. So 120^4808 is larger than 10^9999. So 10^9999 < 120^4808. Therefore, 10^9999 in base 120 would have 4808 digits. But the maximum possible number in 4808 digits in base 120 is 120^4808 -1. Since 10^9999 is less than that, but how many digits does it have? For the number 10^9999 -1, which is the maximum number with 9999 digits in base 10. So converting that to base 120, the number of digits would be floor(log_120(10^9999 -1)) +1. Since 10^9999 -1 is less than 10^9999, which is less than 120^4808, so log_120(10^9999 -1) is slightly less than 4808, so floor would give 4807, +1 =4808. But maybe in reality, the exact calculation would require more precise math.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is the entropy one. Let's see. Each Ching symbol can represent 10 possibilities, so 9999 symbols can encode 10^9999 possibilities. The Shu has 120 characters, so the number of possible messages of length L is 120^L. We need to find the maximum L where 120^L <=10^9999. Solving for L: L <= log_120(10^9999) =9999 * log_120(10). Which is the same as before. So L= floor(9999 * log_10(10)/log_10(120)) ). Which is floor(9999 / 2.07918)\u2248 floor(4807.5)=4807. So maximum L is 4807. But wait, but 120^4807 = (10^{log10(120)})^4807 =10^{4807 * 2.07918}\u224810^{4807*2 +4807*0.07918}\u224810^(9614 + 380)\u224810^9994. So 10^9994 is less than 10^9999. So 120^4807 is 10^9994, which is much smaller than 10^9999. Then 120^4807 <10^9999, so 4807 is possible. What about 4807 +1=4808? Let's check 120^4808=120*120^4807\u2248120*10^9994\u22481.2*10^9996, which is still less than 10^9999 (which is 1e9999). Wait, but 1.2e9996 is way smaller than 1e9999. So even 4808 is way too small. Hmm, this seems contradictory. Wait, no, wait. The calculation earlier was that log_120(10^9999)=4807.5. So 120^4807.5=10^9999. So 120^4807=10^9999 / sqrt(120). Which is approximately 10^9999 / 10.95 \u2248 10^9998. So 120^4807 is about 1e9998, and 120^4808 is 1.2e9998 *120 =1.44e10000, which is larger than 1e9999. Wait, this math isn't adding up. The confusion here is that exponentiation isn't linear. Let's get back to the logarithm approach. Let me compute log_120(10^9999) = ln(10^9999)/ln(120) =9999*ln10 / ln(120). Compute that:\n\nln(10)=2.302585093\nln(120)=4.787491743\n\nSo 9999 * 2.302585093 /4.787491743 \u2248 9999*(0.4807)\u22489999*0.4807\u22484807.5\n\nSo the exponent is 4807.5, meaning that 120^4807.5=10^9999. So the maximum integer L where 120^L <=10^9999 is L= floor(4807.5)=4807. Because 120^4807 <10^9999 and 120^4808 >10^9999. Wait, no. If 120^4807.5=10^9999, then 120^4807=10^9999 / sqrt(120)\u224810^9999 / 10.954\u22489.13e9998. Which is much less than 10^9999. So 120^4807.5=1e9999, so 120^4807 =1e9999 / 120^0.5\u22481e9999 / 10.954\u22489.13e9998. So 120^4807 is 9.13e9998, which is less than 1e9999. Therefore, 120^4807 is less than 10^9999. Then 120^4808=120^4807 *120=9.13e9998*120\u22481.0956e10001. Which is greater than 1e9999. Therefore, the maximum L is 4807. Because 120^4807 is less than 10^9999, and 120^(4807+1)=120^4808 is greater than 10^9999. Therefore, the maximum L is 4807. So the answer is 4807.\n\nBut earlier when using the base conversion approach, we thought it might be 4808 digits. Wait, the formula says floor(log_b(N)) +1. So for N=10^9999, which is exactly 120^4807.5. So floor(log_120(N))=4807. Then +1 would be 4808. Therefore, when converting the number 10^9999 to base 120, it would have 4808 digits. But 120^4808 is larger than 10^9999, so how can that be? For example, the number 10 in base 10 is '10', which is 2 digits. To convert to base 2: 1010, which is 4 digits. log2(10)=3.32, floor(3.32)=3, +1=4. Which matches. So for N=10^9999, converting to base 120, the number of digits is 4808. But this would require that the number 10^9999 can be represented in 4808 digits in base 120. But since 120^4808 is much larger than 10^9999, the first digit would be something less than 120. For example, the maximum number with 4808 digits in base 120 is 120^4808 -1. So 10^9999 is less than that. Therefore, the number of digits needed is 4808. But that would mean that the maximum message length is 4808 characters. However, according to the previous calculation, the maximum L where 120^L <=10^9999 is 4807. Because 120^4807.5=10^9999, so 120^4807=10^9999 / 120^0.5\u22489.13e9998 <1e9999, so 120^4807 <1e9999, hence L=4807 would satisfy 120^4807 <=1e9999. But wait, 1e9999 is 10^9999, which is the number of possible combinations of Ching's symbols. So the message length L must satisfy 120^L <=10^9999. Solving for L gives L= floor( log_120(10^9999) )= floor(4807.5)=4807. Hence, the max message length is 4807.\n\nWait, but in base conversion, the number of digits would be 4808, which allows for numbers up to 120^4808 -1, which is way larger than 10^9999. So that's a different approach. Which is correct?\n\nThe crux is whether the encryption uses each Ching symbol as a base-10 digit, so that the entire sequence is a base-10 number, which is then converted to base-120 (Shu's characters). In that case, the number of digits in base-120 would be 4808, but since the actual value is 10^9999, which is less than 120^4808, the leading digits would be zero, but you can't have leading zeros in a number. Wait, no. For example, consider converting the number 1000 (base 10) to base 120. Let's see:\n\n1000 divided by 120: 1000 /120 =8.333... So the first digit (from right) is 1000 %120=40, then 8.333, which is 8*120=960, so next digit is 8. So the number would be [8,40] in base 120. But wait, 8*120 +40= 960+40=1000. So in base 120, it's written as two digits: 8 and 40. So the number of digits is 2. Here, log_120(1000)=log(1000)/log(120)=3/2.079\u22481.44, floor(1.44)=1, +1=2. Which matches. \n\nSo converting 10^9999 to base 120 would require 4808 digits, and since 10^9999 is less than 120^4808, the first digit would be non-zero. So the number of characters (digits) needed is 4808. Therefore, the maximum message length would be 4808. \n\nBut this contradicts the previous approach where using 120^L <=10^9999 gives L=4807. So which is correct?\n\nLet me take a smaller example. Let's say we have 10^3=1000 in base 10, and we convert it to base 120. As in the example above, it would take 2 digits (8 and 40). Which is floor(log_120(1000)) +1 = floor(1.44) +1=1+1=2. But 120^2=14400 >1000. So the maximum L where 120^L <=1000 is L=1, since 120^1=120<=1000, and 120^2=14400>1000. So according to that, the maximum message length would be 1. But when converting 1000 to base 120, you get two digits. So this seems contradictory.\n\nAh, here's the key. If the message can be represented as a number in base 120, then the number of digits is floor(log_120(N)) +1. However, the maximum L such that 120^L <=N is floor(log_120(N)). But since the message can use all possible combinations, including leading zeros, but in reality, leading zeros would not be allowed as they don't contribute to the value. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct messages (without leading zeros) is 120^L - (120^(L) - N) if N<120^L. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the maximum possible message length. Each character in the message is one of 120, so each position in the message can have 120 possibilities. The total number of possible messages of length L is 120^L. The total number of possible combinations from Ching is 10^9999. So the maximum L where 120^L <=10^9999. Solving for L:\n\nL = floor( log_120(10^9999) ) = floor( 9999 * log_10(10)/ log_10(120) ) = floor(9999 /2.07918)\u2248 floor(4807.5)=4807.\n\nTherefore, the maximum L is 4807. Because 120^4807 <=10^9999 <120^4808. So the message can be up to 4807 characters long. The base conversion approach gives 4808 digits, but that's because the first digit can be zero. But if the message cannot have leading zeros (assuming that the first character must be non-zero), then the actual number of possible messages of length 4808 would be 119*120^(4807). Which is 119*120^4807 <120^4808=120*120^4807=119*120^4807 +120^4807 >10^9999. So even if leading zeros are allowed, 120^4808 >10^9999, so you can't have messages of length 4808. Therefore, the maximum possible L is 4807.\n\nSo the correct answer is 4807. Therefore, the explanation is that each Ching symbol provides 10 possibilities, so total possibilities are 10^9999. Each Shu character provides 120 possibilities. The maximum message length is the largest L where 120^L <=10^9999. Solving gives L=4807.\n\nNow, the other parts of the question, like the computer vision tool's time and computation times, seem to be irrelevant here. The question is about the max length of the message, so those details must be distractors. So the answer should be 4807.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The Ching has 9999 symbols, each with 10 possible combinations (2 yin/yang \u00d7 5 elements). This allows 10^9999 unique combinations. The Shu uses 120 characters, so the maximum message length \\( L \\) satisfies \\( 120^L \\leq 10^{9999} \\).

  "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is about finding the maximum length of a secret message encrypted in the Ching book using characters from the Shu. So, I need to figure out how much data can be encoded with the symbols in Ching, and how that translates into characters from Shu.\n\nFirst, the Ching has exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing. Each symbol is a combination like yin-water or yang-fire. Let's break that down. The yin and yang are two possibilities, and the wuxing elements are five: water, fire, wood, metal, earth. So each symbol is a combination of one of two (yin/yang) and one of five elements. That gives 2 * 5 = 10 possible unique symbols. Wait, but if each symbol in Ching is one of these 10 types, then each symbol can be represented with a number from 0 to 9, right? Because 10 possibilities can be stored in log2(10) \u2248 3.32 bits. But since each symbol is one of 10, maybe each symbol can encode log2(10) bits of information. But maybe the encryption uses each symbol to represent a digit in base 10. Like, each symbol is a digit 0-9. Then 9999 symbols would form a 4-digit number (since 9999 is four digits) but wait, 9999 symbols would allow for a number up to 10^9999 -1, which is a really big number. But how does this relate to the Shu's characters?\n\nThe Shu has 3000 characters but uses only 120 most common ones. So the message is written using those 120 characters. So each character in the message can be represented as one of 120 possibilities. To represent each character, how many bits do we need? Let's calculate log2(120). That's about 6.906, so 7 bits per character. Alternatively, since 2^7=128 which can cover 120. So each character would require 7 bits.\n\nNow, the Ching's symbols are 9999 in total. If each symbol can encode, say, one of 10 possibilities, then the total number of bits would be 9999 * log2(10) \u2248 9999 * 3.3219 \u2248 33,219 bits. Then, the number of characters possible from Shu's 120 would be the total bits divided by bits per character. So 33,219 /7 \u2248 4745.57. So about 4745 characters maximum. But wait, maybe there's another way. If each Ching symbol can encode a digit in base 10, then 9999 digits would form a number with 9999 digits in base 10. Then that number can be converted into base 120 to see how many digits it has, which would correspond to the number of characters. Because converting from base 10 to base 120 would give the number of characters needed.\n\nSo the maximum message length would be the number of base-120 digits that the Ching's 9999-digit base-10 number can represent. Let me think. The maximum value representable by 9999 digits in base 10 is 10^9999 -1. Then converting that to base 120, the number of digits would be floor(log_120 (10^9999 -1)) +1. Since log_120(10^9999) is log10(10^9999)/log10(120) = 9999/(log10(120)). Let's compute log10(120). Log10(100)=2, log10(120)=~2.07918. So 9999 / 2.07918 \u2248 9999 /2.079 \u2248 approx 4807. So that's about 4807 digits in base 120, which would correspond to the message length. So the maximum length is 4807. But wait, the options aren't given, but the answer should be 4807. But let me check.\n\nAlternatively, since each symbol in Ching can represent 10 possibilities, the total number of possible combinations is 10^9999. To represent this in terms of Shu's 120 characters, each character is a choice of 120, so the number of characters needed is the largest integer n where 120^n <= 10^9999. Taking logarithms: n <= log_120(10^9999) = 9999 * log_120(10). As log_120(10) is (ln10)/(ln120) \u2248 2.302585/(4.787492) \u2248 0.4807. So 9999 * 0.4807 \u2248 9999*0.48 \u2248 4807. So n\u22484807. So the maximum length is 4807. So the answer is 4807. \n\nBut wait, let's make sure. Because in information theory, the entropy would be log2(10^9999) = 9999 * log2(10) \u2248 9999 *3.3219\u224833,219 bits. The number of characters possible with 120 options is 33,219 / log2(120) \u224833,219 /6.906\u22484813. That's a different number. Hmm. So which approach is correct?\n\nAh, here's the confusion. If we model each Ching symbol as providing log2(10) bits, then total bits is around 33,219. Then, each Shu character requires log2(120) bits. So the total number of characters is 33,219 / log2(120) \u2248 33,219 /6.906\u22484813. But wait, this would give a different answer. So which is the right way?\n\nAlternatively, if we treat the entire sequence of Ching symbols as a single number in base 10, and then convert that number to base 120, the number of digits in base 120 would be floor(log_120(N)) +1, where N is 10^9999-1. But N is approximately 10^9999. So log_120(10^9999) is 9999 * log_120(10) \u2248 9999 * (1 / log_10(120)) ) = 9999 / 2.079 \u22484807. Thus, the number of digits in base 120 would be 4807. So answer is 4807.\n\nBut when using the information-theoretic approach, it's about 4813. So why the discrepancy?\n\nThe difference arises because the two methods treat the encoding differently. One is using the numeral system conversion (base 10 to base 120), which gives 4807. The other is using the entropy in bits, which gives a higher number. But the problem states that the Ching's symbols are used to encrypt the message. The way encryption is done here would determine which approach is correct. For example, if each symbol is considered a digit in a base-10 number, then converting that number into base-120 would give the number of characters. Alternatively, if each symbol is treated as a separate unit that can encode information, then maybe using entropy.\n\nBut the problem says the message is encrypted using the Ching's symbols. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the entire sequence of symbols as a number in base 10 (since each symbol has 10 possibilities), then express that number in base 120, which would give the number of characters. For example, if you have a number in base 10, say 9999 digits, the maximum value is 10^9999 -1. Converting that to base 120 would require log_120(10^9999) digits. Which is 9999 * log_10(10)/log_10(120) = 9999 / log10(120) \u2248 9999 /2.07918\u22484807.5. So floor(4807.5) is 4807, but when you add 1 (since the formula is floor(log(N)) +1), but wait, if N is 10^9999, then log_120(N) is exactly 9999 / log10(120). So the exact value is 9999 / log10(120) \u22484807.5. So floor(4807.5) =4807, then +1 gives 4808? Wait, no. Wait, no. Let's think again. The formula for the number of digits in base b for a number N is floor(log_b(N)) +1. If N is 10^9999, then log_b(N) = log_120(10^9999) = 9999 * log_120(10) =9999 / log_10(120) \u22484807.5. So floor(4807.5) is 4807, then +1 gives 4808. But wait, but 10^9999 in base 120 would have 4808 digits? Wait, but 120^4807 is less than 10^9999, and 120^4808 is greater than 10^9999. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nSuppose 120^4807.5 = 10^9999. Because log_120(10^9999) =4807.5. So 10^9999 =120^4807.5. So the number is equal to 120^4807.5. Thus, when converting 10^9999 to base 120, the number of digits would be the exponent's ceiling? Wait, no. Let me think with a smaller example. For example, if we have 10^3 =1000 in base 10. Convert to base 2: 1111101000, which is 10 bits. But log2(1000)= ~9.965, so floor(9.965)=9, +1=10. Which matches. So for 10^9999, log_120(10^9999)=4807.5. So floor(4807.5)=4807, then +1=4808. Therefore, the number of digits in base 120 is 4808. But wait, but 120^4808 is way larger than 10^9999. Wait, 120^4808 = (10^log10(120))^4808 =10^{4808 * log10(120)}. Since log10(120)\u22482.07918, 4808*2.07918\u22484808*2=9616, plus 4808*0.07918\u2248380. So total ~9616+380\u22489996. So 120^4808\u224810^9996, which is much less than 10^9999. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Wait, log10(120)\u22482.07918, so 4808 *2.07918\u22484808*2 +4808*0.07918\u22489616 + ~380.8\u224810,000. So 120^4808\u224810^10,000. But 10^9999 is 10^10,000 /10. So 120^4808 is larger than 10^9999. So 10^9999 < 120^4808. Therefore, 10^9999 in base 120 would have 4808 digits. But the maximum possible number in 4808 digits in base 120 is 120^4808 -1. Since 10^9999 is less than that, but how many digits does it have? For the number 10^9999 -1, which is the maximum number with 9999 digits in base 10. So converting that to base 120, the number of digits would be floor(log_120(10^9999 -1)) +1. Since 10^9999 -1 is less than 10^9999, which is less than 120^4808, so log_120(10^9999 -1) is slightly less than 4808, so floor would give 4807, +1 =4808. But maybe in reality, the exact calculation would require more precise math.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is the entropy one. Let's see. Each Ching symbol can represent 10 possibilities, so 9999 symbols can encode 10^9999 possibilities. The Shu has 120 characters, so the number of possible messages of length L is 120^L. We need to find the maximum L where 120^L <=10^9999. Solving for L: L <= log_120(10^9999) =9999 * log_120(10). Which is the same as before. So L= floor(9999 * log_10(10)/log_10(120)) ). Which is floor(9999 / 2.07918)\u2248 floor(4807.5)=4807. So maximum L is 4807. But wait, but 120^4807 = (10^{log10(120)})^4807 =10^{4807 * 2.07918}\u224810^{4807*2 +4807*0.07918}\u224810^(9614 + 380)\u224810^9994. So 10^9994 is less than 10^9999. So 120^4807 is 10^9994, which is much smaller than 10^9999. Then 120^4807 <10^9999, so 4807 is possible. What about 4807 +1=4808? Let's check 120^4808=120*120^4807\u2248120*10^9994\u22481.2*10^9996, which is still less than 10^9999 (which is 1e9999). Wait, but 1.2e9996 is way smaller than 1e9999. So even 4808 is way too small. Hmm, this seems contradictory. Wait, no, wait. The calculation earlier was that log_120(10^9999)=4807.5. So 120^4807.5=10^9999. So 120^4807=10^9999 / sqrt(120). Which is approximately 10^9999 / 10.95 \u2248 10^9998. So 120^4807 is about 1e9998, and 120^4808 is 1.2e9998 *120 =1.44e10000, which is larger than 1e9999. Wait, this math isn't adding up. The confusion here is that exponentiation isn't linear. Let's get back to the logarithm approach. Let me compute log_120(10^9999) = ln(10^9999)/ln(120) =9999*ln10 / ln(120). Compute that:\n\nln(10)=2.302585093\nln(120)=4.787491743\n\nSo 9999 * 2.302585093 /4.787491743 \u2248 9999*(0.4807)\u22489999*0.4807\u22484807.5\n\nSo the exponent is 4807.5, meaning that 120^4807.5=10^9999. So the maximum integer L where 120^L <=10^9999 is L= floor(4807.5)=4807. Because 120^4807 <10^9999 and 120^4808 >10^9999. Wait, no. If 120^4807.5=10^9999, then 120^4807=10^9999 / sqrt(120)\u224810^9999 / 10.954\u22489.13e9998. Which is much less than 10^9999. So 120^4807.5=1e9999, so 120^4807 =1e9999 / 120^0.5\u22481e9999 / 10.954\u22489.13e9998. So 120^4807 is 9.13e9998, which is less than 1e9999. Therefore, 120^4807 is less than 10^9999. Then 120^4808=120^4807 *120=9.13e9998*120\u22481.0956e10001. Which is greater than 1e9999. Therefore, the maximum L is 4807. Because 120^4807 is less than 10^9999, and 120^(4807+1)=120^4808 is greater than 10^9999. Therefore, the maximum L is 4807. So the answer is 4807.\n\nBut earlier when using the base conversion approach, we thought it might be 4808 digits. Wait, the formula says floor(log_b(N)) +1. So for N=10^9999, which is exactly 120^4807.5. So floor(log_120(N))=4807. Then +1 would be 4808. Therefore, when converting the number 10^9999 to base 120, it would have 4808 digits. But 120^4808 is larger than 10^9999, so how can that be? For example, the number 10 in base 10 is '10', which is 2 digits. To convert to base 2: 1010, which is 4 digits. log2(10)=3.32, floor(3.32)=3, +1=4. Which matches. So for N=10^9999, converting to base 120, the number of digits is 4808. But this would require that the number 10^9999 can be represented in 4808 digits in base 120. But since 120^4808 is much larger than 10^9999, the first digit would be something less than 120. For example, the maximum number with 4808 digits in base 120 is 120^4808 -1. So 10^9999 is less than that. Therefore, the number of digits needed is 4808. But that would mean that the maximum message length is 4808 characters. However, according to the previous calculation, the maximum L where 120^L <=10^9999 is 4807. Because 120^4807.5=10^9999, so 120^4807=10^9999 / 120^0.5\u22489.13e9998 <1e9999, so 120^4807 <1e9999, hence L=4807 would satisfy 120^4807 <=1e9999. But wait, 1e9999 is 10^9999, which is the number of possible combinations of Ching's symbols. So the message length L must satisfy 120^L <=10^9999. Solving for L gives L= floor( log_120(10^9999) )= floor(4807.5)=4807. Hence, the max message length is 4807.\n\nWait, but in base conversion, the number of digits would be 4808, which allows for numbers up to 120^4808 -1, which is way larger than 10^9999. So that's a different approach. Which is correct?\n\nThe crux is whether the encryption uses each Ching symbol as a base-10 digit, so that the entire sequence is a base-10 number, which is then converted to base-120 (Shu's characters). In that case, the number of digits in base-120 would be 4808, but since the actual value is 10^9999, which is less than 120^4808, the leading digits would be zero, but you can't have leading zeros in a number. Wait, no. For example, consider converting the number 1000 (base 10) to base 120. Let's see:\n\n1000 divided by 120: 1000 /120 =8.333... So the first digit (from right) is 1000 %120=40, then 8.333, which is 8*120=960, so next digit is 8. So the number would be [8,40] in base 120. But wait, 8*120 +40= 960+40=1000. So in base 120, it's written as two digits: 8 and 40. So the number of digits is 2. Here, log_120(1000)=log(1000)/log(120)=3/2.079\u22481.44, floor(1.44)=1, +1=2. Which matches. \n\nSo converting 10^9999 to base 120 would require 4808 digits, and since 10^9999 is less than 120^4808, the first digit would be non-zero. So the number of characters (digits) needed is 4808. Therefore, the maximum message length would be 4808. \n\nBut this contradicts the previous approach where using 120^L <=10^9999 gives L=4807. So which is correct?\n\nLet me take a smaller example. Let's say we have 10^3=1000 in base 10, and we convert it to base 120. As in the example above, it would take 2 digits (8 and 40). Which is floor(log_120(1000)) +1 = floor(1.44) +1=1+1=2. But 120^2=14400 >1000. So the maximum L where 120^L <=1000 is L=1, since 120^1=120<=1000, and 120^2=14400>1000. So according to that, the maximum message length would be 1. But when converting 1000 to base 120, you get two digits. So this seems contradictory.\n\nAh, here's the key. If the message can be represented as a number in base 120, then the number of digits is floor(log_120(N)) +1. However, the maximum L such that 120^L <=N is floor(log_120(N)). But since the message can use all possible combinations, including leading zeros, but in reality, leading zeros would not be allowed as they don't contribute to the value. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct messages (without leading zeros) is 120^L - (120^(L) - N) if N<120^L. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the maximum possible message length. Each character in the message is one of 120, so each position in the message can have 120 possibilities. The total number of possible messages of length L is 120^L. The total number of possible combinations from Ching is 10^9999. So the maximum L where 120^L <=10^9999. Solving for L:\n\nL = floor( log_120(10^9999) ) = floor( 9999 * log_10(10)/ log_10(120) ) = floor(9999 /2.07918)\u2248 floor(4807.5)=4807.\n\nTherefore, the maximum L is 4807. Because 120^4807 <=10^9999 <120^4808. So the message can be up to 4807 characters long. The base conversion approach gives 4808 digits, but that's because the first digit can be zero. But if the message cannot have leading zeros (assuming that the first character must be non-zero), then the actual number of possible messages of length 4808 would be 119*120^(4807). Which is 119*120^4807 <120^4808=120*120^4807=119*120^4807 +120^4807 >10^9999. So even if leading zeros are allowed, 120^4808 >10^9999, so you can't have messages of length 4808. Therefore, the maximum possible L is 4807.\n\nSo the correct answer is 4807. Therefore, the explanation is that each Ching symbol provides 10 possibilities, so total possibilities are 10^9999. Each Shu character provides 120 possibilities. The maximum message length is the largest L where 120^L <=10^9999. Solving gives L=4807.\n\nNow, the other parts of the question, like the computer vision tool's time and computation times, seem to be irrelevant here. The question is about the max length of the message, so those details must be distractors. So the answer should be 4807.",
