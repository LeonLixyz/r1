  "question": "In empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body with mass $M$, how many non-zero Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ are non-zero?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols in the vacuum outside a spherically symmetric mass M. So, the scenario here is the Schwarzschild metric, right? Because that's the solution to Einstein's equations for a spherically symmetric mass in vacuum.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the Schwarzschild metric. The line element in Schwarzschild coordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is usually written as ds\u00b2 = -(1 - 2M/r)dt\u00b2 + (1 - 2M/r)^-1 dr\u00b2 + r\u00b2(d\u03b8\u00b2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 d\u03c6\u00b2). Wait, M here is the mass parameter, so that's correct.\n\nChristoffel symbols are related to the metric components and their derivatives. The general formula for the Christoffel symbol is \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} = \u00bd g^{\u03c1\u03c3} (\u2202_\u03bc g_{\u03bd\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03bd g_{\u03c3\u03bc} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03bc\u03bd} ). Since we're in four dimensions, the indices \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03c1 go from 0 to 3 (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6). But not all components of the Christoffel symbols are non-zero. \n\nIn the Schwarzschild metric, the metric is diagonal. The components g_{tt} and g_{rr} depend only on r, while the angular parts (\u03b8 and \u03c6) have terms dependent on r and \u03b8. But since we're in the vacuum outside, we can assume the metric is static and spherically symmetric, so the dependence is only on r for the non-angular terms.\n\nSo, when calculating the Christoffel symbols, we'll have to compute the derivatives of the metric components. Because the metric is diagonal, many terms will vanish. Let's think about which derivatives are non-zero. For example, the derivative of g_{tt} with respect to r is non-zero. Similarly, the derivative of g_{rr} with respect to r is also non-zero. The angular parts like g_{\u03b8\u03b8} = r\u00b2, so derivative with respect to r is 2r, and derivative with respect to \u03b8 would be zero. Similarly, g_{\u03c6\u03c6} = r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, so derivative with respect to r is 2r sin\u00b2\u03b8 and derivative with respect to \u03b8 is 2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, when we compute the Christoffel symbols, only the derivatives that are non-zero will contribute. Let's consider each possible \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd}. \n\nFor example, \u0393^r_{tt} would involve derivatives of g_{tt} with respect to r. \u0393^r_{rr} would involve derivatives of g_{rr} with respect to r. Then there are the angular terms. For example, \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} would involve derivatives of g_{\u03b8\u03b8} with respect to r. \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} would involve derivatives of g_{\u03c6\u03c6} with respect to \u03b8. \n\nWait, but how many of these are non-zero? Let me try to list them. \n\nFirst, let's recall that because of the spherical symmetry and static nature, some symmetries will lead to some Christoffel symbols being non-zero and others zero. For example, all \u0393's with any index being t (except maybe for components where other indices are t or r) might be non-zero. But maybe not. Let's actually try to count them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a known number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric. From what I remember, the Schwarzschild metric has a certain number of non-zero Christoffels. Let me think. \n\nIn general, for a diagonal metric, many Christoffel symbols are zero. The non-zero ones would be those where the indices \u03bc, \u03bd, and \u03c3 (from the inverse metric) are such that the derivatives in the formula are non-zero. \n\nFor example, \u0393^t_{tr} would involve the derivative of g_{tt} with respect to r, which is non-zero. So \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} would be non-zero. Wait, but Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower indices, so \u0393^t_{tr} = \u0393^t_{rt}. So each pair would count once. Wait, but actually, each unique lower pair. Let me clarify.\n\nEach Christoffel symbol \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} is symmetric in \u03bc and \u03bd. So, for example, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} and \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} are non-zero. \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} and \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} would be the same. Similarly for \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} and \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r}. Then there are terms like \u0393^r_{tt} which is non-zero. Also, \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} would involve derivative of g_{\u03c6\u03c6} with respect to \u03b8, which would be non-zero (since g_{\u03c6\u03c6} has sin\u00b2\u03b8). \n\nLet me list them systematically. Let's consider each possible upper index \u03c1, and then see which lower indices \u03bc, \u03bd could give non-zero \u0393.\n\nUpper index t (0):\n\nThe possible \u0393^t_{\u03bc\u03bd} would involve terms where either \u03bc or \u03bd is t, and the other index is r because the metric components g_{tt} and g_{rr} depend on r. For example, \u0393^t_{tr} would be non-zero because it involves the derivative of g_{tt} with respect to r. Similarly, \u0393^t_{rt} is the same as \u0393^t_{tr}. So there are two components here (since \u03bc and \u03bd can be t and r, but due to symmetry, only one unique combination). But wait, when \u03c1 is t, the possible non-zero \u0393s would be \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt}, but since they are symmetric, it's just one unique component. Wait, but \u0393^t_{tr} is \u0393^t_{rt} due to symmetry. So in total, for upper index t, there is one independent non-zero component: \u0393^t_{rt} = \u0393^t_{tr}.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it. The formula for \u0393^t_{rt} would be (1/2)g^{tt}(\u2202_r g_{tt} + \u2202_t g_{tr} - \u2202_t g_{rt}). But since the metric is static, time derivatives are zero. Also, g_{tr} is zero since the metric is diagonal. Therefore, the terms would be (1/2)g^{tt}(\u2202_r g_{tt} + 0 - 0). So \u0393^t_{rt} = (1/2)g^{tt} \u2202_r g_{tt}. Since g_{tt} is a function of r, this is non-zero. So \u0393^t_{rt} is non-zero, and since it's symmetric in lower indices, this is the only component for upper index t. So upper index t contributes 1 non-zero \u0393.\n\nWait, but wait. \u0393^t_{rr}? Let's check. \u0393^t_{rr} would be (1/2)g^{tt}(\u2202_r g_{rt} + \u2202_r g_{rt} - \u2202_t g_{rr}). But g_{rt} is zero, and \u2202_t g_{rr}=0, so this becomes zero. So \u0393^t_{rr} is zero. Similarly, other combinations would give zero. So upper index t has only \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} (which are the same), so 1 unique non-zero component.\n\nUpper index r (1):\n\nNow, \u0393^r_{\u03bc\u03bd}. Let's see. The metric components g_{tt} and g_{rr} depend on r. The angular components g_{\u03b8\u03b8} and g_{\u03c6\u03c6} depend on r and \u03b8. For \u0393^r_{\u03bc\u03bd}, possible non-zero terms when \u03bc and \u03bd involve r or t or angular coordinates.\n\nFirst, \u0393^r_{tt}: This would involve derivatives of g_{tt} with respect to r. Let's calculate. The formula is \u0393^r_{tt} = (1/2) g^{rr} [ -\u2202_r g_{tt} + \u2202_t g_{t r} + \u2202_t g_{t r} - \u2202_t g_{tt} ]. Wait, no. Wait, using the general formula:\n\n\u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} = (1/2) g^{\u03c1\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03bc g_{\u03bd\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03bd g_{\u03bc\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03bc\u03bd} ]\n\nSo for \u0393^r_{tt} (\u03c1=r, \u03bc=\u03bd=t):\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{t\u03c3} + \u2202_t g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tt} ]\n\nBut since g_{r\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=r, and g^{r\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=r. So \u03c3 must be r here. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{tr} + \u2202_t g_{tr} - \u2202_r g_{tt} ]\n\nBut g_{tr}=0, so \u2202_t g_{tr}=0. So this becomes:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ - \u2202_r g_{tt} ]\n\nWhich is non-zero because \u2202_r g_{tt} = (d/dr)( - (1 - 2M/r) ) = - (2M/r\u00b2). Therefore, \u0393^r_{tt} is non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, \u0393^r_{rr} would be:\n\n\u0393^r_{rr} = (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_r g_{rr} + \u2202_r g_{rr} - \u2202_r g_{rr} ] = (1/2) g^{rr} (\u2202_r g_{rr} )\n\nBut g_{rr} = (1 - 2M/r)^{-1}, so its derivative is non-zero, so \u0393^r_{rr} is non-zero.\n\nThen \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}: Let's compute that. For \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03b8\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03b8\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03b8\u03b8} ]\n\nSince \u03c3 can only be r (because g^{r\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=r, as the metric is diagonal). So \u03c3=r:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03b8r} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03b8r} - \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8} ]\n\ng_{\u03b8r}=0, so first two terms are zero. Third term: \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8} = \u2202_r (r\u00b2) = 2r. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( - 2r )\n\nSince g^{rr} = (1 - 2M/r), so this becomes:\n\n(1/2) (1 - 2M/r) (-2r) ) = - (1 - 2M/r) r\n\nWhich is non-zero. Therefore, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} is non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\n\u03c3=r again:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6r} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6r} - \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\ng_{\u03c6r}=0, so first two terms are zero. Third term: \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6} = \u2202_r ( r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = 2r sin\u00b2\u03b8. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( - 2r sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n= - g^{rr} r sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nWhich is non-zero. So \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} is non-zero.\n\nAdditionally, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03c6} or \u0393^r_{t\u03b8} etc. would depend on other derivatives. Let's check \u0393^r_{t\u03b8}:\n\n\u0393^r_{t\u03b8} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{\u03b8\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{t\u03b8} ]\n\nAll terms here involve derivatives of g_{t\u03c3} or g_{\u03b8\u03c3} with respect to t or \u03b8. But the metric components g_{t\u03c3} are zero except g_{tt}, and \u2202_t of any metric component is zero (since static), and \u2202_\u03b8 of g_{t\u03c3} (which is zero) is zero. So this would be zero. So \u0393^r_{t\u03b8}=0.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations like \u0393^r_{r\u03b8} would involve terms where \u03bc=r, \u03bd=\u03b8. Let's compute \u0393^r_{r\u03b8}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{r\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{r\u03b8} ]\n\nAgain, \u03c3 must be r. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03b8r} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{rr} - \u2202_r g_{r\u03b8} ]\n\nBut g_{\u03b8r}=0, and g_{r\u03b8}=0. \u2202_\u03b8 g_{rr}=0 because g_{rr} is a function of r only. So all terms are zero. Hence, \u0393^r_{r\u03b8}=0.\n\nSo for upper index r, the non-zero components are \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}. Each of these corresponds to unique lower indices because they are symmetric only when \u03bc=\u03bd. For example, \u0393^r_{tt} is symmetric in \u03bc and \u03bd (both t here), \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} similarly. So these are four non-zero components for upper index r.\n\nWait, but \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}\u2014each of these is a single component because \u03bc and \u03bd are the same. Wait no, \u0393^r_{tt} is when \u03bc and \u03bd are both t. \u0393^r_{rr} is \u03bc and \u03bd both r. \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} and \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} are similar. So that's four components for upper index r.\n\nWait, but what about \u0393^r_{tr} or \u0393^r_{rt}? Let's check. For example, \u0393^r_{tr}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nSince g_{tr}=0 and the metric is static, all time derivatives are zero. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr}[0 + \u2202_r g_{tt} - \u2202_r g_{tr} ]\n\nBut g_{tr}=0, so the last term is zero. So this becomes:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} \u2202_r g_{tt} \n\nBut earlier, we had \u0393^r_{tt} = (1/2) g^{rr}( - \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nWait, no. Wait, \u0393^r_{tt} was computed as (1/2) g^{rr} (- \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nWait, let me recompute \u0393^r_{tt}. Using the formula:\n\n\u0393^r_{tt} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{t\u03c3} + \u2202_t g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tt} ]\n\nSince \u03c3 can only be r here (because gr\u03c3 is non-zero only when \u03c3=r), so:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{tr} + \u2202_t g_{tr} - \u2202_r g_{tt} ]\n\nBut g_{tr}=0, so first two terms are zero. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( - \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nWhich is non-zero. So \u0393^r_{tt} is non-zero. However, \u0393^r_{tr} would be:\n\n\u0393^r_{tr} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nAgain, \u03c3=r:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{rr} + \u2202_r g_{tt} - \u2202_r g_{tr} ]\n\nBut \u2202_t g_{rr}=0, and g_{tr}=0, so last term is zero. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nBut wait, this is (1/2 g^{rr} \u2202_r g_{tt}), but \u0393^r_{tt} is ( -1/2 g^{rr} \u2202_r g_{tt} ). Wait, no. Wait, what's the relation between \u0393^r_{tt} and \u0393^r_{tr}? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the indices. Let me clarify. The index for \u0393^r_{tr} would be upper index r, lower indices t and r. But Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower indices. So \u0393^r_{tr} = \u0393^r_{rt}. But when calculating \u0393^r_{tr}, we need to use the formula with \u03bc=t, \u03bd=r. \n\nWait, let's do that correctly. For \u0393^r_{tr} (\u03bc=t, \u03bd=r):\n\n\u0393^r_{tr} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, g_{r\u03c3} is zero unless \u03c3=r. So \u03c3=r:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{rr} + \u2202_r g_{tt} - \u2202_r g_{tr} ]\n\nBut \u2202_t g_{rr}=0 (static metric), and g_{tr}=0, so the last term is zero. Thus:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nBut g_{tt} = -(1 - 2M/r), so \u2202_r g_{tt} = 2M/r\u00b2. Therefore:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} (2M/r\u00b2 )\n\nSince g^{rr} = 1/(1 - 2M/r) = (r)/(r - 2M). So:\n\n= (1/2) * (r/(r - 2M)) * (2M/r\u00b2) ) = (M)/(r(r - 2M))\n\nWait, but this seems non-zero. So \u0393^r_{tr} is non-zero? That would add another component. But wait, earlier I thought upper index r had four non-zero components. But now, \u0393^r_{tr} (which is symmetric in t and r, so we can consider \u0393^r_{rt} as well) would actually be another component. Wait, but \u0393^r_{tr} is \u0393^r_{rt} because of symmetry. So it's one component. Wait, but earlier I thought \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} were the four, but maybe there's more.\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine. I think I may have missed some components.\n\nLet's consider all possible combinations for upper index r:\n\n1. \u03bc = t, \u03bd = t: \u0393^r_{tt} \u2192 non-zero.\n2. \u03bc = r, \u03bd = r: \u0393^r_{rr} \u2192 non-zero.\n3. \u03bc = \u03b8, \u03bd = \u03b8: \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} \u2192 non-zero.\n4. \u03bc = \u03c6, \u03bd = \u03c6: \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2192 non-zero.\n5. \u03bc = t, \u03bd = r: \u0393^r_{tr} \u2192 non-zero (as just calculated).\n   But since \u03bc and \u03bd are t and r, and the symbol is symmetric, this is one component.\n\nWait, so that's five components for upper index r? But I thought there were only four. Hmm. Let me check.\n\nWait, \u0393^r_{tr} is the same as \u0393^r_{rt}, so that's one component. So upper index r would have:\n\n1. \u0393^r_{tt}\n2. \u0393^r_{rr}\n3. \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}\n4. \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n5. \u0393^r_{tr} (which is \u0393^r_{rt})\n\nSo that's five non-zero components for upper index r. But wait, this contradicts my earlier count. Where am I making the mistake?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier when calculating \u0393^r_{tr}. Let's verify again. The formula for \u0393^r_{tr} (\u03bc=t, \u03bd=r):\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nBut in Schwarzschild coordinates, g_{t\u03c3} is zero except when \u03c3=t. So for \u03c3=r, g_{tr}=0. So for \u03c3=r, the terms are:\n\n\u2202_t g_{rr} (which is zero) + \u2202_r g_{tt} (since g_{t\u03c3} when \u03c3=r is zero, so the second term is \u2202_r g_{t r} = 0?), wait no.\n\nWait, the second term in the formula is \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3}. Here, \u03c3 is r, so g_{t\u03c3} = g_{tr} = 0. Therefore, \u2202_r g_{tr} = 0.\n\nThus, the first term is \u2202_t g_{rr} =0, the second term is \u2202_r g_{tr}=0, and the third term is \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} = \u2202_r g_{tr} =0. So the entire expression is zero. Wait, this contradicts my previous calculation. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no. Let me do this step by step. \u0393^r_{tr} is given by:\n\n\u0393^r_{tr} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nBut in this case, since \u03c3 must be summed over, but g^{r\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=r, so only \u03c3=r contributes. So:\n\n\u0393^r_{tr} = (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{rr} + \u2202_r g_{t r} - \u2202_r g_{tr} ]\n\nBut g_{rr} is a function of r only, so \u2202_t g_{rr}=0. The term \u2202_r g_{t r} is \u2202_r of g_{tr}=0, which is zero. The last term \u2202_r g_{tr}=0. So all terms are zero. Therefore, \u0393^r_{tr} =0.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there was a non-zero term. Where was the mistake? Earlier, I thought \u2202_r g_{tt} would contribute, but in the formula for \u0393^r_{tr}, the term \u2202_r g_{tt} doesn't appear. So \u0393^r_{tr} is actually zero. Earlier calculation must have been incorrect. Therefore, \u0393^r_{tr}=0.\n\nTherefore, the original count for upper index r is four components: \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}.\n\nWait, so that's four non-zero Christoffel symbols for upper index r.\n\nNow upper index \u03b8 (2):\n\nLet's consider \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03bc\u03bd}. These would involve derivatives of the metric components with respect to \u03b8 and r. For example, \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} would be non-zero because g_{\u03b8\u03b8} depends on r. Similarly, \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} is the same due to symmetry.\n\nLet's compute \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03c3} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{r\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{r\u03b8} ]\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, g^{\u03b8\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=\u03b8. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03b8} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{r\u03b8} - \u2202_\u03b8 g_{r\u03b8} ]\n\nBut g_{r\u03b8}=0, so the last two terms cancel. Thus:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03b8} \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8} \n\ng_{\u03b8\u03b8}=r\u00b2, so \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8}=2r. g^{\u03b8\u03b8}=1/r\u00b2. Therefore:\n\n= (1/2)(1/r\u00b2)(2r) = 1/r\n\nWhich is non-zero. So \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8}=\u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r}=1/r. So this is a non-zero component.\n\nAnother component \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\nSince g^{\u03b8\u03c3} is non-zero only for \u03c3=\u03b8, so:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03b8} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03b8} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03b8} - \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\ng_{\u03c6\u03b8}=0, so first two terms are zero. Third term: \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} = \u2202_\u03b8 (r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8. So:\n\n= (1/2)(1/r\u00b2)( - 2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 ) = - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8\n\nWhich is non-zero. So \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} is non-zero.\n\nOther components for upper index \u03b8:\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{tt} would involve derivatives of g_{tt} with respect to \u03b8, which is zero. Similarly \u0393^\u03b8_{tr}=0, \u0393^\u03b8_{rr}=0. \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8\u03b8} would require derivatives of g_{\u03b8\u03b8} with respect to \u03b8, but g_{\u03b8\u03b8}=r\u00b2, which is independent of \u03b8, so \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8\u03b8}=0.\n\nSo for upper index \u03b8, the non-zero components are:\n\n1. \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} = \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} \u2192 1 component (since symmetric)\n2. \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2192 1 component\n\nSo total of 2 non-zero components for upper index \u03b8.\n\nUpper index \u03c6 (3):\n\nNow \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03bc\u03bd}. Let's compute these.\n\nFirst, \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c3} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{r\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{r\u03c6} ]\n\ng^{\u03c6\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=\u03c6. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{r\u03c6} - \u2202_\u03c6 g_{r\u03c6} ]\n\nThe last two terms cancel. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6} \n\ng_{\u03c6\u03c6}=r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, so \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6}=2r sin\u00b2\u03b8. g^{\u03c6\u03c6}=1/(r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8). Therefore:\n\n= (1/2)(1/(r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8))(2r sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) = 1/r\n\nSo \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6}=\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r}=1/r, non-zero.\n\nNext, \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03b8\u03c6} ]\n\nAgain, \u03c3=\u03c6:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8\u03c6} - \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8\u03c6} ]\n\nThe last two terms cancel. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} \n\ng_{\u03c6\u03c6}=r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, so \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6}= 2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nThus:\n\n= (1/2)(1/(r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8))(2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) ) = (1/(r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8))(r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) = cot\u03b8\n\nSo \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6}=\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8}=cot\u03b8, which is non-zero.\n\nOther components for upper index \u03c6:\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{tt}=0, \u0393^\u03c6_{rr}=0, \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03b8}=0. What about \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03c6}? Let's compute:\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03c6} = (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\n\u03c3=\u03c6:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6}[ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} - \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} ( \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} )\n\nBut g_{\u03c6\u03c6}=r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, and \u2202_\u03c6 of this is zero (since it's independent of \u03c6). So \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03c6}=0.\n\nSo for upper index \u03c6, the non-zero components are:\n\n1. \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} = \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r} \u2192 1 component\n2. \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} = \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8} \u2192 1 component\n\nSo total of 2 non-zero components for upper index \u03c6.\n\nNow, summing up all non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n\n- Upper index t: 1 component (\u0393^t_{tr})\n- Upper index r: 4 components (\u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6})\n- Upper index \u03b8: 2 components (\u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8}, \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6})\n- Upper index \u03c6: 2 components (\u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6}, \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6})\n\nTotal: 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recount. Each of these components, considering their symmetric counterparts. For example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are the same, so counted once. Similarly, \u0393^r_{tt} is symmetric in \u03bc and \u03bd (which are the same here), so only once. For the other upper indices:\n\nUpper index t: \u0393^t_{tr} (which is \u0393^t_{rt}) \u2192 1 component.\n\nUpper index r: \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2192 4 components, each with \u03bc=\u03bd, so no duplicates.\n\nUpper index \u03b8: \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} (symmetric in r and \u03b8, so counts as 1 component), \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} (\u03bc=\u03bd=\u03c6, but wait, the indices here are \u03b8 and \u03c6? Wait, no. For \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6}, \u03bc=\u03c6, \u03bd=\u03c6? Wait, no. Upper index is \u03b8, lower indices are \u03c6 and \u03c6. So \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} would have \u03bc=\u03c6, \u03bd=\u03c6. So that's one component. But wait, the lower indices are \u03c6 and \u03c6; since the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower indices, this is allowed.\n\nUpper index \u03c6: \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} (symmetric in r and \u03c6), \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} (symmetric in \u03b8 and \u03c6).\n\nSo total non-zero components:\n\nt: 1\n\nr: 4\n\n\u03b8: 2\n\n\u03c6: 2\n\nTotal: 9.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some components. Let me cross-verify with a known source or count.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to recall that in the Schwarzschild metric, there are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols. But I'm not sure; maybe I'm confusing with another metric.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a reference, but since I can't do that, I need to proceed with my calculation.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n\nFor upper index t:\n- \u0393^t_{tr} (and \u0393^t_{rt}), but counted as 1.\n\nUpper index r:\n- \u0393^r_{tt}\n- \u0393^r_{rr}\n- \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}\n- \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n\nUpper index \u03b8:\n- \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} (and \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r}), 1\n- \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n\nUpper index \u03c6:\n- \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} (and \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r}), 1\n- \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} (and \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8}), 1\n\nSo that's 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n\nWait, but another possibility is that \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03c6} could be non-zero? Let's check. For \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03b8\u03c6} ]\n\nBut \u03c3 must be r. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6r} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8r} - \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03c6} ]\n\nAll terms here are zero since g_{\u03c6r}=0, g_{\u03b8r}=0, and g_{\u03b8\u03c6}=0. So \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03c6}=0.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations would likely be zero.\n\nThus, total of 9 non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\nBut I thought there were more. Alternatively, maybe I missed some components. Let me check another approach.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric in the usual coordinates has the following non-zero Christoffel symbols (as per standard references):\n\n\u0393^t_{tr} = M/(r(r - 2M))\n\n\u0393^r_{tt} = M(r - 2M)/r\u00b3\n\n\u0393^r_{rr} = -M/(r(r - 2M))\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} = -(r - 2M)\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} = -(r - 2M) sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} = 1/r\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} = -sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} = 1/r\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} = cot\u03b8\n\nThese are 9 distinct non-zero Christoffel symbols. Hence, the answer should be 9.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols. Since Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower indices, some components are duplicates. For example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are the same. However, the question counts them as separate entries only if the indices are different. But no, the Christoffel symbols \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} are symmetric in \u03bc and \u03bd, so \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} and \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bd\u03bc} are the same. Therefore, each unique combination of \u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd where \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd determines a unique component. However, when counting the number of non-zero components, we need to consider all possible (\u03bc, \u03bd) pairs, but since they are symmetric, for \u03bc \u2260 \u03bd, the component is counted once. But in reality, for example, \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} and \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} are the same component. Therefore, when counting the total number of non-zero components, we count each unique (\u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd) where \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd, but the question is phrased as \"how many non-zero Christoffel symbols \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 are non-zero?\" The notation \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 implies that \u03bc and \u03bd are symmetric, so each distinct triplet (\u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd) where \u03bc and \u03bd can be in any order counts as a single component. Wait, no. In the Christoffel symbol, \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 and \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1 are the same, so when listing all possible combinations, for \u03bc \u2260 \u03bd, each unordered pair counts once. But the problem just asks \"how many are non-zero\", regardless of their symmetry. However, in reality, the answer depends on whether \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 and \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1 are considered the same component or separate. If the question considers \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 and \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1 as separate symbols, even though they are equal, then for each \u03bc \u2260 \u03bd pair, there are two entries but they are equal. However, the standard count treats them as the same component because of their symmetry. But the question doesn't specify, so we need to clarify.\n\nIn the context of general relativity, Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower two indices, so \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 = \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1. Therefore, when counting the number of independent non-zero components, we consider \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd. However, if the question is asking for the total number of components that are non-zero, regardless of their symmetry, then for each \u03bc \u2260 \u03bd, both \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 and \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1 are non-zero, but they are equal. But since they are the same value, but different indices, depending on the problem's intention.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how many non-zero Christoffel symbols \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 are non-zero?\" So, for example, if \u0393_{tr}^r is non-zero, then \u0393_{rt}^r is also non-zero because it's symmetric. But they are considered different components. Wait, no. The standard way is to consider \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 as components where \u03bc and \u03bd are indices without ordering. But technically, the indices are ordered, but due to symmetry, the component for \u03bc,\u03bd is the same as \u03bd,\u03bc. So when counting the total number of non-zero components, you can either count them as separate (which would double-count some) or as unique pairs. \n\nBut the question might be expecting the total number including symmetric counterparts. For example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are the same component, so counted once. Whereas \u0393^r_{tt} is counted once. However, in actual calculation, each combination of \u03bc and \u03bd (without considering symmetry) may be considered. But in reality, due to the symmetry, they are not independent. So to avoid double-counting, the correct count is the number of unique (\u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd) with \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd. But how does this translate to the total number of non-zero components when considering all possible \u03bc and \u03bd?\n\nTaking the list from before:\n\n\u0393^t_{tr} (includes \u0393^t_{rt})\n\n\u0393^r_{tt}\n\n\u0393^r_{rr}\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} (includes \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r})\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} (includes \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r})\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} (includes \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8})\n\nSo that's 9 unique components when considering \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd. However, if we count all possible \u03bc and \u03bd without considering symmetry, then for example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are both considered non-zero but are equal. So in that case, the total number would be higher.\n\nBut I think the question is asking for the number of non-zero components, taking into account the symmetry. So for each \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 where \u03bc and \u03bd can be in any order, but each unique combination is counted once. Therefore, the answer would be 9.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider a standard source. For example, the Schwarzschild metric has the following non-zero Christoffel symbols (in (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) coordinates):\n\n\u0393^t_{tr} = \u0393^t_{rt} = M/(r(r-2M))\n\n\u0393^r_{tt} = (M(r-2M))/r^3\n\n\u0393^r_{rr} = -M/(r(r-2M))\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} = -(r-2M)\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} = -(r-2M) sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} = \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} = 1/r\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} = -sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} = \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r} = 1/r\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} = \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8} = cot\u03b8\n\nSo these are 9 unique components when considering the symmetry (since, for example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are the same component). Therefore, the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is 9.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: In the Schwarzschild metric describing the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass \\( M \\), the non-zero Christoffel symbols are determined by the metric's dependence on \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\).

  "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is about the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols in the vacuum outside a spherically symmetric mass M. So, the scenario here is the Schwarzschild metric, right? Because that's the solution to Einstein's equations for a spherically symmetric mass in vacuum.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the Schwarzschild metric. The line element in Schwarzschild coordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is usually written as ds\u00b2 = -(1 - 2M/r)dt\u00b2 + (1 - 2M/r)^-1 dr\u00b2 + r\u00b2(d\u03b8\u00b2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 d\u03c6\u00b2). Wait, M here is the mass parameter, so that's correct.\n\nChristoffel symbols are related to the metric components and their derivatives. The general formula for the Christoffel symbol is \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} = \u00bd g^{\u03c1\u03c3} (\u2202_\u03bc g_{\u03bd\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03bd g_{\u03c3\u03bc} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03bc\u03bd} ). Since we're in four dimensions, the indices \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03c1 go from 0 to 3 (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6). But not all components of the Christoffel symbols are non-zero. \n\nIn the Schwarzschild metric, the metric is diagonal. The components g_{tt} and g_{rr} depend only on r, while the angular parts (\u03b8 and \u03c6) have terms dependent on r and \u03b8. But since we're in the vacuum outside, we can assume the metric is static and spherically symmetric, so the dependence is only on r for the non-angular terms.\n\nSo, when calculating the Christoffel symbols, we'll have to compute the derivatives of the metric components. Because the metric is diagonal, many terms will vanish. Let's think about which derivatives are non-zero. For example, the derivative of g_{tt} with respect to r is non-zero. Similarly, the derivative of g_{rr} with respect to r is also non-zero. The angular parts like g_{\u03b8\u03b8} = r\u00b2, so derivative with respect to r is 2r, and derivative with respect to \u03b8 would be zero. Similarly, g_{\u03c6\u03c6} = r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, so derivative with respect to r is 2r sin\u00b2\u03b8 and derivative with respect to \u03b8 is 2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, when we compute the Christoffel symbols, only the derivatives that are non-zero will contribute. Let's consider each possible \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd}. \n\nFor example, \u0393^r_{tt} would involve derivatives of g_{tt} with respect to r. \u0393^r_{rr} would involve derivatives of g_{rr} with respect to r. Then there are the angular terms. For example, \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} would involve derivatives of g_{\u03b8\u03b8} with respect to r. \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} would involve derivatives of g_{\u03c6\u03c6} with respect to \u03b8. \n\nWait, but how many of these are non-zero? Let me try to list them. \n\nFirst, let's recall that because of the spherical symmetry and static nature, some symmetries will lead to some Christoffel symbols being non-zero and others zero. For example, all \u0393's with any index being t (except maybe for components where other indices are t or r) might be non-zero. But maybe not. Let's actually try to count them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a known number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric. From what I remember, the Schwarzschild metric has a certain number of non-zero Christoffels. Let me think. \n\nIn general, for a diagonal metric, many Christoffel symbols are zero. The non-zero ones would be those where the indices \u03bc, \u03bd, and \u03c3 (from the inverse metric) are such that the derivatives in the formula are non-zero. \n\nFor example, \u0393^t_{tr} would involve the derivative of g_{tt} with respect to r, which is non-zero. So \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} would be non-zero. Wait, but Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower indices, so \u0393^t_{tr} = \u0393^t_{rt}. So each pair would count once. Wait, but actually, each unique lower pair. Let me clarify.\n\nEach Christoffel symbol \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} is symmetric in \u03bc and \u03bd. So, for example, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} and \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} are non-zero. \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} and \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} would be the same. Similarly for \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} and \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r}. Then there are terms like \u0393^r_{tt} which is non-zero. Also, \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} would involve derivative of g_{\u03c6\u03c6} with respect to \u03b8, which would be non-zero (since g_{\u03c6\u03c6} has sin\u00b2\u03b8). \n\nLet me list them systematically. Let's consider each possible upper index \u03c1, and then see which lower indices \u03bc, \u03bd could give non-zero \u0393.\n\nUpper index t (0):\n\nThe possible \u0393^t_{\u03bc\u03bd} would involve terms where either \u03bc or \u03bd is t, and the other index is r because the metric components g_{tt} and g_{rr} depend on r. For example, \u0393^t_{tr} would be non-zero because it involves the derivative of g_{tt} with respect to r. Similarly, \u0393^t_{rt} is the same as \u0393^t_{tr}. So there are two components here (since \u03bc and \u03bd can be t and r, but due to symmetry, only one unique combination). But wait, when \u03c1 is t, the possible non-zero \u0393s would be \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt}, but since they are symmetric, it's just one unique component. Wait, but \u0393^t_{tr} is \u0393^t_{rt} due to symmetry. So in total, for upper index t, there is one independent non-zero component: \u0393^t_{rt} = \u0393^t_{tr}.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it. The formula for \u0393^t_{rt} would be (1/2)g^{tt}(\u2202_r g_{tt} + \u2202_t g_{tr} - \u2202_t g_{rt}). But since the metric is static, time derivatives are zero. Also, g_{tr} is zero since the metric is diagonal. Therefore, the terms would be (1/2)g^{tt}(\u2202_r g_{tt} + 0 - 0). So \u0393^t_{rt} = (1/2)g^{tt} \u2202_r g_{tt}. Since g_{tt} is a function of r, this is non-zero. So \u0393^t_{rt} is non-zero, and since it's symmetric in lower indices, this is the only component for upper index t. So upper index t contributes 1 non-zero \u0393.\n\nWait, but wait. \u0393^t_{rr}? Let's check. \u0393^t_{rr} would be (1/2)g^{tt}(\u2202_r g_{rt} + \u2202_r g_{rt} - \u2202_t g_{rr}). But g_{rt} is zero, and \u2202_t g_{rr}=0, so this becomes zero. So \u0393^t_{rr} is zero. Similarly, other combinations would give zero. So upper index t has only \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} (which are the same), so 1 unique non-zero component.\n\nUpper index r (1):\n\nNow, \u0393^r_{\u03bc\u03bd}. Let's see. The metric components g_{tt} and g_{rr} depend on r. The angular components g_{\u03b8\u03b8} and g_{\u03c6\u03c6} depend on r and \u03b8. For \u0393^r_{\u03bc\u03bd}, possible non-zero terms when \u03bc and \u03bd involve r or t or angular coordinates.\n\nFirst, \u0393^r_{tt}: This would involve derivatives of g_{tt} with respect to r. Let's calculate. The formula is \u0393^r_{tt} = (1/2) g^{rr} [ -\u2202_r g_{tt} + \u2202_t g_{t r} + \u2202_t g_{t r} - \u2202_t g_{tt} ]. Wait, no. Wait, using the general formula:\n\n\u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} = (1/2) g^{\u03c1\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03bc g_{\u03bd\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03bd g_{\u03bc\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03bc\u03bd} ]\n\nSo for \u0393^r_{tt} (\u03c1=r, \u03bc=\u03bd=t):\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{t\u03c3} + \u2202_t g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tt} ]\n\nBut since g_{r\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=r, and g^{r\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=r. So \u03c3 must be r here. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{tr} + \u2202_t g_{tr} - \u2202_r g_{tt} ]\n\nBut g_{tr}=0, so \u2202_t g_{tr}=0. So this becomes:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ - \u2202_r g_{tt} ]\n\nWhich is non-zero because \u2202_r g_{tt} = (d/dr)( - (1 - 2M/r) ) = - (2M/r\u00b2). Therefore, \u0393^r_{tt} is non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, \u0393^r_{rr} would be:\n\n\u0393^r_{rr} = (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_r g_{rr} + \u2202_r g_{rr} - \u2202_r g_{rr} ] = (1/2) g^{rr} (\u2202_r g_{rr} )\n\nBut g_{rr} = (1 - 2M/r)^{-1}, so its derivative is non-zero, so \u0393^r_{rr} is non-zero.\n\nThen \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}: Let's compute that. For \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03b8\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03b8\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03b8\u03b8} ]\n\nSince \u03c3 can only be r (because g^{r\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=r, as the metric is diagonal). So \u03c3=r:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03b8r} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03b8r} - \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8} ]\n\ng_{\u03b8r}=0, so first two terms are zero. Third term: \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8} = \u2202_r (r\u00b2) = 2r. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( - 2r )\n\nSince g^{rr} = (1 - 2M/r), so this becomes:\n\n(1/2) (1 - 2M/r) (-2r) ) = - (1 - 2M/r) r\n\nWhich is non-zero. Therefore, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} is non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\n\u03c3=r again:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6r} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6r} - \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\ng_{\u03c6r}=0, so first two terms are zero. Third term: \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6} = \u2202_r ( r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = 2r sin\u00b2\u03b8. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( - 2r sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\n= - g^{rr} r sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nWhich is non-zero. So \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} is non-zero.\n\nAdditionally, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03c6} or \u0393^r_{t\u03b8} etc. would depend on other derivatives. Let's check \u0393^r_{t\u03b8}:\n\n\u0393^r_{t\u03b8} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{\u03b8\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{t\u03b8} ]\n\nAll terms here involve derivatives of g_{t\u03c3} or g_{\u03b8\u03c3} with respect to t or \u03b8. But the metric components g_{t\u03c3} are zero except g_{tt}, and \u2202_t of any metric component is zero (since static), and \u2202_\u03b8 of g_{t\u03c3} (which is zero) is zero. So this would be zero. So \u0393^r_{t\u03b8}=0.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations like \u0393^r_{r\u03b8} would involve terms where \u03bc=r, \u03bd=\u03b8. Let's compute \u0393^r_{r\u03b8}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{r\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{r\u03b8} ]\n\nAgain, \u03c3 must be r. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03b8r} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{rr} - \u2202_r g_{r\u03b8} ]\n\nBut g_{\u03b8r}=0, and g_{r\u03b8}=0. \u2202_\u03b8 g_{rr}=0 because g_{rr} is a function of r only. So all terms are zero. Hence, \u0393^r_{r\u03b8}=0.\n\nSo for upper index r, the non-zero components are \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}. Each of these corresponds to unique lower indices because they are symmetric only when \u03bc=\u03bd. For example, \u0393^r_{tt} is symmetric in \u03bc and \u03bd (both t here), \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} similarly. So these are four non-zero components for upper index r.\n\nWait, but \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}\u2014each of these is a single component because \u03bc and \u03bd are the same. Wait no, \u0393^r_{tt} is when \u03bc and \u03bd are both t. \u0393^r_{rr} is \u03bc and \u03bd both r. \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} and \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} are similar. So that's four components for upper index r.\n\nWait, but what about \u0393^r_{tr} or \u0393^r_{rt}? Let's check. For example, \u0393^r_{tr}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nSince g_{tr}=0 and the metric is static, all time derivatives are zero. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr}[0 + \u2202_r g_{tt} - \u2202_r g_{tr} ]\n\nBut g_{tr}=0, so the last term is zero. So this becomes:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} \u2202_r g_{tt} \n\nBut earlier, we had \u0393^r_{tt} = (1/2) g^{rr}( - \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nWait, no. Wait, \u0393^r_{tt} was computed as (1/2) g^{rr} (- \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nWait, let me recompute \u0393^r_{tt}. Using the formula:\n\n\u0393^r_{tt} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{t\u03c3} + \u2202_t g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tt} ]\n\nSince \u03c3 can only be r here (because gr\u03c3 is non-zero only when \u03c3=r), so:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{tr} + \u2202_t g_{tr} - \u2202_r g_{tt} ]\n\nBut g_{tr}=0, so first two terms are zero. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( - \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nWhich is non-zero. So \u0393^r_{tt} is non-zero. However, \u0393^r_{tr} would be:\n\n\u0393^r_{tr} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nAgain, \u03c3=r:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{rr} + \u2202_r g_{tt} - \u2202_r g_{tr} ]\n\nBut \u2202_t g_{rr}=0, and g_{tr}=0, so last term is zero. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nBut wait, this is (1/2 g^{rr} \u2202_r g_{tt}), but \u0393^r_{tt} is ( -1/2 g^{rr} \u2202_r g_{tt} ). Wait, no. Wait, what's the relation between \u0393^r_{tt} and \u0393^r_{tr}? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the indices. Let me clarify. The index for \u0393^r_{tr} would be upper index r, lower indices t and r. But Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower indices. So \u0393^r_{tr} = \u0393^r_{rt}. But when calculating \u0393^r_{tr}, we need to use the formula with \u03bc=t, \u03bd=r. \n\nWait, let's do that correctly. For \u0393^r_{tr} (\u03bc=t, \u03bd=r):\n\n\u0393^r_{tr} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, g_{r\u03c3} is zero unless \u03c3=r. So \u03c3=r:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{rr} + \u2202_r g_{tt} - \u2202_r g_{tr} ]\n\nBut \u2202_t g_{rr}=0 (static metric), and g_{tr}=0, so the last term is zero. Thus:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} ( \u2202_r g_{tt} )\n\nBut g_{tt} = -(1 - 2M/r), so \u2202_r g_{tt} = 2M/r\u00b2. Therefore:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} (2M/r\u00b2 )\n\nSince g^{rr} = 1/(1 - 2M/r) = (r)/(r - 2M). So:\n\n= (1/2) * (r/(r - 2M)) * (2M/r\u00b2) ) = (M)/(r(r - 2M))\n\nWait, but this seems non-zero. So \u0393^r_{tr} is non-zero? That would add another component. But wait, earlier I thought upper index r had four non-zero components. But now, \u0393^r_{tr} (which is symmetric in t and r, so we can consider \u0393^r_{rt} as well) would actually be another component. Wait, but \u0393^r_{tr} is \u0393^r_{rt} because of symmetry. So it's one component. Wait, but earlier I thought \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} were the four, but maybe there's more.\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine. I think I may have missed some components.\n\nLet's consider all possible combinations for upper index r:\n\n1. \u03bc = t, \u03bd = t: \u0393^r_{tt} \u2192 non-zero.\n2. \u03bc = r, \u03bd = r: \u0393^r_{rr} \u2192 non-zero.\n3. \u03bc = \u03b8, \u03bd = \u03b8: \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} \u2192 non-zero.\n4. \u03bc = \u03c6, \u03bd = \u03c6: \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2192 non-zero.\n5. \u03bc = t, \u03bd = r: \u0393^r_{tr} \u2192 non-zero (as just calculated).\n   But since \u03bc and \u03bd are t and r, and the symbol is symmetric, this is one component.\n\nWait, so that's five components for upper index r? But I thought there were only four. Hmm. Let me check.\n\nWait, \u0393^r_{tr} is the same as \u0393^r_{rt}, so that's one component. So upper index r would have:\n\n1. \u0393^r_{tt}\n2. \u0393^r_{rr}\n3. \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}\n4. \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n5. \u0393^r_{tr} (which is \u0393^r_{rt})\n\nSo that's five non-zero components for upper index r. But wait, this contradicts my earlier count. Where am I making the mistake?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier when calculating \u0393^r_{tr}. Let's verify again. The formula for \u0393^r_{tr} (\u03bc=t, \u03bd=r):\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nBut in Schwarzschild coordinates, g_{t\u03c3} is zero except when \u03c3=t. So for \u03c3=r, g_{tr}=0. So for \u03c3=r, the terms are:\n\n\u2202_t g_{rr} (which is zero) + \u2202_r g_{tt} (since g_{t\u03c3} when \u03c3=r is zero, so the second term is \u2202_r g_{t r} = 0?), wait no.\n\nWait, the second term in the formula is \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3}. Here, \u03c3 is r, so g_{t\u03c3} = g_{tr} = 0. Therefore, \u2202_r g_{tr} = 0.\n\nThus, the first term is \u2202_t g_{rr} =0, the second term is \u2202_r g_{tr}=0, and the third term is \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} = \u2202_r g_{tr} =0. So the entire expression is zero. Wait, this contradicts my previous calculation. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no. Let me do this step by step. \u0393^r_{tr} is given by:\n\n\u0393^r_{tr} = (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_t g_{r\u03c3} + \u2202_r g_{t\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{tr} ]\n\nBut in this case, since \u03c3 must be summed over, but g^{r\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=r, so only \u03c3=r contributes. So:\n\n\u0393^r_{tr} = (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_t g_{rr} + \u2202_r g_{t r} - \u2202_r g_{tr} ]\n\nBut g_{rr} is a function of r only, so \u2202_t g_{rr}=0. The term \u2202_r g_{t r} is \u2202_r of g_{tr}=0, which is zero. The last term \u2202_r g_{tr}=0. So all terms are zero. Therefore, \u0393^r_{tr} =0.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there was a non-zero term. Where was the mistake? Earlier, I thought \u2202_r g_{tt} would contribute, but in the formula for \u0393^r_{tr}, the term \u2202_r g_{tt} doesn't appear. So \u0393^r_{tr} is actually zero. Earlier calculation must have been incorrect. Therefore, \u0393^r_{tr}=0.\n\nTherefore, the original count for upper index r is four components: \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}.\n\nWait, so that's four non-zero Christoffel symbols for upper index r.\n\nNow upper index \u03b8 (2):\n\nLet's consider \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03bc\u03bd}. These would involve derivatives of the metric components with respect to \u03b8 and r. For example, \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} would be non-zero because g_{\u03b8\u03b8} depends on r. Similarly, \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} is the same due to symmetry.\n\nLet's compute \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03c3} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{r\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{r\u03b8} ]\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, g^{\u03b8\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=\u03b8. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03b8} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8} + \u2202_\u03b8 g_{r\u03b8} - \u2202_\u03b8 g_{r\u03b8} ]\n\nBut g_{r\u03b8}=0, so the last two terms cancel. Thus:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03b8} \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8} \n\ng_{\u03b8\u03b8}=r\u00b2, so \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03b8}=2r. g^{\u03b8\u03b8}=1/r\u00b2. Therefore:\n\n= (1/2)(1/r\u00b2)(2r) = 1/r\n\nWhich is non-zero. So \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8}=\u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r}=1/r. So this is a non-zero component.\n\nAnother component \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\nSince g^{\u03b8\u03c3} is non-zero only for \u03c3=\u03b8, so:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03b8\u03b8} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03b8} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03b8} - \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\ng_{\u03c6\u03b8}=0, so first two terms are zero. Third term: \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} = \u2202_\u03b8 (r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = 2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8. So:\n\n= (1/2)(1/r\u00b2)( - 2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 ) = - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8\n\nWhich is non-zero. So \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} is non-zero.\n\nOther components for upper index \u03b8:\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{tt} would involve derivatives of g_{tt} with respect to \u03b8, which is zero. Similarly \u0393^\u03b8_{tr}=0, \u0393^\u03b8_{rr}=0. \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8\u03b8} would require derivatives of g_{\u03b8\u03b8} with respect to \u03b8, but g_{\u03b8\u03b8}=r\u00b2, which is independent of \u03b8, so \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8\u03b8}=0.\n\nSo for upper index \u03b8, the non-zero components are:\n\n1. \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} = \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} \u2192 1 component (since symmetric)\n2. \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2192 1 component\n\nSo total of 2 non-zero components for upper index \u03b8.\n\nUpper index \u03c6 (3):\n\nNow \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03bc\u03bd}. Let's compute these.\n\nFirst, \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c3} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{r\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{r\u03c6} ]\n\ng^{\u03c6\u03c3} is non-zero only when \u03c3=\u03c6. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} [ \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{r\u03c6} - \u2202_\u03c6 g_{r\u03c6} ]\n\nThe last two terms cancel. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6} \n\ng_{\u03c6\u03c6}=r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, so \u2202_r g_{\u03c6\u03c6}=2r sin\u00b2\u03b8. g^{\u03c6\u03c6}=1/(r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8). Therefore:\n\n= (1/2)(1/(r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8))(2r sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) = 1/r\n\nSo \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6}=\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r}=1/r, non-zero.\n\nNext, \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03b8\u03c6} ]\n\nAgain, \u03c3=\u03c6:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8\u03c6} - \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8\u03c6} ]\n\nThe last two terms cancel. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} \n\ng_{\u03c6\u03c6}=r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, so \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c6}= 2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nThus:\n\n= (1/2)(1/(r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8))(2r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) ) = (1/(r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8))(r\u00b2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) = cot\u03b8\n\nSo \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6}=\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8}=cot\u03b8, which is non-zero.\n\nOther components for upper index \u03c6:\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{tt}=0, \u0393^\u03c6_{rr}=0, \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03b8}=0. What about \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03c6}? Let's compute:\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03c6} = (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\n\u03c3=\u03c6:\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6}[ \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} - \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} ]\n\n= (1/2) g^{\u03c6\u03c6} ( \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03c6\u03c6} )\n\nBut g_{\u03c6\u03c6}=r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, and \u2202_\u03c6 of this is zero (since it's independent of \u03c6). So \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03c6}=0.\n\nSo for upper index \u03c6, the non-zero components are:\n\n1. \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} = \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r} \u2192 1 component\n2. \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} = \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8} \u2192 1 component\n\nSo total of 2 non-zero components for upper index \u03c6.\n\nNow, summing up all non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n\n- Upper index t: 1 component (\u0393^t_{tr})\n- Upper index r: 4 components (\u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6})\n- Upper index \u03b8: 2 components (\u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8}, \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6})\n- Upper index \u03c6: 2 components (\u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6}, \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6})\n\nTotal: 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recount. Each of these components, considering their symmetric counterparts. For example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are the same, so counted once. Similarly, \u0393^r_{tt} is symmetric in \u03bc and \u03bd (which are the same here), so only once. For the other upper indices:\n\nUpper index t: \u0393^t_{tr} (which is \u0393^t_{rt}) \u2192 1 component.\n\nUpper index r: \u0393^r_{tt}, \u0393^r_{rr}, \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}, \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} \u2192 4 components, each with \u03bc=\u03bd, so no duplicates.\n\nUpper index \u03b8: \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} (symmetric in r and \u03b8, so counts as 1 component), \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} (\u03bc=\u03bd=\u03c6, but wait, the indices here are \u03b8 and \u03c6? Wait, no. For \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6}, \u03bc=\u03c6, \u03bd=\u03c6? Wait, no. Upper index is \u03b8, lower indices are \u03c6 and \u03c6. So \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} would have \u03bc=\u03c6, \u03bd=\u03c6. So that's one component. But wait, the lower indices are \u03c6 and \u03c6; since the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower indices, this is allowed.\n\nUpper index \u03c6: \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} (symmetric in r and \u03c6), \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} (symmetric in \u03b8 and \u03c6).\n\nSo total non-zero components:\n\nt: 1\n\nr: 4\n\n\u03b8: 2\n\n\u03c6: 2\n\nTotal: 9.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some components. Let me cross-verify with a known source or count.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to recall that in the Schwarzschild metric, there are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols. But I'm not sure; maybe I'm confusing with another metric.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a reference, but since I can't do that, I need to proceed with my calculation.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n\nFor upper index t:\n- \u0393^t_{tr} (and \u0393^t_{rt}), but counted as 1.\n\nUpper index r:\n- \u0393^r_{tt}\n- \u0393^r_{rr}\n- \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}\n- \u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n\nUpper index \u03b8:\n- \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} (and \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r}), 1\n- \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n\nUpper index \u03c6:\n- \u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} (and \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r}), 1\n- \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} (and \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8}), 1\n\nSo that's 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n\nWait, but another possibility is that \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03c6} could be non-zero? Let's check. For \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03c6}:\n\n= (1/2) g^{r\u03c3} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6\u03c3} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8\u03c3} - \u2202_\u03c3 g_{\u03b8\u03c6} ]\n\nBut \u03c3 must be r. So:\n\n= (1/2) g^{rr} [ \u2202_\u03b8 g_{\u03c6r} + \u2202_\u03c6 g_{\u03b8r} - \u2202_r g_{\u03b8\u03c6} ]\n\nAll terms here are zero since g_{\u03c6r}=0, g_{\u03b8r}=0, and g_{\u03b8\u03c6}=0. So \u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03c6}=0.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations would likely be zero.\n\nThus, total of 9 non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\nBut I thought there were more. Alternatively, maybe I missed some components. Let me check another approach.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric in the usual coordinates has the following non-zero Christoffel symbols (as per standard references):\n\n\u0393^t_{tr} = M/(r(r - 2M))\n\n\u0393^r_{tt} = M(r - 2M)/r\u00b3\n\n\u0393^r_{rr} = -M/(r(r - 2M))\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} = -(r - 2M)\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} = -(r - 2M) sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} = 1/r\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} = -sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} = 1/r\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} = cot\u03b8\n\nThese are 9 distinct non-zero Christoffel symbols. Hence, the answer should be 9.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols. Since Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower indices, some components are duplicates. For example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are the same. However, the question counts them as separate entries only if the indices are different. But no, the Christoffel symbols \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} are symmetric in \u03bc and \u03bd, so \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bc\u03bd} and \u0393^\u03c1_{\u03bd\u03bc} are the same. Therefore, each unique combination of \u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd where \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd determines a unique component. However, when counting the number of non-zero components, we need to consider all possible (\u03bc, \u03bd) pairs, but since they are symmetric, for \u03bc \u2260 \u03bd, the component is counted once. But in reality, for example, \u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} and \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} are the same component. Therefore, when counting the total number of non-zero components, we count each unique (\u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd) where \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd, but the question is phrased as \"how many non-zero Christoffel symbols \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 are non-zero?\" The notation \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 implies that \u03bc and \u03bd are symmetric, so each distinct triplet (\u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd) where \u03bc and \u03bd can be in any order counts as a single component. Wait, no. In the Christoffel symbol, \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 and \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1 are the same, so when listing all possible combinations, for \u03bc \u2260 \u03bd, each unordered pair counts once. But the problem just asks \"how many are non-zero\", regardless of their symmetry. However, in reality, the answer depends on whether \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 and \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1 are considered the same component or separate. If the question considers \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 and \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1 as separate symbols, even though they are equal, then for each \u03bc \u2260 \u03bd pair, there are two entries but they are equal. However, the standard count treats them as the same component because of their symmetry. But the question doesn't specify, so we need to clarify.\n\nIn the context of general relativity, Christoffel symbols are symmetric in the lower two indices, so \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 = \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1. Therefore, when counting the number of independent non-zero components, we consider \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd. However, if the question is asking for the total number of components that are non-zero, regardless of their symmetry, then for each \u03bc \u2260 \u03bd, both \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 and \u0393_{\u03bd\u03bc}^\u03c1 are non-zero, but they are equal. But since they are the same value, but different indices, depending on the problem's intention.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how many non-zero Christoffel symbols \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 are non-zero?\" So, for example, if \u0393_{tr}^r is non-zero, then \u0393_{rt}^r is also non-zero because it's symmetric. But they are considered different components. Wait, no. The standard way is to consider \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 as components where \u03bc and \u03bd are indices without ordering. But technically, the indices are ordered, but due to symmetry, the component for \u03bc,\u03bd is the same as \u03bd,\u03bc. So when counting the total number of non-zero components, you can either count them as separate (which would double-count some) or as unique pairs. \n\nBut the question might be expecting the total number including symmetric counterparts. For example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are the same component, so counted once. Whereas \u0393^r_{tt} is counted once. However, in actual calculation, each combination of \u03bc and \u03bd (without considering symmetry) may be considered. But in reality, due to the symmetry, they are not independent. So to avoid double-counting, the correct count is the number of unique (\u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd) with \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd. But how does this translate to the total number of non-zero components when considering all possible \u03bc and \u03bd?\n\nTaking the list from before:\n\n\u0393^t_{tr} (includes \u0393^t_{rt})\n\n\u0393^r_{tt}\n\n\u0393^r_{rr}\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8}\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} (includes \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r})\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6}\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} (includes \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r})\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} (includes \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8})\n\nSo that's 9 unique components when considering \u03bc \u2264 \u03bd. However, if we count all possible \u03bc and \u03bd without considering symmetry, then for example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are both considered non-zero but are equal. So in that case, the total number would be higher.\n\nBut I think the question is asking for the number of non-zero components, taking into account the symmetry. So for each \u0393_{\u03bc\u03bd}^\u03c1 where \u03bc and \u03bd can be in any order, but each unique combination is counted once. Therefore, the answer would be 9.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider a standard source. For example, the Schwarzschild metric has the following non-zero Christoffel symbols (in (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) coordinates):\n\n\u0393^t_{tr} = \u0393^t_{rt} = M/(r(r-2M))\n\n\u0393^r_{tt} = (M(r-2M))/r^3\n\n\u0393^r_{rr} = -M/(r(r-2M))\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03b8\u03b8} = -(r-2M)\n\n\u0393^r_{\u03c6\u03c6} = -(r-2M) sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{r\u03b8} = \u0393^\u03b8_{\u03b8r} = 1/r\n\n\u0393^\u03b8_{\u03c6\u03c6} = -sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{r\u03c6} = \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6r} = 1/r\n\n\u0393^\u03c6_{\u03b8\u03c6} = \u0393^\u03c6_{\u03c6\u03b8} = cot\u03b8\n\nSo these are 9 unique components when considering the symmetry (since, for example, \u0393^t_{tr} and \u0393^t_{rt} are the same component). Therefore, the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is 9.",
