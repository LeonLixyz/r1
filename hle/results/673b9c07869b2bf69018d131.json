  "question": "What rotational shoulder joint movement is involved in holding the arms 2nd position in ballet?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me think. The question is about the rotational shoulder joint movement involved in holding the arms in the 2nd position in ballet. Hmm. So, first, I need to recall what the 2nd position looks like. In ballet, the arms are out to the sides, slightly rounded, I think at about shoulder height or a bit lower. So the arms are abducted, right? But the question specifies rotational movement. Shoulder joint movements can be a bit tricky.\n\nThe options would likely include terms like medial rotation, lateral rotation, abduction, adduction, etc. But since it's rotational, we can narrow it down to medial or lateral rotation. Now, when the arm is abducted (held out to the side), what rotation would be involved in maintaining that position. Wait, the 2nd position in ballet\u2014the palms are usually facing forward or maybe slightly downward. Let me visualize: if the arms are out to the sides with elbows slightly bent and palms facing forward, that might require some lateral rotation of the shoulder. Because medial rotation would turn the palm backward. Wait, no. Let me think. When you laterally rotate the humerus, the palm turns upward or forward. Medial rotation would turn the palm downward or backward. So in 2nd position, if the arms are out and palms are facing forward, that's lateral rotation. Because to get the palm forward, the shoulder is laterally rotated. But maybe in ballet, the exact positioning might vary. Alternatively, maybe it's just abduction without rotation. But the question specifically asks about rotational movement. So if abduction is the main movement, but there's an element of rotation to position the palm direction. So the answer would be lateral rotation. Because when you abduct the arm, the default might have the palm facing medially, but to turn the palm forward, you need lateral rotation. So the rotational component here is lateral rotation. Therefore, the movement involved is lateral rotation of the shoulder joint.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: In ballet's 2nd position, the arms are held out to the sides (abducted) with palms typically facing forward. To achieve this palm orientation, the humerus undergoes lateral (external) rotation at the shoulder joint. Medial rotation would turn the palms backward, which is not the case here. While abduction positions the arms horizontally, the rotational component ensuring the palms face forward is lateral rotation.\n\nAnswer: Lateral rotation  \nConfidence: 90%",
