  "question": "What achiral and non polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity. Hmm, I need to recall some crystallography here.\n\nFirst, optical activity in crystals is generally possible only in certain crystal systems. I remember that optical activity, which is the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light, occurs in crystals that lack a center of symmetry, a mirror plane, or an inversion center. So, the crystal must be non-centrosymmetric.\n\nNow, the question specifies achiral and non-polar. Wait, chiral structures are those that are not superimposable on their mirror images, but achiral means they are superimposable. However, optical activity is usually associated with chiral substances. But here, the question says achiral. That's confusing. Maybe I need to check if there are achiral crystal classes that can still show optical activity. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion arises because some crystal classes even if they are not chiral (achiral) can still be optically active due to their symmetry. But how? Let me think. Optical activity can also occur in certain non-chiral crystals if they have specific symmetries that allow rotation of the plane of polarization. For example, quartz is chiral (enantiomorphic), but maybe other classes even without chirality can have this property. Wait, no, quartz is a chiral crystal. But maybe some other classes.\n\nLet me check the crystal classes. There are 32 crystal classes (point groups). Out of these, the ones that are non-centrosymmetric and allow optical activity. The 21 non-centrosymmetric classes. But among these, some are chiral and some are not. Wait, for optical activity, maybe the crystal must be enantiomorphic (chiral). So, if the crystal is achiral (not enantiomorphic), can it still exhibit optical activity? I think in such cases, maybe not. Because enantiomorphic pairs are responsible for optical activity. But perhaps in some cases, even non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystals can have optical activity due to their symmetry. Wait, but I might be mixing up different concepts.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be a bit of a trick. For example, if the crystal is non-polar (i.e., doesn't have a polar axis) and achiral, but still allows optical activity. But typically, optical activity requires the absence of certain symmetry elements. Let me recall Neumann's principle: the physical properties of a crystal must include the symmetry elements of the crystal's point group. So, optical activity (a tensor property) is allowed if the point group doesn't have certain symmetries.\n\nThe necessary condition for optical activity is that the crystal lacks a center of symmetry, mirror planes, and improper rotation axes (like S4, which is a rotoinversion). So, the crystal classes that are non-centrosymmetric and without mirror planes or improper axes. Among the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, some are chiral (enantiomorphic) and some are not. The chiral ones are the enantiomorphic classes, which are the 11 pairs (like 432 and its enantiomer?), but I'm not sure. Wait, the enantiomorphic classes are those that lack any improper rotations, so they are the ones in which the point group is purely rotational. The enantiomorphic point groups are the 11 that are chiral. The other non-centrosymmetric point groups (the non-enantiomorphic ones) would have some mirror planes or improper axes, thus making them achiral but still non-centrosymmetric. But optical activity is possible only in the enantiomorphic (chiral) classes. Wait, but I thought that even some non-chiral non-centrosymmetric crystals could show optical activity. For example, in some piezoelectric crystals. But maybe not. Because if a crystal has a mirror plane, then the optical activity would be canceled. Because the mirror plane would reverse the direction of rotation, leading to no net optical activity. So, only crystals without any mirror planes or inversion centers can display optical activity. Thus, the enantiomorphic (chiral) classes. But the question says \"achiral and non-polar\", so this is confusing. If a crystal is achiral, then it has mirror planes or improper rotations, so according to that reasoning, it would not show optical activity. But the question is asking for achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity. That seems contradictory unless there's an exception.\n\nWait, maybe in some non-enantiomorphic (achiral) classes, there's still no mirror planes? Wait, no. The enantiomorphic point groups are those that only have proper rotations. So, any non-enantiomorphic non-centrosymmetric point group would have either a mirror plane or an improper rotation. So, for example, the point group mm2 is non-centrosymmetric but has mirror planes. Thus, it's achiral but has mirror planes. So, such crystals would not exhibit optical activity. Therefore, only the enantiomorphic (chiral) classes can have optical activity. Therefore, the answer would be that there are no achiral, non-polar crystal classes that allow optical activity. But the question is phrased as asking what achiral and non-polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity. So perhaps the answer is none? But the user is expecting some options. Let me check some resources.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think. For instance, the crystal class 422 is a chiral (enantiomorphic) class. So, if the crystal is in that class, it's chiral. But if the question is about achiral crystals, then classes like 4mm, which have mirror planes, are achiral but non-centrosymmetric. However, the presence of mirror planes would inhibit optical activity. Thus, in such classes, optical activity is not possible. So, perhaps there are no achiral, non-polar crystal classes that allow optical activity. Therefore, the answer is none. But maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the question says \"non-polar\" which refers to the crystal class not having a polar axis. A polar axis is one where the direction matters, like in pyroelectric crystals. So, non-polar crystal classes are those that don't have a unique polar direction. So, maybe in some classes that are non-polar and achiral, but still allow optical activity. Wait, but if they are non-polar, does that relate to symmetry elements? Polar crystals belong to polar point groups, which are those that have a unique axis (like Cnv, Cn, etc. for certain n). So, non-polar would be the non-polar point groups. So, combining non-polar, achiral, and allowing optical activity.\n\nWait, if the crystal is non-polar, then it's in a non-polar point group. The polar point groups are those where there's a direction that is not equivalent to its opposite (like a polar axis). So, non-polar point groups are those without such an axis. Now, the optical activity requires non-centrosymmetric and no mirrors or improper rotations. But if the crystal is non-polar (so no polar axis) and achiral (so has some mirror or improper rotation), then how can it allow optical activity? Because mirrors would forbid it. So, perhaps there are no such crystal classes. Therefore, the answer is that none of the achiral and non-polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity. Hence, the answer is none. But the user must have a specific answer in mind. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a class. Let me list the non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. They are 21 in total. Let's see. The non-centrosymmetric classes include:\n\nTriclinic: 1, -1 (but -1 is centrosymmetric, so only 1.\n\nWait, but the 32 crystal classes (point groups) are divided into centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric. The 21 non-centrosymmetric ones are those without inversion symmetry. So, for example, in the cubic system, the non-centrosymmetric classes include 23, 432, -43m, etc. The enantiomorphic (chiral) classes are the ones that have only proper rotations. For example, in cubic, 23 and 432 are enantiomorphic. The others like -43m are not. So, non-enantiomorphic non-centrosymmetric classes would have mirror planes or improper axes. So, in such classes, even though they are non-centrosymmetric, the presence of mirrors or improper rotations prevents optical activity. Thus, only the enantiomorphic (chiral) classes allow optical activity. Since the question asks for achiral (non-enantiomorphic) classes, which must have mirrors or improper rotations, they cannot have optical activity. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such crystal classes. So the correct answer is none. But let me check some references. Wait, according to some sources, optical activity is possible only in enantiomorphic (chiral) crystals. So, if the crystal is achiral (i.e., not enantiomorphic), then it cannot exhibit optical activity. Therefore, the answer would be that there are no achiral and non-polar crystal classes with the required symmetry for optical activity. Hence, the answer is that none of them do. Therefore, the answer options would likely list \"None\" as an option. But since the user hasn't given options, but the way the answer is structured, we need to state the answer. But in the absence of options, perhaps the answer is that no achiral and non-polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry. So the answer is None.\n",
