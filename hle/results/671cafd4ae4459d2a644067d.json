  "question": "In the episode of Spongebob Squarepants, \"The Camping Episode\", what type of animal does Squidward imitate to attract a sea bear?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is about the Spongebob episode \"The Camping Episode\" where Squidward imitates an animal to attract a sea bear. I need to recall what animal that was.\n\nFirst, I remember that in this episode, Spongebob and Patrick are camping in Squidward's yard, and they mention the dangers of sea bears. Squidward doesn't believe them and ends up provoking a sea bear by doing something he shouldn't. But the specific part is when Squidward tries to imitate an animal to attract the sea bear, right?\n\nWait, the sea bear is attracted by certain actions. The characters talk about how to avoid attracting them, like not doing a sea bear call, which is imitating their natural predator. Oh right! The sea bear's natural enemy is the sea rhinoceros. So, if you imitate a sea rhinoceros, that would attract a sea bear because they come to defend their territory or something like that. So Squidward, trying to mock Spongebob and Patrick, probably imitates the sea rhinoceros, thinking they're just being silly, but it actually works and the sea bear shows up.\n\nSo the answer should be a sea rhinoceros. Let me double-check. The steps they take to avoid attracting the sea bear include not making a fire, not wearing a sombrero in a goofy fashion, and avoiding the sea rhinoceros call. Squidward ends up doing all the things they warned against, including the call. Yeah, that's the one. The animal imitated is a sea rhinoceros.\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: In \"The Camping Episode,\" Squidward mocks Spongebob and Patrick's warnings about sea bears by deliberately performing actions that attract them, including imitating the sea rhinoceros. Sea bears are provoked by the call of their natural predator, the sea rhinoceros, which is why Squidward's imitation results in a sea bear attack.  \nAnswer: Sea Rhinoceros  \nConfidence: 95%",
