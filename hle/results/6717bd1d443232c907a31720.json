  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the new matrix C after reducing the given system to observer canonical form using duality. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the observer canonical form is. I remember that there's a duality between controllable and observable forms. So, if a system is observable, its dual is controllable, and vice versa. The idea is to use that duality to transform the original system into observer canonical form by first converting the dual system into controller canonical form and then taking the transpose or something like that.\n\nThe given system is x(k+1) = A x(k) and y(k) = C x(k). The matrices are A = [[1,1,0], [2,1,1], [0,2,0]] and C = [[0,1,0], [1,1,0]]. The problem asks for the new C matrix after transformation. Wait, in the observer canonical form, the output matrix usually has a specific structure, like the first block being identity and the rest zero, but that might depend on the observability indices. \n\nSince we have two outputs (C has two rows), the system might split into two observable subsystems. But maybe I should approach this through duality. The dual system of (A, C) is (A', C', B') where B would be C^T in this case. Wait, duality swaps the roles of B and C, and transposes the matrices. So the dual system is (A_transpose, B_transpose, C_transpose) where original system is (A, B, C). Wait, in the original system here, B isn't given because it's a system without a control input, just the autonomous system. But maybe the approach is to consider the dual system for observability. \n\nWait, the standard approach for reducing to observer canonical form using duality is to:\n\n1. Find the dual system by taking (A_transpose, C_transpose, B_transpose, D_transpose). Since our original system doesn't have a B (uncontrolled), maybe D is not present. But perhaps for the purpose of duality, since the original system is x(k+1) = A x(k), y = C x(k), the dual system would be z(k+1) = A^T z(k) + C^T u(k), and the output is something else. Wait, maybe the duality here is between controllability and observability. So if the original system is observable, then the dual is controllable. So if we can transform the dual system into controller canonical form, then the original system transformed into observer canonical form would be the dual of that.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Compute the observability matrix of the original system. If it's observable, then the dual system is controllable. Then, transform the dual system into controller canonical form, then the observer canonical form of the original system is the dual of that transformation.\n\nBut perhaps another way is to compute the transformation matrix for the dual system to controller form and then apply the transpose or inverse transpose to the original system.\n\nAlternatively, the observer canonical form can be obtained by first converting the dual system to controller canonical form and then transposing back. So here's the process:\n\n1. Find the dual system: A_d = A^T, B_d = C^T, C_d = B^T (but since the original system has no B, maybe the dual system's C_d is not needed here. Wait, maybe the approach is that since the original system is (A, C), the dual is (A^T, C^T, ...). But perhaps for the purpose of using controllability to get the controller form for the dual system, then converting back.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps properly.\n\nFirst, the original system is (A, C). To use duality for observer canonical form, we can:\n\n1. Consider the dual system (A^T, C^T, something). The controllability of the dual system is equivalent to the observability of the original system. So, first check if the original system is observable. If it is, then the dual system is controllable, and we can transform it into controller canonical form.\n\n2. Once the dual system is in controller canonical form, the original system in observer canonical form is obtained by transposing the matrices appropriately.\n\nBut how exactly does this work? Let me think. Suppose we have the dual system (A', B', C') where A' = A^T and B' = C^T. Then, if we transform this dual system into controller canonical form using a transformation matrix T, then the observer canonical form of the original system would be T^{-T} A T^T and so on? Wait, maybe not. Let's recall that for a system (A, B, C), the dual is (A^T, C^T, B^T). So the original system's output matrix C becomes the dual's input matrix B_d = C^T. So, in the dual system, the input matrix is B_d = C^T. \n\nNow, if the dual system is controllable (i.e., original system is observable), then we can transform it into controller canonical form. Let's call the transformation matrix for the dual system T. The controller canonical form for the dual system would have A'_ccf = T^{-1} A^T T and B'_ccf = T^{-1} C^T.\n\nThen, the observer canonical form of the original system would be the dual of this controller canonical form. So, the observer form's A matrix would be (A'_ccf)^T = T^T A (T^{-1})^T, and the C matrix would be (B'_ccf)^T = C T^{-T} (since B'_ccf is T^{-1} C^T, so its transpose is C T^{-T} ). Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the observer canonical form for the original system (A, C) can be obtained by first converting the dual system (A^T, C^T) into controller canonical form, then taking the transpose. Let me check this.\n\nSuppose the dual system is (A^T, C^T). The controller canonical form (CCF) of the dual system is achieved via a transformation matrix T such that A_ccf = T^{-1} A^T T and B_ccf = T^{-1} C^T. The observer canonical form (OCF) of the original system would then have matrices A_ocf = A_ccf^T = T^T A (T^{-1})^T and C_ocf = B_ccf^T = (T^{-1} C^T)^T = C T^{-T}.\n\nBut maybe more straightforwardly, the observer canonical form's C matrix will be in a specific form, perhaps with ones and zeros depending on the observability indices. However, since the original C matrix has two rows, the system is a multi-output system, so the observer canonical form might be in a block diagonal form based on the observability indices.\n\nAlternatively, the observer canonical form for multi-output systems can be more complex, but maybe here, since we are using duality, we can proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the observability matrix of the original system. If it's full rank, then the system is observable, and we can proceed. Then, since the dual system is controllable, transform it to controller canonical form, and then transpose back.\n\nWait, perhaps the main steps are:\n\n1. Check observability of the original system by computing the observability matrix. If it's rank n (3), then it's observable. Let's do that first.\n\nOriginal system has C = [[0,1,0], [1,1,0]]. The observability matrix O is constructed as [C; C A; C A^2]. Let's compute O.\n\nFirst, compute C:\n\nC1 = [0,1,0]\nC2 = [1,1,0]\n\nCompute C*A:\n\nC1*A = [0,1,0] * [[1,1,0], [2,1,1], [0,2,0]] = [2,1,1]\n\nC2*A = [1,1,0] * A = [1*1 +1*2 +0*0, 1*1 +1*1 +0*2, 1*0 +1*1 +0*0] = [1+2, 1+1, 1] = [3, 2, 1]\n\nWait, matrix multiplication is row by column. Let me compute each entry properly.\n\nFor C1 (row vector) multiplied by A:\n\nFirst element: 0*1 + 1*2 + 0*0 = 2\nSecond element: 0*1 +1*1 +0*2 =1\nThird element:0*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1\nSo C1*A is [2,1,1]\n\nSimilarly, C2 (row vector) times A:\n\nFirst element:1*1 +1*2 +0*0 = 1 +2 =3\nSecond element:1*1 +1*1 +0*2 =1 +1 =2\nThird element:1*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1\nSo C2*A is [3,2,1]\n\nNow, next layer: C*A^2. Compute A^2 first.\n\nA is:\nRow 1: 1,1,0\nRow 2:2,1,1\nRow3:0,2,0\n\nCompute A^2 = A*A:\n\nRow 1 of A multiplied by columns of A:\n\nFirst element:1*1 +1*2 +0*0 = 1 +2 =3\nSecond element:1*1 +1*1 +0*2 =1 +1=2\nThird element:1*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1\n\nRow 2:\n\n2*1 +1*2 +1*0 =2+2=4\n2*1 +1*1 +1*2 =2+1+2=5\n2*0 +1*1 +1*0=1\n\nRow3:\n\n0*1 +2*2 +0*0=4\n0*1 +2*1 +0*2=2\n0*0 +2*1 +0*0=2\n\nSo A^2 is:\n\n[[3, 2, 1],\n [4,5,1],\n [4,2,2]]\n\nNow compute C1*A^2 and C2*A^2.\n\nC1*A^2: [0,1,0] * A^2 = [4,5,1] (since it's the second row of A^2)\n\nC2*A^2: [1,1,0] * A^2. Let's compute element-wise:\n\nFirst element:1*3 +1*4 +0*4 =3+4=7\nSecond element:1*2 +1*5 +0*2 =2+5=7\nThird element:1*1 +1*1 +0*2 =1+1=2\n\nSo C2*A^2 is [7,7,2]\n\nNow, the observability matrix O is:\n\nC1       [0,1,0]\nC2       [1,1,0]\nC1*A     [2,1,1]\nC2*A     [3,2,1]\nC1*A^2  [4,5,1]\nC2*A^2  [7,7,2]\n\nSo O is a 6x3 matrix. Let's check its rank. We can write it out:\n\nRow1: 0 1 0\nRow2:1 1 0\nRow3:2 1 1\nRow4:3 2 1\nRow5:4 5 1\nRow6:7 7 2\n\nTo compute the rank, we can see if any 3 rows are linearly independent. Let's check the first three rows:\n\nRows 1,2,3:\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n2 1 1\n\nThe determinant of the matrix formed by these three rows is:\n\n| 0 1 0 |\n\n|1 1 0 | \n\n|2 1 1 |\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\n= 0*(1*1 - 0*1) -1*(1*1 -0*2) +0*(1*1 -1*2)\n\n= 0 -1*(1 -0) +0 = -1. So determinant is -1 \u2260 0. Therefore, the first three rows are linearly independent, so the observability matrix has rank at least 3. Since the state is 3-dimensional, the system is observable. Therefore, the dual system is controllable, which allows us to proceed.\n\nNow, the dual system is (A^T, C^T). The dual system's A matrix is A^T, and B matrix is C^T. Wait, since the original system is x(k+1) = A x(k), y = C x(k). The dual system (for controllability) would be z(k+1) = A^T z(k) + C^T u(k). So the dual system has input matrix B_d = C^T. Therefore, to transform the dual system into controller canonical form, we need to find a transformation matrix T such that T^{-1} A^T T is in controller form and T^{-1} C^T has the structure [0; ...; 1].\n\nBut since the original C has two rows, the dual system has two inputs (since B_d = C^T is a 3x2 matrix). Wait, no. Wait, in the original system, C is 2x3, so C^T is 3x2. Therefore, the dual system has two inputs, each being a 3-dimensional vector. So the dual system is a multi-input system. Converting a multi-input system to controller canonical form is more involved. In contrast to the single-input case where the controller form is unique, for multi-input systems, the form can vary based on controllability indices. However, since the original system has two outputs, the dual system has two inputs. So the controllability indices for the dual system would need to sum to n=3. The possible controllability indices could be (2,1) or other combinations. But this might complicate things. However, since in the problem statement we are to use duality to get the observer canonical form, perhaps we can use the fact that for each output, we can create a subsystem in observer form. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the system can be transformed into a single observer canonical form despite multiple outputs. But I'm not sure. Let me try to recall.\n\nAlternatively, the observer canonical form for multiple outputs can be constructed by considering the observability indices. The observability indices are determined by the number of linearly independent rows contributed by each output in the observability matrix. Let's see. The original C matrix has two rows. In the observability matrix O, the first block is C, then C A, etc. Let's check how the rows of O are built:\n\nFrom the original O matrix, the rows contributed by C1 and C2 are:\n\nRows 1 (C1), 2 (C2), 3 (C1 A), 4 (C2 A), 5 (C1 A\u00b2), 6 (C2 A\u00b2). The rank is 3, so the observability indices are determined by how these rows contribute to the rank. Let's see which rows are linearly independent. For example, the first two rows (C1 and C2) are [0,1,0] and [1,1,0]. Let's see if they are linearly independent. The determinant of the matrix formed by rows 1 and 2 would be the determinant of a 2x3 matrix, which isn't square, but their rank is 2. So they contribute 2 to the rank, and adding C1 A (row3: [2,1,1]) gives the third linearly independent row. So the observability indices could be \u03bc1=2 and \u03bc2=1, because C1 contributes two rows (row1 and row3 and row5?), but maybe another way. Wait, the standard method for determining observability indices is the following: Start with the first output, add rows from the observability matrix until the rank increases. Then proceed with the next output.\n\nAlternatively, given the observability matrix O, the procedure is:\n\nInitialize: k=1, current rank r=0.\n\nFor each output i=1 to p (here p=2):\n\nFor j=0,1,..., compute the rank when adding C_i A^j. Let me try to compute.\n\nStart with O_0 = empty matrix. Then:\n\nAdd rows from C1 and C2.\n\nFirst, add C1 (row1): rank 1.\n\nAdd C2 (row2): rank becomes 2.\n\nThen add C1 A (row3): rank becomes 3. So the first output (C1) contributes two rows (row1 and row3), and the second output (C2) contributes one row (row2). Therefore, the observability indices are \u03bc1=2 and \u03bc2=1. Their sum is 3, which is the system's order. Hence, this makes sense. Therefore, the observer canonical form would have two blocks, one of size 2x2 and another 1x1. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, when using duality, since the dual system has two inputs, we need to transform it into controller canonical form with controllability indices (2,1). However, transforming a multi-input system into controller form is more complex. But since the problem states to use duality, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe dual system is (A^T, B_d = C^T), with A^T being:\n\nOriginal A:\n\n1 1 0\n\n2 1 1\n\n0 2 0\n\nSo A^T is:\n\n1 2 0\n\n1 1 2\n\n0 1 0\n\nAnd B_d = C^T, which is:\n\nC is two rows: [0,1,0] and [1,1,0], so C^T is:\n\nFirst column: 0,1,0\n\nSecond column:1,1,0\n\nSo B_d is:\n\n[0 1\n\n1 1\n\n0 0]\n\nSo the dual system is:\n\nz(k+1) = A^T z(k) + B_d u(k)\n\nNow, to convert this dual system into controller canonical form. But since it's a multi-input system (two inputs), we need to use the controllability indices. The controllability indices for the dual system would be the observability indices of the original system, which we determined as \u03bc1=2 and \u03bc2=1. Therefore, the controllability indices for the dual system are the same, \u03c11=2 and \u03c12=1. Wait, but controllability indices for a system with m inputs are m integers that sum to n. Here, m=2, n=3, so \u03c11 + \u03c12 = 3. The possible indices are 2 and 1. So the controller canonical form for the dual system would be in a block form where the first block is 2x2 and the second is 1x1. The transformation matrix for the dual system can be constructed using the controllability matrix.\n\nThe controllability matrix for the dual system is:\n\nK_d = [B_d, A^T B_d, (A^T)^2 B_d]\n\nCompute K_d:\n\nFirst, compute A^T B_d:\n\nA^T is:\n\n[1 2 0\n\n1 1 2\n\n0 1 0]\n\nMultiply by B_d:\n\nB_d columns are [0,1,0] and [1,1,0].\n\nCompute first column of A^T B_d:\n\nA^T * [0;1;0] = [1*0 +2*1 +0*0, ...] = 2 (first entry), 1*0 +1*1 +2*0 =1, 0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1. So [2,1,1]^T.\n\nSecond column: A^T * [1;1;0] = [1*1 +2*1 +0*0 =3; 1*1 +1*1 +2*0=2; 0*1 +1*1 +0*0=1]. So [3,2,1]^T.\n\nThus, A^T B_d = [[2,3],[1,2],[1,1]]\n\nSimilarly, compute (A^T)^2:\n\nA^T squared is A^T * A^T:\n\nRow 1 of A^T: [1,2,0]. Multiply by A^T columns:\n\nFirst element:1*1 +2*1 +0*0 =3\n\nSecond element:1*2 +2*1 +0*1 =2 +2=4\n\nThird element:1*0 +2*2 +0*0=4\n\nRow 2 of A^T: [1,1,2]. Multiply by A^T columns:\n\nFirst column:1*1 +1*1 +2*0=2\n\nSecond column:1*2 +1*1 +2*1=2 +1 +2=5\n\nThird column:1*0 +1*2 +2*0=2\n\nRow 3 of A^T: [0,1,0]. Multiply by A^T columns:\n\nFirst column:0*1 +1*1 +0*0=1\n\nSecond column:0*2 +1*1 +0*1=1\n\nThird column:0*0 +1*2 +0*0=2\n\nSo (A^T)^2 is:\n\n[3,4,4\n\n2,5,2\n\n1,1,2]\n\nNow compute (A^T)^2 B_d:\n\nMultiply (A^T)^2 with B_d:\n\nFirst column of B_d is [0;1;0], second is [1;1;0].\n\nCompute (A^T)^2 * [0;1;0]:\n\nRow1:3*0 +4*1 +4*0=4\n\nRow2:2*0 +5*1 +2*0=5\n\nRow3:1*0 +1*1 +2*0=1\n\nSo first column is [4;5;1]\n\nSecond column: (A^T)^2 * [1;1;0]:\n\nRow1:3*1 +4*1 +4*0=7\n\nRow2:2*1 +5*1 +2*0=7\n\nRow3:1*1 +1*1 +2*0=2\n\nSo second column is [7;7;2]\n\nThus, (A^T)^2 B_d is [[4,7],[5,7],[1,2]]\n\nTherefore, the controllability matrix K_d for the dual system is:\n\nColumns from B_d: [0,1,0] and [1,1,0]\n\nThen A^T B_d columns: [2,1,1] and [3,2,1]\n\nThen (A^T)^2 B_d columns: [4,5,1] and [7,7,2]\n\nSo K_d is the concatenation:\n\n[0,1,2,3,4,7\n\n1,1,1,2,5,7\n\n0,0,1,1,1,2]\n\nWait, but the controllability matrix for the dual system is [B_d, A^T B_d, (A^T)^2 B_d], which has 3*2=6 columns. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, B_d is 3x2, so K_d is 3x6 matrix:\n\nColumns:\n\n1: 0,1,0 (first column of B_d)\n\n2:1,1,0 (second column of B_d)\n\n3:2,1,1 (first column of A^T B_d)\n\n4:3,2,1 (second column of A^T B_d)\n\n5:4,5,1 (first column of (A^T)^2 B_d)\n\n6:7,7,2 (second column of (A^T)^2 B_d)\n\nNow, we need to pick a basis from K_d. Since the dual system is controllable (original system is observable), the controllability matrix has rank 3. To form the transformation matrix T, we need to select linearly independent columns from K_d. Let's select the first three columns that are linearly independent.\n\nCheck the rank of the first three columns:\n\nColumns 1, 2, 3:\n\n0 1 2\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 0 1\n\nThe determinant of this 3x3 matrix is:\n\n0*(1*1 - 1*0) - 1*(1*1 -1*0) + 2*(1*0 -1*0) = 0 -1*(1) + 2*0 = -1 \u2260 0. Therefore, columns 1,2,3 are linearly independent. So we can take columns 1,2,3 from K_d as the basis. Wait, but in controllability matrix for multi-input systems, the standard approach is to pick columns sequentially until we get n linearly independent columns. For a system with m inputs, the method is to take the first m columns, then the next m, etc., until rank is achieved. But here, m=2, n=3. So we need to pick two columns from B_d, then one more from A^T B_d to get rank 3. Let me see:\n\nColumns 1,2 (from B_d): matrix:\n\n0 1\n\n1 1\n\n0 0\n\nRank 2? Determinant of the first two rows: determinant is 0*1 -1*1 = -1 \u22600, so yes, rank 2.\n\nThen, adding column3 (first column of A^T B_d), which is [2,1,1]^T. Let's check if the three vectors are independent. As before, columns 1,2,3 form a matrix with determinant -1, so they are linearly independent. Therefore, the transformation matrix T can be formed by these three columns. But in controller canonical form for multi-input systems, we need to arrange the transformation matrix according to the controllability indices. However, this might get complicated, but let me try. \n\nThe transformation matrix T is built as follows for the controller form with controllability indices \u03c11=2 and \u03c12=1. The procedure is to take the first \u03c11 columns from the controllability matrix for the first input, and the first \u03c12 columns for the second input. Wait, since controllability indices are \u03c11=2 and \u03c12=1, this means that the first input channel requires 2 steps to span the space, and the second input requires 1. \n\nSo for input 1 (first column of B_d), we take B_d1, A^T B_d1, ..., A^T^{\u03c11-1} B_d1. Similarly for input 2: B_d2, A^T B_d2, ... A^T^{\u03c12-1} B_d2. So with \u03c11=2 and \u03c12=1, the columns of T should be [B_d1, A^T B_d1, B_d2].\n\nLet's verify:\n\nB_d1 is the first column of B_d: [0;1;0]\n\nA^T B_d1 is [2;1;1] (from earlier calculation)\n\nB_d2 is the second column of B_d: [1;1;0]\n\nSo T = [B_d1, A^T B_d1, B_d2] = columns:\n\n0,2,1\n\n1,1,1\n\n0,1,0\n\nCompute the determinant of T:\n\n|0 2 1|\n\n|1 1 1|\n\n|0 1 0|\n\nThe determinant is 0*(1*0 -1*1) -2*(1*0 -1*0) +1*(1*1 -1*0) = 0 -0 +1*(1) =1 \u22600. So T is invertible.\n\nThus, the transformation matrix T is:\n\n[0 2 1\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0]\n\nNow, the controller canonical form for the dual system is given by:\n\nA_ccf = T^{-1} A^T T\n\nB_ccf = T^{-1} B_d\n\nBut since we need the observer canonical form of the original system, which is the dual of the controller form of the dual system. The observer canonical form matrices would be:\n\nA_ocf = A_ccf^T\n\nC_ocf = B_ccf^T\n\nBut I need to verify. Let's think:\n\nThe dual of the controller canonical form (which is in the dual system) gives the observer canonical form of the original system. Therefore, if the dual system in controller form has (A_ccf, B_ccf), then the observer form of the original system is (A_ccf^T, C_ocf = B_ccf^T, ...). Since the original system's output matrix C becomes the dual's input matrix B_d = C^T, the dual system's B_ccf is T^{-1} B_d. Then, the observer canonical form's C matrix is B_ccf^T.\n\nWait, let's define:\n\nThe observer canonical form for the original system is obtained by taking the dual of the controller canonical form of the dual system. So:\n\nOriginal system's observer form:\n\nA_ocf = (T^{-1} A^T T)^T = T^T A (T^{-1})^T\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the C matrix directly. Since in the dual system's controller form, B_ccf = T^{-1} B_d. Then, in the observer form, the C matrix is B_ccf^T. Because in the dual system, the input matrix is B_d = C^T, and after transformation, B_ccf = T^{-1} C^T. Then, the C matrix for the observer form would be (B_ccf)^T = (T^{-1} C^T)^T = C T^{-T}. But since the original C is part of the observer form's C matrix, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the observer canonical form of the original system (A, C) is given by the matrices:\n\nA_ocf = T_obs^{-1} A T_obs\n\nC_ocf = C T_obs\n\nBut how does this relate to the dual system's controller form? Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to make it step by step.\n\nThe standard duality relationship is that the observer canonical form of a system is the dual of the controller canonical form of its dual system. So, if you take the dual system (A^T, C^T), convert it to controller form (A_ccf, B_ccf), then the observer form of the original system is (A_ccf^T, C_ocf = B_ccf^T). So in this case, C_ocf would be B_ccf^T.\n\nGiven that, since in the dual system's controller form, B_ccf = T^{-1} C^T, then C_ocf = (T^{-1} C^T)^T = C T^{-T}.\n\nSo, to find C_ocf, we need to compute C multiplied by T^{-T}.\n\nBut T is the transformation matrix for the dual system, which is [B_d1, A^T B_d1, B_d2] as before.\n\nGiven T:\n\nT = [\n[0, 2, 1],\n[1, 1, 1],\n[0, 1, 0]\n]\n\nFirst, compute T inverse. Let's compute T^{-1}.\n\nGiven T:\n\nRow1:0,2,1\n\nRow2:1,1,1\n\nRow3:0,1,0\n\nWe need to compute the inverse of this matrix. Let me denote T as:\n\n0 2 1\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0\n\nThe determinant of T is 1, as computed earlier.\n\nTo compute T^{-1}, let's use the adjugate matrix.\n\nCompute minors:\n\nFor element (1,1): determinant of submatrix excluding row1, column1:\n\n|1 1|\n\n|1 0| = (1*0 -1*1) = -1. Multiply by (-1)^(1+1)=1 \u2192 -1\n\nElement (1,2): minor for row1, column2 is determinant of:\n\n|1 1|\n\n|0 0| = 0. Multiply by (-1)^(1+2) \u2192 0.\n\nElement (1,3): minor for row1, column3:\n\n|1 1|\n\n|0 1| =1*1 -1*0=1 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(1+3)=1 \u2192 1\n\nSimilarly for other elements:\n\nRow2:\n\nElement (2,1): minor for row2, column1:\n\n|2 1|\n\n|1 0| = (2*0 -1*1) = -1 \u2192 (-1)^(2+1) * (-1) = (-1)^3 * (-1) = 1\n\nElement (2,2): minor for row2, column2:\n\n|0 1|\n\n|0 0| =0 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(2+2)=1 \u2192 0\n\nElement (2,3): minor for row2, column3:\n\n|0 2|\n\n|0 1| =0*1 -2*0=0 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(2+3)= -1 \u2192 0\n\nRow3:\n\nElement (3,1): minor for row3, column1:\n\n|2 1|\n\n|1 1| =2*1 -1*1=1 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(3+1)=1 \u21921\n\nElement (3,2): minor for row3, column2:\n\n|0 1|\n\n|1 1| =0*1 -1*1=-1 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(3+2)= -1 \u2192 1\n\nElement (3,3): minor for row3, column3:\n\n|0 2|\n\n|1 1| =0*1 -2*1 =-2 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(3+3)=1 \u2192 -2\n\nTherefore, the matrix of minors with signs is:\n\nRow1: -1, 0, 1\n\nRow2:1, 0, 0\n\nRow3:1,1,-2\n\nTranspose this matrix to get the adjugate:\n\nOriginal minors matrix:\n\n[-1, 0, 1\n\n1, 0, 0\n\n1,1,-2]\n\nTranspose:\n\n[-1,1,1\n\n0,0,1\n\n1,0,-2]\n\nSo T^{-1} is adjugate divided by determinant (which is 1), so:\n\nT^{-1} = [\n[-1, 1, 1],\n[0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, -2]\n]\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the minors and the adjugate.\n\nWait, the adjugate matrix is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors (minors with signs). Let me verify the minors again.\n\nWait, for element (1,1): the minor is determinant of rows 2-3 and columns 2-3. But wait, the matrix T is 3x3, so removing row1 and column1 gives:\n\nrows 2,3 and columns 2,3:\n\n[1,1\n\n1,0] determinant is (1*0 -1*1) = -1. The cofactor is (-1)^(1+1) * (-1) = -1. So the cofactor for (1,1) is -1.\n\nElement (1,2): minor is determinant of rows 2,3 and columns 1,3 (since column2 is removed):\n\n[1,1\n\n0,0] determinant is 0, cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) *0 =0.\n\nElement (1,3): minor is determinant of rows 2,3 and columns 1,2:\n\n[1,1\n\n0,1] determinant is1*1 -1*0=1. Cofactor is (-1)^(1+3)*1=1.\n\nRow1: [-1, 0, 1]\n\nRow2:\n\nElement (2,1): minor for row2, column1: remove row2 and column1, so rows1,3 and columns2,3:\n\n[0,2,1\n\n0,1,0] \u2192 removing column1, then rows1 and3:\n\nrows1: [2,1]\n\nrow3: [1,0]\n\n determinant is (2*0 -1*1)= -1. Cofactor is (-1)^(2+1)*(-1)= (-1)^3*(-1)=1.\n\nElement (2,2): minor for row2, column2: remove row2, column2:\n\nrows1 and3, columns1 and3:\n\n[0,1\n\n0,0] determinant is0*0 -1*0=0. Cofactor is (-1)^(2+2)*0=0.\n\nElement (2,3): minor for row2, column3: remove row2, column3:\n\nrows1 and3, columns1 and2:\n\n[0,2\n\n0,1] determinant is0*1 -2*0=0. Cofactor is (-1)^(2+3)*0=0.\n\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nRow3:\n\nElement (3,1): minor for row3, column1: remove row3, column1:\n\nrows1 and2, columns2 and3:\n\n[0,2,1\n\n1,1,1] \u2192 columns2,3:\n\nrows1: [2,1]\n\nrows2: [1,1] determinant is 2*1 -1*1=1. Cofactor is (-1)^(3+1)*1=1.\n\nElement (3,2): minor for row3, column2: remove row3, column2:\n\nrows1 and2, columns1 and3:\n\n[0,1\n\n1,1] determinant is0*1 -1*1= -1. Cofactor is (-1)^(3+2)*(-1)= (-1)^5*(-1)=1.\n\nElement (3,3): minor for row3, column3: remove row3, column3:\n\nrows1 and2, columns1 and2:\n\n[0,2\n\n1,1] determinant is0*1 -2*1= -2. Cofactor is (-1)^(3+3)*(-2)= -2.\n\nSo 3rd row cofactors: [1,1,-2]\n\nTherefore, the cofactor matrix is:\n\n[-1, 0, 1\n\n1, 0, 0\n\n1,1,-2]\n\nThe adjugate matrix is the transpose of this:\n\n[-1,1,1\n\n0,0,1\n\n1,0,-2]\n\nSo T^{-1} is:\n\n[\n[-1, 1, 1],\n[0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, -2]\n]\n\nNow, compute C_ocf = C * T^{-T}\n\nFirst, T^{-T} is the transpose of T^{-1}, which is:\n\n[\n[-1, 0, 1],\n[1,0,0],\n[1,1,-2]\n]\n\nBecause the transpose of T^{-1} is switching rows and columns:\n\nOriginal T^{-1}:\n\nRow1: -1,1,1\n\nRow2:0,0,1\n\nRow3:1,0,-2\n\nTranspose:\n\nColumn1: -1,0,1\n\nColumn2:1,0,0\n\nColumn3:1,1,-2\n\nSo T^{-T} is:\n\n[\n[-1, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, 0],\n[1, 1, -2]\n]\n\nNow, multiply the original C matrix by T^{-T} to get C_ocf.\n\nOriginal C is:\n\n[\n[0,1,0],\n[1,1,0]\n]\n\nSo compute C * T^{-T}:\n\nFirst row of C: [0,1,0]\n\nMultiply by T^{-T}:\n\n0*(-1) +1*(1) +0*(1) =1 \u2192 first element\n\n0*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0 \u2192 second element\n\n0*1 +1*0 +0*(-2) =0 \u2192 third element\n\nSo first row of C_ocf is [1,0,0]\n\nSecond row of C: [1,1,0]\n\nMultiply by T^{-T}:\n\n1*(-1) +1*1 +0*1 = (-1 +1 +0) =0\n\n1*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0\n\n1*1 +1*0 +0*(-2) =1\n\nSo second row of C_ocf is [0,0,1]\n\nTherefore, C_ocf is:\n\n[\n[1,0,0],\n[0,0,1]\n]\n\nBut wait, let me verify the multiplications again to be sure.\n\nFirst row of C is [0,1,0]. Multiply by T^{-T}:\n\nRow vector times columns of T^{-T}:\n\nFirst column of T^{-T} is [-1,0,1]. So 0*(-1) +1*0 +0*1= 0+0+0=0? Wait, no. Wait, when multiplying C (which 2x3) with T^{-T} (3x3), the result is 2x3 matrix. Wait, no. Wait, C is 2x3, T^{-T} is 3x3. So C * T^{-T} will be 2x3 matrix. But according to the previous calculation:\n\nFirst row of C (original) is [0,1,0]:\n\nMultiply each element by corresponding row of T^{-T} and sum.\n\nWait, matrix multiplication: each entry (i,j) is the dot product of row i of C and column j of T^{-T}.\n\nWait, T^{-T} 3x3 matrix:\n\nColumns are:\n\nColumn 1: [-1,0,1]\n\nColumn 2: [1,0,0]\n\nColumn 3: [1,1,-2]\n\nSo for the first row of C_ocf (from first row of C):\n\nEntry (1,1): [0,1,0] \u2022 [-1,0,1] = 0*(-1) +1*0 +0*1 =0\n\nWait, wait, this contradicts my previous result. What's wrong here.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's correct this.\n\nOriginal C is 2x3:\n\nFirst row: [0,1,0]\n\nSecond row: [1,1,0]\n\nT^{-T} is 3x3:\n\n[\n[-1,1,1],\n[0,0,1],\n[1,0,-2]\n]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the transpose of T^{-1} is T^{-T}, and T^{-1} is:\n\n[\n[-1, 1, 1],\n[0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, -2]\n]\n\nTherefore, T^{-T} (transpose of T^{-1}) is:\n\nRow1 of T^{-1} is [-1,1,1] becomes column1 of T^{-T}: [-1,1,1]\n\nRow2 of T^{-1} is [0,0,1] becomes column2: [0,0,1]\n\nRow3 of T^{-1} is [1,0,-2] becomes column3: [1,0,-2]\n\nSo T^{-T} is:\n\n[\n[-1,0,1],\n[1,0,0],\n[1,1,-2]\n]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the columns of T^{-T} are the rows of T^{-1}.\n\nRow1 of T^{-1}: [-1,1,1] \u2192 column1 of T^{-T}: [-1,1,1]\n\nRow2 of T^{-1}: [0,0,1] \u2192 column2 of T^{-T}: [0,0,1]\n\nRow3 of T^{-1}: [1,0,-2] \u2192 column3 of T^{-T}: [1,0,-2]\n\nTherefore, T^{-T} is:\n\n[\n[-1, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, 0],\n[1, 1, -2]\n]\n\nYes, so T^{-T} is:\n\nFirst column: [-1,1,1]\n\nSecond column: [0,0,1]\n\nThird column: [1,0,-2]\n\nNow, compute C * T^{-T}:\n\nFirst row of C is [0,1,0]\n\nMultiply by T^{-T} columns:\n\nEntry (1,1): 0*(-1) +1*1 +0*1 = 0 +1 +0=1\n\nEntry (1,2):0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0\n\nEntry (1,3):0*1 +1*0 +0*(-2)=0\n\nSo first row is [1,0,0].\n\nSecond row of C is [1,1,0]\n\nMultiply by columns:\n\nEntry (2,1):1*(-1) +1*1 +0*1 =-1 +1 +0=0\n\nEntry (2,2):1*0 +1*0 +0*1=0\n\nEntry (2,3):1*1 +1*0 +0*(-2)=1 +0 +0=1\n\nSo second row is [0,0,1].\n\nTherefore, C_ocf = [[1,0,0], [0,0,1]]\n\nBut wait, the observer canonical form for a multi-output system should have a specific structure where each output corresponds to an observable subsystem. For instance, with observability indices \u03bc1=2 and \u03bc2=1, the first output would have a 2-dimensional subsystem with C1 = [1 0 0], but the second output would have C2 = [0 0 1]. That seems to align with the result we have here. The new C matrix in observer canonical form is:\n\n[\n[1,0,0],\n[0,0,1]\n]\n\nThus, the answer should be C = [1 0 0; 0 0 1]\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To reduce the system to observer canonical form using duality, we first verify observability by checking the rank of the observability matrix, which is full (3). The dual system (A^T, C^T) is controllable. We transform the dual system into controller canonical form by constructing a transformation matrix T from the controllability matrix columns.

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to find the new matrix C after reducing the given system to observer canonical form using duality. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the observer canonical form is. I remember that there's a duality between controllable and observable forms. So, if a system is observable, its dual is controllable, and vice versa. The idea is to use that duality to transform the original system into observer canonical form by first converting the dual system into controller canonical form and then taking the transpose or something like that.\n\nThe given system is x(k+1) = A x(k) and y(k) = C x(k). The matrices are A = [[1,1,0], [2,1,1], [0,2,0]] and C = [[0,1,0], [1,1,0]]. The problem asks for the new C matrix after transformation. Wait, in the observer canonical form, the output matrix usually has a specific structure, like the first block being identity and the rest zero, but that might depend on the observability indices. \n\nSince we have two outputs (C has two rows), the system might split into two observable subsystems. But maybe I should approach this through duality. The dual system of (A, C) is (A', C', B') where B would be C^T in this case. Wait, duality swaps the roles of B and C, and transposes the matrices. So the dual system is (A_transpose, B_transpose, C_transpose) where original system is (A, B, C). Wait, in the original system here, B isn't given because it's a system without a control input, just the autonomous system. But maybe the approach is to consider the dual system for observability. \n\nWait, the standard approach for reducing to observer canonical form using duality is to:\n\n1. Find the dual system by taking (A_transpose, C_transpose, B_transpose, D_transpose). Since our original system doesn't have a B (uncontrolled), maybe D is not present. But perhaps for the purpose of duality, since the original system is x(k+1) = A x(k), y = C x(k), the dual system would be z(k+1) = A^T z(k) + C^T u(k), and the output is something else. Wait, maybe the duality here is between controllability and observability. So if the original system is observable, then the dual is controllable. So if we can transform the dual system into controller canonical form, then the original system transformed into observer canonical form would be the dual of that.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Compute the observability matrix of the original system. If it's observable, then the dual system is controllable. Then, transform the dual system into controller canonical form, then the observer canonical form of the original system is the dual of that transformation.\n\nBut perhaps another way is to compute the transformation matrix for the dual system to controller form and then apply the transpose or inverse transpose to the original system.\n\nAlternatively, the observer canonical form can be obtained by first converting the dual system to controller canonical form and then transposing back. So here's the process:\n\n1. Find the dual system: A_d = A^T, B_d = C^T, C_d = B^T (but since the original system has no B, maybe the dual system's C_d is not needed here. Wait, maybe the approach is that since the original system is (A, C), the dual is (A^T, C^T, ...). But perhaps for the purpose of using controllability to get the controller form for the dual system, then converting back.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps properly.\n\nFirst, the original system is (A, C). To use duality for observer canonical form, we can:\n\n1. Consider the dual system (A^T, C^T, something). The controllability of the dual system is equivalent to the observability of the original system. So, first check if the original system is observable. If it is, then the dual system is controllable, and we can transform it into controller canonical form.\n\n2. Once the dual system is in controller canonical form, the original system in observer canonical form is obtained by transposing the matrices appropriately.\n\nBut how exactly does this work? Let me think. Suppose we have the dual system (A', B', C') where A' = A^T and B' = C^T. Then, if we transform this dual system into controller canonical form using a transformation matrix T, then the observer canonical form of the original system would be T^{-T} A T^T and so on? Wait, maybe not. Let's recall that for a system (A, B, C), the dual is (A^T, C^T, B^T). So the original system's output matrix C becomes the dual's input matrix B_d = C^T. So, in the dual system, the input matrix is B_d = C^T. \n\nNow, if the dual system is controllable (i.e., original system is observable), then we can transform it into controller canonical form. Let's call the transformation matrix for the dual system T. The controller canonical form for the dual system would have A'_ccf = T^{-1} A^T T and B'_ccf = T^{-1} C^T.\n\nThen, the observer canonical form of the original system would be the dual of this controller canonical form. So, the observer form's A matrix would be (A'_ccf)^T = T^T A (T^{-1})^T, and the C matrix would be (B'_ccf)^T = C T^{-T} (since B'_ccf is T^{-1} C^T, so its transpose is C T^{-T} ). Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the observer canonical form for the original system (A, C) can be obtained by first converting the dual system (A^T, C^T) into controller canonical form, then taking the transpose. Let me check this.\n\nSuppose the dual system is (A^T, C^T). The controller canonical form (CCF) of the dual system is achieved via a transformation matrix T such that A_ccf = T^{-1} A^T T and B_ccf = T^{-1} C^T. The observer canonical form (OCF) of the original system would then have matrices A_ocf = A_ccf^T = T^T A (T^{-1})^T and C_ocf = B_ccf^T = (T^{-1} C^T)^T = C T^{-T}.\n\nBut maybe more straightforwardly, the observer canonical form's C matrix will be in a specific form, perhaps with ones and zeros depending on the observability indices. However, since the original C matrix has two rows, the system is a multi-output system, so the observer canonical form might be in a block diagonal form based on the observability indices.\n\nAlternatively, the observer canonical form for multi-output systems can be more complex, but maybe here, since we are using duality, we can proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the observability matrix of the original system. If it's full rank, then the system is observable, and we can proceed. Then, since the dual system is controllable, transform it to controller canonical form, and then transpose back.\n\nWait, perhaps the main steps are:\n\n1. Check observability of the original system by computing the observability matrix. If it's rank n (3), then it's observable. Let's do that first.\n\nOriginal system has C = [[0,1,0], [1,1,0]]. The observability matrix O is constructed as [C; C A; C A^2]. Let's compute O.\n\nFirst, compute C:\n\nC1 = [0,1,0]\nC2 = [1,1,0]\n\nCompute C*A:\n\nC1*A = [0,1,0] * [[1,1,0], [2,1,1], [0,2,0]] = [2,1,1]\n\nC2*A = [1,1,0] * A = [1*1 +1*2 +0*0, 1*1 +1*1 +0*2, 1*0 +1*1 +0*0] = [1+2, 1+1, 1] = [3, 2, 1]\n\nWait, matrix multiplication is row by column. Let me compute each entry properly.\n\nFor C1 (row vector) multiplied by A:\n\nFirst element: 0*1 + 1*2 + 0*0 = 2\nSecond element: 0*1 +1*1 +0*2 =1\nThird element:0*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1\nSo C1*A is [2,1,1]\n\nSimilarly, C2 (row vector) times A:\n\nFirst element:1*1 +1*2 +0*0 = 1 +2 =3\nSecond element:1*1 +1*1 +0*2 =1 +1 =2\nThird element:1*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1\nSo C2*A is [3,2,1]\n\nNow, next layer: C*A^2. Compute A^2 first.\n\nA is:\nRow 1: 1,1,0\nRow 2:2,1,1\nRow3:0,2,0\n\nCompute A^2 = A*A:\n\nRow 1 of A multiplied by columns of A:\n\nFirst element:1*1 +1*2 +0*0 = 1 +2 =3\nSecond element:1*1 +1*1 +0*2 =1 +1=2\nThird element:1*0 +1*1 +0*0 =1\n\nRow 2:\n\n2*1 +1*2 +1*0 =2+2=4\n2*1 +1*1 +1*2 =2+1+2=5\n2*0 +1*1 +1*0=1\n\nRow3:\n\n0*1 +2*2 +0*0=4\n0*1 +2*1 +0*2=2\n0*0 +2*1 +0*0=2\n\nSo A^2 is:\n\n[[3, 2, 1],\n [4,5,1],\n [4,2,2]]\n\nNow compute C1*A^2 and C2*A^2.\n\nC1*A^2: [0,1,0] * A^2 = [4,5,1] (since it's the second row of A^2)\n\nC2*A^2: [1,1,0] * A^2. Let's compute element-wise:\n\nFirst element:1*3 +1*4 +0*4 =3+4=7\nSecond element:1*2 +1*5 +0*2 =2+5=7\nThird element:1*1 +1*1 +0*2 =1+1=2\n\nSo C2*A^2 is [7,7,2]\n\nNow, the observability matrix O is:\n\nC1       [0,1,0]\nC2       [1,1,0]\nC1*A     [2,1,1]\nC2*A     [3,2,1]\nC1*A^2  [4,5,1]\nC2*A^2  [7,7,2]\n\nSo O is a 6x3 matrix. Let's check its rank. We can write it out:\n\nRow1: 0 1 0\nRow2:1 1 0\nRow3:2 1 1\nRow4:3 2 1\nRow5:4 5 1\nRow6:7 7 2\n\nTo compute the rank, we can see if any 3 rows are linearly independent. Let's check the first three rows:\n\nRows 1,2,3:\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n2 1 1\n\nThe determinant of the matrix formed by these three rows is:\n\n| 0 1 0 |\n\n|1 1 0 | \n\n|2 1 1 |\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\n= 0*(1*1 - 0*1) -1*(1*1 -0*2) +0*(1*1 -1*2)\n\n= 0 -1*(1 -0) +0 = -1. So determinant is -1 \u2260 0. Therefore, the first three rows are linearly independent, so the observability matrix has rank at least 3. Since the state is 3-dimensional, the system is observable. Therefore, the dual system is controllable, which allows us to proceed.\n\nNow, the dual system is (A^T, C^T). The dual system's A matrix is A^T, and B matrix is C^T. Wait, since the original system is x(k+1) = A x(k), y = C x(k). The dual system (for controllability) would be z(k+1) = A^T z(k) + C^T u(k). So the dual system has input matrix B_d = C^T. Therefore, to transform the dual system into controller canonical form, we need to find a transformation matrix T such that T^{-1} A^T T is in controller form and T^{-1} C^T has the structure [0; ...; 1].\n\nBut since the original C has two rows, the dual system has two inputs (since B_d = C^T is a 3x2 matrix). Wait, no. Wait, in the original system, C is 2x3, so C^T is 3x2. Therefore, the dual system has two inputs, each being a 3-dimensional vector. So the dual system is a multi-input system. Converting a multi-input system to controller canonical form is more involved. In contrast to the single-input case where the controller form is unique, for multi-input systems, the form can vary based on controllability indices. However, since the original system has two outputs, the dual system has two inputs. So the controllability indices for the dual system would need to sum to n=3. The possible controllability indices could be (2,1) or other combinations. But this might complicate things. However, since in the problem statement we are to use duality to get the observer canonical form, perhaps we can use the fact that for each output, we can create a subsystem in observer form. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the system can be transformed into a single observer canonical form despite multiple outputs. But I'm not sure. Let me try to recall.\n\nAlternatively, the observer canonical form for multiple outputs can be constructed by considering the observability indices. The observability indices are determined by the number of linearly independent rows contributed by each output in the observability matrix. Let's see. The original C matrix has two rows. In the observability matrix O, the first block is C, then C A, etc. Let's check how the rows of O are built:\n\nFrom the original O matrix, the rows contributed by C1 and C2 are:\n\nRows 1 (C1), 2 (C2), 3 (C1 A), 4 (C2 A), 5 (C1 A\u00b2), 6 (C2 A\u00b2). The rank is 3, so the observability indices are determined by how these rows contribute to the rank. Let's see which rows are linearly independent. For example, the first two rows (C1 and C2) are [0,1,0] and [1,1,0]. Let's see if they are linearly independent. The determinant of the matrix formed by rows 1 and 2 would be the determinant of a 2x3 matrix, which isn't square, but their rank is 2. So they contribute 2 to the rank, and adding C1 A (row3: [2,1,1]) gives the third linearly independent row. So the observability indices could be \u03bc1=2 and \u03bc2=1, because C1 contributes two rows (row1 and row3 and row5?), but maybe another way. Wait, the standard method for determining observability indices is the following: Start with the first output, add rows from the observability matrix until the rank increases. Then proceed with the next output.\n\nAlternatively, given the observability matrix O, the procedure is:\n\nInitialize: k=1, current rank r=0.\n\nFor each output i=1 to p (here p=2):\n\nFor j=0,1,..., compute the rank when adding C_i A^j. Let me try to compute.\n\nStart with O_0 = empty matrix. Then:\n\nAdd rows from C1 and C2.\n\nFirst, add C1 (row1): rank 1.\n\nAdd C2 (row2): rank becomes 2.\n\nThen add C1 A (row3): rank becomes 3. So the first output (C1) contributes two rows (row1 and row3), and the second output (C2) contributes one row (row2). Therefore, the observability indices are \u03bc1=2 and \u03bc2=1. Their sum is 3, which is the system's order. Hence, this makes sense. Therefore, the observer canonical form would have two blocks, one of size 2x2 and another 1x1. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, when using duality, since the dual system has two inputs, we need to transform it into controller canonical form with controllability indices (2,1). However, transforming a multi-input system into controller form is more complex. But since the problem states to use duality, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe dual system is (A^T, B_d = C^T), with A^T being:\n\nOriginal A:\n\n1 1 0\n\n2 1 1\n\n0 2 0\n\nSo A^T is:\n\n1 2 0\n\n1 1 2\n\n0 1 0\n\nAnd B_d = C^T, which is:\n\nC is two rows: [0,1,0] and [1,1,0], so C^T is:\n\nFirst column: 0,1,0\n\nSecond column:1,1,0\n\nSo B_d is:\n\n[0 1\n\n1 1\n\n0 0]\n\nSo the dual system is:\n\nz(k+1) = A^T z(k) + B_d u(k)\n\nNow, to convert this dual system into controller canonical form. But since it's a multi-input system (two inputs), we need to use the controllability indices. The controllability indices for the dual system would be the observability indices of the original system, which we determined as \u03bc1=2 and \u03bc2=1. Therefore, the controllability indices for the dual system are the same, \u03c11=2 and \u03c12=1. Wait, but controllability indices for a system with m inputs are m integers that sum to n. Here, m=2, n=3, so \u03c11 + \u03c12 = 3. The possible indices are 2 and 1. So the controller canonical form for the dual system would be in a block form where the first block is 2x2 and the second is 1x1. The transformation matrix for the dual system can be constructed using the controllability matrix.\n\nThe controllability matrix for the dual system is:\n\nK_d = [B_d, A^T B_d, (A^T)^2 B_d]\n\nCompute K_d:\n\nFirst, compute A^T B_d:\n\nA^T is:\n\n[1 2 0\n\n1 1 2\n\n0 1 0]\n\nMultiply by B_d:\n\nB_d columns are [0,1,0] and [1,1,0].\n\nCompute first column of A^T B_d:\n\nA^T * [0;1;0] = [1*0 +2*1 +0*0, ...] = 2 (first entry), 1*0 +1*1 +2*0 =1, 0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1. So [2,1,1]^T.\n\nSecond column: A^T * [1;1;0] = [1*1 +2*1 +0*0 =3; 1*1 +1*1 +2*0=2; 0*1 +1*1 +0*0=1]. So [3,2,1]^T.\n\nThus, A^T B_d = [[2,3],[1,2],[1,1]]\n\nSimilarly, compute (A^T)^2:\n\nA^T squared is A^T * A^T:\n\nRow 1 of A^T: [1,2,0]. Multiply by A^T columns:\n\nFirst element:1*1 +2*1 +0*0 =3\n\nSecond element:1*2 +2*1 +0*1 =2 +2=4\n\nThird element:1*0 +2*2 +0*0=4\n\nRow 2 of A^T: [1,1,2]. Multiply by A^T columns:\n\nFirst column:1*1 +1*1 +2*0=2\n\nSecond column:1*2 +1*1 +2*1=2 +1 +2=5\n\nThird column:1*0 +1*2 +2*0=2\n\nRow 3 of A^T: [0,1,0]. Multiply by A^T columns:\n\nFirst column:0*1 +1*1 +0*0=1\n\nSecond column:0*2 +1*1 +0*1=1\n\nThird column:0*0 +1*2 +0*0=2\n\nSo (A^T)^2 is:\n\n[3,4,4\n\n2,5,2\n\n1,1,2]\n\nNow compute (A^T)^2 B_d:\n\nMultiply (A^T)^2 with B_d:\n\nFirst column of B_d is [0;1;0], second is [1;1;0].\n\nCompute (A^T)^2 * [0;1;0]:\n\nRow1:3*0 +4*1 +4*0=4\n\nRow2:2*0 +5*1 +2*0=5\n\nRow3:1*0 +1*1 +2*0=1\n\nSo first column is [4;5;1]\n\nSecond column: (A^T)^2 * [1;1;0]:\n\nRow1:3*1 +4*1 +4*0=7\n\nRow2:2*1 +5*1 +2*0=7\n\nRow3:1*1 +1*1 +2*0=2\n\nSo second column is [7;7;2]\n\nThus, (A^T)^2 B_d is [[4,7],[5,7],[1,2]]\n\nTherefore, the controllability matrix K_d for the dual system is:\n\nColumns from B_d: [0,1,0] and [1,1,0]\n\nThen A^T B_d columns: [2,1,1] and [3,2,1]\n\nThen (A^T)^2 B_d columns: [4,5,1] and [7,7,2]\n\nSo K_d is the concatenation:\n\n[0,1,2,3,4,7\n\n1,1,1,2,5,7\n\n0,0,1,1,1,2]\n\nWait, but the controllability matrix for the dual system is [B_d, A^T B_d, (A^T)^2 B_d], which has 3*2=6 columns. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, B_d is 3x2, so K_d is 3x6 matrix:\n\nColumns:\n\n1: 0,1,0 (first column of B_d)\n\n2:1,1,0 (second column of B_d)\n\n3:2,1,1 (first column of A^T B_d)\n\n4:3,2,1 (second column of A^T B_d)\n\n5:4,5,1 (first column of (A^T)^2 B_d)\n\n6:7,7,2 (second column of (A^T)^2 B_d)\n\nNow, we need to pick a basis from K_d. Since the dual system is controllable (original system is observable), the controllability matrix has rank 3. To form the transformation matrix T, we need to select linearly independent columns from K_d. Let's select the first three columns that are linearly independent.\n\nCheck the rank of the first three columns:\n\nColumns 1, 2, 3:\n\n0 1 2\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 0 1\n\nThe determinant of this 3x3 matrix is:\n\n0*(1*1 - 1*0) - 1*(1*1 -1*0) + 2*(1*0 -1*0) = 0 -1*(1) + 2*0 = -1 \u2260 0. Therefore, columns 1,2,3 are linearly independent. So we can take columns 1,2,3 from K_d as the basis. Wait, but in controllability matrix for multi-input systems, the standard approach is to pick columns sequentially until we get n linearly independent columns. For a system with m inputs, the method is to take the first m columns, then the next m, etc., until rank is achieved. But here, m=2, n=3. So we need to pick two columns from B_d, then one more from A^T B_d to get rank 3. Let me see:\n\nColumns 1,2 (from B_d): matrix:\n\n0 1\n\n1 1\n\n0 0\n\nRank 2? Determinant of the first two rows: determinant is 0*1 -1*1 = -1 \u22600, so yes, rank 2.\n\nThen, adding column3 (first column of A^T B_d), which is [2,1,1]^T. Let's check if the three vectors are independent. As before, columns 1,2,3 form a matrix with determinant -1, so they are linearly independent. Therefore, the transformation matrix T can be formed by these three columns. But in controller canonical form for multi-input systems, we need to arrange the transformation matrix according to the controllability indices. However, this might get complicated, but let me try. \n\nThe transformation matrix T is built as follows for the controller form with controllability indices \u03c11=2 and \u03c12=1. The procedure is to take the first \u03c11 columns from the controllability matrix for the first input, and the first \u03c12 columns for the second input. Wait, since controllability indices are \u03c11=2 and \u03c12=1, this means that the first input channel requires 2 steps to span the space, and the second input requires 1. \n\nSo for input 1 (first column of B_d), we take B_d1, A^T B_d1, ..., A^T^{\u03c11-1} B_d1. Similarly for input 2: B_d2, A^T B_d2, ... A^T^{\u03c12-1} B_d2. So with \u03c11=2 and \u03c12=1, the columns of T should be [B_d1, A^T B_d1, B_d2].\n\nLet's verify:\n\nB_d1 is the first column of B_d: [0;1;0]\n\nA^T B_d1 is [2;1;1] (from earlier calculation)\n\nB_d2 is the second column of B_d: [1;1;0]\n\nSo T = [B_d1, A^T B_d1, B_d2] = columns:\n\n0,2,1\n\n1,1,1\n\n0,1,0\n\nCompute the determinant of T:\n\n|0 2 1|\n\n|1 1 1|\n\n|0 1 0|\n\nThe determinant is 0*(1*0 -1*1) -2*(1*0 -1*0) +1*(1*1 -1*0) = 0 -0 +1*(1) =1 \u22600. So T is invertible.\n\nThus, the transformation matrix T is:\n\n[0 2 1\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0]\n\nNow, the controller canonical form for the dual system is given by:\n\nA_ccf = T^{-1} A^T T\n\nB_ccf = T^{-1} B_d\n\nBut since we need the observer canonical form of the original system, which is the dual of the controller form of the dual system. The observer canonical form matrices would be:\n\nA_ocf = A_ccf^T\n\nC_ocf = B_ccf^T\n\nBut I need to verify. Let's think:\n\nThe dual of the controller canonical form (which is in the dual system) gives the observer canonical form of the original system. Therefore, if the dual system in controller form has (A_ccf, B_ccf), then the observer form of the original system is (A_ccf^T, C_ocf = B_ccf^T, ...). Since the original system's output matrix C becomes the dual's input matrix B_d = C^T, the dual system's B_ccf is T^{-1} B_d. Then, the observer canonical form's C matrix is B_ccf^T.\n\nWait, let's define:\n\nThe observer canonical form for the original system is obtained by taking the dual of the controller canonical form of the dual system. So:\n\nOriginal system's observer form:\n\nA_ocf = (T^{-1} A^T T)^T = T^T A (T^{-1})^T\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the C matrix directly. Since in the dual system's controller form, B_ccf = T^{-1} B_d. Then, in the observer form, the C matrix is B_ccf^T. Because in the dual system, the input matrix is B_d = C^T, and after transformation, B_ccf = T^{-1} C^T. Then, the C matrix for the observer form would be (B_ccf)^T = (T^{-1} C^T)^T = C T^{-T}. But since the original C is part of the observer form's C matrix, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the observer canonical form of the original system (A, C) is given by the matrices:\n\nA_ocf = T_obs^{-1} A T_obs\n\nC_ocf = C T_obs\n\nBut how does this relate to the dual system's controller form? Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to make it step by step.\n\nThe standard duality relationship is that the observer canonical form of a system is the dual of the controller canonical form of its dual system. So, if you take the dual system (A^T, C^T), convert it to controller form (A_ccf, B_ccf), then the observer form of the original system is (A_ccf^T, C_ocf = B_ccf^T). So in this case, C_ocf would be B_ccf^T.\n\nGiven that, since in the dual system's controller form, B_ccf = T^{-1} C^T, then C_ocf = (T^{-1} C^T)^T = C T^{-T}.\n\nSo, to find C_ocf, we need to compute C multiplied by T^{-T}.\n\nBut T is the transformation matrix for the dual system, which is [B_d1, A^T B_d1, B_d2] as before.\n\nGiven T:\n\nT = [\n[0, 2, 1],\n[1, 1, 1],\n[0, 1, 0]\n]\n\nFirst, compute T inverse. Let's compute T^{-1}.\n\nGiven T:\n\nRow1:0,2,1\n\nRow2:1,1,1\n\nRow3:0,1,0\n\nWe need to compute the inverse of this matrix. Let me denote T as:\n\n0 2 1\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0\n\nThe determinant of T is 1, as computed earlier.\n\nTo compute T^{-1}, let's use the adjugate matrix.\n\nCompute minors:\n\nFor element (1,1): determinant of submatrix excluding row1, column1:\n\n|1 1|\n\n|1 0| = (1*0 -1*1) = -1. Multiply by (-1)^(1+1)=1 \u2192 -1\n\nElement (1,2): minor for row1, column2 is determinant of:\n\n|1 1|\n\n|0 0| = 0. Multiply by (-1)^(1+2) \u2192 0.\n\nElement (1,3): minor for row1, column3:\n\n|1 1|\n\n|0 1| =1*1 -1*0=1 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(1+3)=1 \u2192 1\n\nSimilarly for other elements:\n\nRow2:\n\nElement (2,1): minor for row2, column1:\n\n|2 1|\n\n|1 0| = (2*0 -1*1) = -1 \u2192 (-1)^(2+1) * (-1) = (-1)^3 * (-1) = 1\n\nElement (2,2): minor for row2, column2:\n\n|0 1|\n\n|0 0| =0 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(2+2)=1 \u2192 0\n\nElement (2,3): minor for row2, column3:\n\n|0 2|\n\n|0 1| =0*1 -2*0=0 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(2+3)= -1 \u2192 0\n\nRow3:\n\nElement (3,1): minor for row3, column1:\n\n|2 1|\n\n|1 1| =2*1 -1*1=1 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(3+1)=1 \u21921\n\nElement (3,2): minor for row3, column2:\n\n|0 1|\n\n|1 1| =0*1 -1*1=-1 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(3+2)= -1 \u2192 1\n\nElement (3,3): minor for row3, column3:\n\n|0 2|\n\n|1 1| =0*1 -2*1 =-2 \u2192 multiply by (-1)^(3+3)=1 \u2192 -2\n\nTherefore, the matrix of minors with signs is:\n\nRow1: -1, 0, 1\n\nRow2:1, 0, 0\n\nRow3:1,1,-2\n\nTranspose this matrix to get the adjugate:\n\nOriginal minors matrix:\n\n[-1, 0, 1\n\n1, 0, 0\n\n1,1,-2]\n\nTranspose:\n\n[-1,1,1\n\n0,0,1\n\n1,0,-2]\n\nSo T^{-1} is adjugate divided by determinant (which is 1), so:\n\nT^{-1} = [\n[-1, 1, 1],\n[0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, -2]\n]\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the minors and the adjugate.\n\nWait, the adjugate matrix is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors (minors with signs). Let me verify the minors again.\n\nWait, for element (1,1): the minor is determinant of rows 2-3 and columns 2-3. But wait, the matrix T is 3x3, so removing row1 and column1 gives:\n\nrows 2,3 and columns 2,3:\n\n[1,1\n\n1,0] determinant is (1*0 -1*1) = -1. The cofactor is (-1)^(1+1) * (-1) = -1. So the cofactor for (1,1) is -1.\n\nElement (1,2): minor is determinant of rows 2,3 and columns 1,3 (since column2 is removed):\n\n[1,1\n\n0,0] determinant is 0, cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) *0 =0.\n\nElement (1,3): minor is determinant of rows 2,3 and columns 1,2:\n\n[1,1\n\n0,1] determinant is1*1 -1*0=1. Cofactor is (-1)^(1+3)*1=1.\n\nRow1: [-1, 0, 1]\n\nRow2:\n\nElement (2,1): minor for row2, column1: remove row2 and column1, so rows1,3 and columns2,3:\n\n[0,2,1\n\n0,1,0] \u2192 removing column1, then rows1 and3:\n\nrows1: [2,1]\n\nrow3: [1,0]\n\n determinant is (2*0 -1*1)= -1. Cofactor is (-1)^(2+1)*(-1)= (-1)^3*(-1)=1.\n\nElement (2,2): minor for row2, column2: remove row2, column2:\n\nrows1 and3, columns1 and3:\n\n[0,1\n\n0,0] determinant is0*0 -1*0=0. Cofactor is (-1)^(2+2)*0=0.\n\nElement (2,3): minor for row2, column3: remove row2, column3:\n\nrows1 and3, columns1 and2:\n\n[0,2\n\n0,1] determinant is0*1 -2*0=0. Cofactor is (-1)^(2+3)*0=0.\n\nRow2: [1,0,0]\n\nRow3:\n\nElement (3,1): minor for row3, column1: remove row3, column1:\n\nrows1 and2, columns2 and3:\n\n[0,2,1\n\n1,1,1] \u2192 columns2,3:\n\nrows1: [2,1]\n\nrows2: [1,1] determinant is 2*1 -1*1=1. Cofactor is (-1)^(3+1)*1=1.\n\nElement (3,2): minor for row3, column2: remove row3, column2:\n\nrows1 and2, columns1 and3:\n\n[0,1\n\n1,1] determinant is0*1 -1*1= -1. Cofactor is (-1)^(3+2)*(-1)= (-1)^5*(-1)=1.\n\nElement (3,3): minor for row3, column3: remove row3, column3:\n\nrows1 and2, columns1 and2:\n\n[0,2\n\n1,1] determinant is0*1 -2*1= -2. Cofactor is (-1)^(3+3)*(-2)= -2.\n\nSo 3rd row cofactors: [1,1,-2]\n\nTherefore, the cofactor matrix is:\n\n[-1, 0, 1\n\n1, 0, 0\n\n1,1,-2]\n\nThe adjugate matrix is the transpose of this:\n\n[-1,1,1\n\n0,0,1\n\n1,0,-2]\n\nSo T^{-1} is:\n\n[\n[-1, 1, 1],\n[0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, -2]\n]\n\nNow, compute C_ocf = C * T^{-T}\n\nFirst, T^{-T} is the transpose of T^{-1}, which is:\n\n[\n[-1, 0, 1],\n[1,0,0],\n[1,1,-2]\n]\n\nBecause the transpose of T^{-1} is switching rows and columns:\n\nOriginal T^{-1}:\n\nRow1: -1,1,1\n\nRow2:0,0,1\n\nRow3:1,0,-2\n\nTranspose:\n\nColumn1: -1,0,1\n\nColumn2:1,0,0\n\nColumn3:1,1,-2\n\nSo T^{-T} is:\n\n[\n[-1, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, 0],\n[1, 1, -2]\n]\n\nNow, multiply the original C matrix by T^{-T} to get C_ocf.\n\nOriginal C is:\n\n[\n[0,1,0],\n[1,1,0]\n]\n\nSo compute C * T^{-T}:\n\nFirst row of C: [0,1,0]\n\nMultiply by T^{-T}:\n\n0*(-1) +1*(1) +0*(1) =1 \u2192 first element\n\n0*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0 \u2192 second element\n\n0*1 +1*0 +0*(-2) =0 \u2192 third element\n\nSo first row of C_ocf is [1,0,0]\n\nSecond row of C: [1,1,0]\n\nMultiply by T^{-T}:\n\n1*(-1) +1*1 +0*1 = (-1 +1 +0) =0\n\n1*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0\n\n1*1 +1*0 +0*(-2) =1\n\nSo second row of C_ocf is [0,0,1]\n\nTherefore, C_ocf is:\n\n[\n[1,0,0],\n[0,0,1]\n]\n\nBut wait, let me verify the multiplications again to be sure.\n\nFirst row of C is [0,1,0]. Multiply by T^{-T}:\n\nRow vector times columns of T^{-T}:\n\nFirst column of T^{-T} is [-1,0,1]. So 0*(-1) +1*0 +0*1= 0+0+0=0? Wait, no. Wait, when multiplying C (which 2x3) with T^{-T} (3x3), the result is 2x3 matrix. Wait, no. Wait, C is 2x3, T^{-T} is 3x3. So C * T^{-T} will be 2x3 matrix. But according to the previous calculation:\n\nFirst row of C (original) is [0,1,0]:\n\nMultiply each element by corresponding row of T^{-T} and sum.\n\nWait, matrix multiplication: each entry (i,j) is the dot product of row i of C and column j of T^{-T}.\n\nWait, T^{-T} 3x3 matrix:\n\nColumns are:\n\nColumn 1: [-1,0,1]\n\nColumn 2: [1,0,0]\n\nColumn 3: [1,1,-2]\n\nSo for the first row of C_ocf (from first row of C):\n\nEntry (1,1): [0,1,0] \u2022 [-1,0,1] = 0*(-1) +1*0 +0*1 =0\n\nWait, wait, this contradicts my previous result. What's wrong here.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's correct this.\n\nOriginal C is 2x3:\n\nFirst row: [0,1,0]\n\nSecond row: [1,1,0]\n\nT^{-T} is 3x3:\n\n[\n[-1,1,1],\n[0,0,1],\n[1,0,-2]\n]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the transpose of T^{-1} is T^{-T}, and T^{-1} is:\n\n[\n[-1, 1, 1],\n[0, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, -2]\n]\n\nTherefore, T^{-T} (transpose of T^{-1}) is:\n\nRow1 of T^{-1} is [-1,1,1] becomes column1 of T^{-T}: [-1,1,1]\n\nRow2 of T^{-1} is [0,0,1] becomes column2: [0,0,1]\n\nRow3 of T^{-1} is [1,0,-2] becomes column3: [1,0,-2]\n\nSo T^{-T} is:\n\n[\n[-1,0,1],\n[1,0,0],\n[1,1,-2]\n]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the columns of T^{-T} are the rows of T^{-1}.\n\nRow1 of T^{-1}: [-1,1,1] \u2192 column1 of T^{-T}: [-1,1,1]\n\nRow2 of T^{-1}: [0,0,1] \u2192 column2 of T^{-T}: [0,0,1]\n\nRow3 of T^{-1}: [1,0,-2] \u2192 column3 of T^{-T}: [1,0,-2]\n\nTherefore, T^{-T} is:\n\n[\n[-1, 0, 1],\n[1, 0, 0],\n[1, 1, -2]\n]\n\nYes, so T^{-T} is:\n\nFirst column: [-1,1,1]\n\nSecond column: [0,0,1]\n\nThird column: [1,0,-2]\n\nNow, compute C * T^{-T}:\n\nFirst row of C is [0,1,0]\n\nMultiply by T^{-T} columns:\n\nEntry (1,1): 0*(-1) +1*1 +0*1 = 0 +1 +0=1\n\nEntry (1,2):0*0 +1*0 +0*1=0\n\nEntry (1,3):0*1 +1*0 +0*(-2)=0\n\nSo first row is [1,0,0].\n\nSecond row of C is [1,1,0]\n\nMultiply by columns:\n\nEntry (2,1):1*(-1) +1*1 +0*1 =-1 +1 +0=0\n\nEntry (2,2):1*0 +1*0 +0*1=0\n\nEntry (2,3):1*1 +1*0 +0*(-2)=1 +0 +0=1\n\nSo second row is [0,0,1].\n\nTherefore, C_ocf = [[1,0,0], [0,0,1]]\n\nBut wait, the observer canonical form for a multi-output system should have a specific structure where each output corresponds to an observable subsystem. For instance, with observability indices \u03bc1=2 and \u03bc2=1, the first output would have a 2-dimensional subsystem with C1 = [1 0 0], but the second output would have C2 = [0 0 1]. That seems to align with the result we have here. The new C matrix in observer canonical form is:\n\n[\n[1,0,0],\n[0,0,1]\n]\n\nThus, the answer should be C = [1 0 0; 0 0 1]",
