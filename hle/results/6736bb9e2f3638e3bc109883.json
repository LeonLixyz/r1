  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many US states allow involuntary servitude as of November 2024. Hmm, I remember that the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. So, that exception means that states can use involuntary labor from convicted individuals. But wait, some states have been working on removing that exception from their own constitutions.\n\nI think there was a movement in recent years where several states proposed amendments to eliminate the language allowing involuntary servitude as a punishment. For example, in 2022, five states\u2014Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Louisiana\u2014had ballot measures about this. Let me check: I recall that some of those states passed the amendments. Vermont actually had a similar provision in its constitution, and they were the first to ban slavery without exception, but maybe that's earlier. Wait, wasn't there a vote in 2022 where like five states addressed this? \n\nSo, as of November 2024, how many still allow it? If those states passed amendments to remove the exception, then the count would go down. But let's confirm. Before 2022, I think there were 20 states that had constitutions allowing involuntary servitude as punishment. Then in the 2022 elections, those five states had measures. Let me see: Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Louisiana. But I think some of those measures didn't pass. For example, Louisiana's amendment failed because the wording was confusing. So maybe after 2022, out of those five, four passed except Louisiana. So subtracting those four from the original 20 would make 16. But wait, maybe other states have done this since then. Wait, the question is as of November 2024. So from 2022 to 2024, maybe more states have passed such amendments. But I'm not sure. Let me think. After 2022, maybe other states followed suit. But I don't remember specific numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe by November 2024, the total number is 20 minus the ones that passed in 2022. Let me count: if Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont passed their amendments (assuming Louisiana didn't), then 20 -4=16. But I'm not sure if the original number was 20. Wait, maybe before 2022, there were 20 states that had constitutions with the exception clause. Then, after some passed amendments, the number decreased. But perhaps the exact number is 22 states remaining? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try another approach. \n\nThe 13th Amendment allows involuntary servitude as punishment. So states that have not explicitly banned it in their own constitutions would still allow it under that exception. As of 2023, I think around 20 states still had such language. But in 2022, five states considered amendments. Let's check each of those five. Alabama: Amendment 1 in 2022 was to remove all involuntary servitude. It passed. Oregon: Measure 112 passed, removing the exception. Tennessee: Amendment 3 was approved, removing the exception. Vermont: Article 1 was amended, but I think they already had a ban, but maybe they clarified it. Wait, Vermont's original constitution prohibited slavery for adults but allowed it for minors. The 2022 amendment removed that. So maybe Vermont is counted as changing. Louisiana's amendment failed. So four states (AL, OR, TN, VT) passed amendments. So if the original count was 20, subtract 4, giving 16. But if there were more states after 2022, up to 2024, maybe a couple more. However, I don't have data beyond 2022. So as of November 2024, assuming that between 2022 and 2024, no other states passed such amendments, the answer would be 20 -4=16. But wait, maybe the original number was higher. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that as of 2024, 16 states allow it. But I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct number is 20 states still allow it. Wait, no. Because the states that passed amendments would have removed the exception. So the count should go down. But I'm not 100% sure of the exact number. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 16. But I need to make sure. Let me check again: in 2022, five states had ballot measures. Four passed (AL, OR, TN, VT) and LA failed. So if previously there were 20, then 20 -4=16. If no other states changed by 2024, then 16. But maybe some states changed in 2023 or 2024. For example, in 2023, Colorado passed an amendment in 2018, so earlier. So maybe the count was 20 states before 2022, then minus 4, leading to 16. Therefore, the answer is 16. But I need to confirm. Some sources say that as of 2023, 19 states still have constitutions that permit slavery or involuntary servitude as criminal punishment. But wait, that might be after some amendments. Wait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, according to a 2022 article, before the 2022 elections, there were 20 states with such language. After the 2022 elections, four states removed it (since Louisiana's failed), so 16. But another source says that as of October 2023, there are 19 states. That doesn't add up. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the original number was higher. For example, in 2020, Colorado became the first to remove the exception, then Nebraska and Utah in 2020? Wait, no. Colorado did it in 2018 via Amendment A. So before 2022, there were 20 states, but after Colorado, Utah, Nebraska, etc., maybe the number was already lower. Hmm. So maybe the initial count before 2022 was 20, but after 2022's four states passing, the total would be 20 -4=16. But if other states had already removed it before 2022, like Colorado in 2018, then the initial number would be different. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to find a reliable source. For example, according to the ACLU, as of 2022, 20 states still had constitutions that permitted slavery or involuntary servitude as punishment. Then, in November 2022, four states passed amendments (Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont), and Louisiana's failed. So that would leave 20 -4=16. However, in 2023, other states might have done the same. For example, in 2023, Minnesota passed an amendment. If that's the case, then by November 2024, maybe 16 -1=15. But I don't know if Minnesota did that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count is 16. But without information on changes in 2023-2024, the safest answer based on known data up to 2022 would be 16. However, the question is as of November 2024. Suppose that from 2022 to 2024, two more states passed amendments. But without specific data, it's hard to say. If the question is in November 2024, and if no other states changed after 2022, then it's 16. But maybe more have changed. However, given the lack of information post-2022, the best answer would be 16. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 20-4=16, but if other states like Colorado, Utah, and Nebraska had done it before 2022, then the count was already lower. \n\nWait, Colorado passed Amendment A in 2018, removing the exception. Nebraska and Utah did similar in 2020. So prior to 2022, those three had already removed it. So if originally 20, minus 3 (CO, NE, UT) and minus the 4 in 2022, that would be 20-3-4=13. But I'm not sure. The initial number of states with such language was 23, perhaps. Because after Colorado, Nebraska, Utah, and the 2022 states, maybe. But this is getting too uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 16. Given the information I have, in 2022, four states removed it, so 20-4=16. However, if other states had done so before, the number would be lower. But the question is as of November 2024. Given that the user is asking for an exact number, and assuming that up to November 2024, no further states have amended their constitutions beyond the 2022 changes, the answer would be 16. Therefore, I'll go with 16 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The 13th Amendment allows involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime.
