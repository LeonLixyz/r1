  "question": "When viewed as matrices, which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the flags of African nations and their linear algebraic rank compared to Denmark's flag. Hmm. First, I need to recall what the flag of Denmark looks like. Denmark's flag is called the Dannebrog. It has a white Scandinavian cross that extends to the edges of the red background. The cross is offset towards the hoist side. So, in matrix terms, how would that translate?\n\nWell, if we consider the flag as a matrix where each element represents a pixel's color, the rank would relate to the linear independence of the rows or columns. The Danish flag's design has a cross, which might create a structure where the rows or columns aren't all linearly independent. For example, the white cross might create rows that are combinations of others, lowering the rank. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nWait, let me think. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. So, a flag with a simple design that can be represented with fewer independent vectors would have a lower rank. The Danish flag's cross might split the flag into regions of red and white. If the cross is uniform in color, maybe the rows or columns in the matrix have dependencies. For instance, if two rows are identical except for a small part, maybe their difference could be another row, leading to lower rank. But I'm not entirely sure how this applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag can be represented as a matrix where each color is a different value, and we're considering the rank of that matrix. For example, if the cross divides the flag into four red rectangles and a white cross, the matrix might have a certain rank based on how the colors are arranged. If the white cross creates vertical and horizontal lines, maybe the rank is lower because those lines add structure. But how does that compare to African flags?\n\nNow, the question is asking which African flags have the same rank as Denmark's. So I need to find African flags with a similar structure that would result in the same matrix rank. Let's think of African flags with crosses or similar simple geometric patterns.\n\nFor example, the flag of Kenya has horizontal stripes and a Maasai shield and spears, which might complicate the rank. The flag of South Africa has a Y-shaped design with multiple colors, which would probably have a higher rank. Then there's the flag of Nigeria, which is three vertical stripes (green-white-green). In matrix terms, vertical stripes might result in columns that are copies, so the rank could be lower. If the vertical stripes are all green on the sides and white in the middle, maybe the matrix columns for green and white are repeated, leading to a rank of 2? Because there are two distinct columns (green and white) repeated.\n\nDenmark's flag has a cross, which might be represented with a combination of rows and columns. Let's say the cross is a horizontal and vertical line. If the rest of the flag is red, then maybe the rank would be higher. Wait, if the cross is two lines (horizontal and vertical), could that create dependencies? For instance, if we model the flag's matrix as red and white elements, the cross could be represented by rows where a certain segment is white, and the rest red. Depending on how the cross is structured, the rank could vary. Maybe the Danish flag's matrix has rank 2 because the cross introduces two independent directions (horizontal and vertical), but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Danish flag's matrix has a rank of 2. Let's consider a simplified version. Suppose the flag is a 3x3 matrix where the center row and column are white, and the rest are red. The matrix might look like:\n\nR R R\nR W R\nR R R\n\nWait, no, that's a cross in the center. But in reality, Denmark's cross is offset. But maybe for simplicity, if we model the cross as two lines (horizontal and vertical), then the matrix could be decomposed into two rank 1 matrices: one for the horizontal white line and one for the vertical. Then the total rank would be 2. If that's the case, then any flag with a similar cross structure would also have rank 2.\n\nSo looking for African flags with a similar cross design. The flag of Jamaica has a saltire (diagonal cross), but Jamaica isn't in Africa. Wait, African flags with crosses. The flag of Burundi has a saltire. The flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has a diagonal stripe. Wait, let's think again. Which African countries have flags with crosses?\n\nWait, the flag of Malawi has a rising sun, but not a cross. The flag of Eswatini (Swaziland) has a shield and spears. Let me think. The flag of Ghana has horizontal stripes with a black star. No cross. The flag of Senegal has a green star. Hmm. How about the flag of Algeria? It has a crescent and star. The flag of Cape Verde has a circle of stars. Maybe not crosses.\n\nWait, the flag of Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory and has a Union Jack, but that's not an African nation's flag. Wait, maybe the flag of Mauritius. The flag of Mauritius has four horizontal stripes (red, blue, yellow, green). That's four horizontal stripes, which might be similar to other flags. If the stripes are horizontal, each row in the matrix would be the same color, leading to rows being linearly dependent. For example, if the flag has four equal horizontal stripes, then the rows in each stripe would be identical. So the rank might be equal to the number of distinct colors, but I think that's not exactly right. Because each stripe's rows are the same, so the rows are multiples of each other. So if there are four horizontal stripes of different colors, the matrix would have four different rows, but if each stripe is multiple rows of the same color, then those rows are identical. So for example, if the flag is divided into four equal horizontal stripes, each stripe has multiple rows of the same color. So the matrix would have four different row vectors (assuming each color is a unique value), but each repeated several times. So the rank would be 4 if all four colors are linearly independent. But if the colors can be represented as combinations, maybe less. But in terms of a matrix where each color is a different numerical value (like RGB), the rank would depend on how the colors are arranged. Horizontal stripes would result in a matrix where each row in a stripe is the same, so the rank would be the number of distinct rows. If all four stripes are different colors, then the rank would be 4. However, if the colors are arranged such that some rows are combinations of others, the rank could be lower. But this depends on the specific color encoding.\n\nWait, maybe a vertical tricolor flag, like Nigeria's, which is green-white-green. If the flag has three vertical stripes, then each column is the same color. So the columns would be [green, green, ...], [white, white, ...], [green, green, ...]. So the column vectors would be two distinct vectors (green and white), with the middle column being white and the others green. So the column rank would be 2, because there are two linearly independent columns. Similarly, a horizontal tricolor would have row rank equal to the number of colors, but vertical tricolors have column rank equal to the number of vertical colors.\n\nDenmark's flag has a cross, which introduces both horizontal and vertical elements. If the cross is represented as a horizontal white stripe and a vertical white stripe over a red background, then perhaps the rank is 2. Because the horizontal and vertical stripes could each be rank 1, and combined they form rank 2.\n\nSo if an African nation's flag has a similar structure where the design introduces two linearly independent vectors, then its rank would be the same as Denmark's. The Nigerian flag, with vertical stripes, has two colors (green and white) in columns, so column rank 2. If the matrix is considered as columns, then rank 2. Similarly, Denmark's flag might have rank 2. Therefore, if the answer is Nigeria, then the rank matches.\n\nAlternatively, another African flag with vertical stripes. Let's see. The flag of Benin has two horizontal yellow and red stripes and a green vertical stripe at the hoist. That's a bit more complex. The flag of Guinea has three vertical stripes: red, yellow, green. So three colors vertically. If each column is a different color, the column rank would be 3. So rank 3. But Nigeria's is three vertical stripes with two colors (green, white, green). So columns are green, white, green. So the columns are [green, ..., green], [white, ..., white], [green, ..., green]. Therefore, the column space is spanned by the green and white vectors, so rank 2.\n\nSimilarly, Denmark's flag, if it's structured with horizontal and vertical elements that are each rank 1, combining to rank 2, then Nigeria's flag would also have rank 2. Therefore, the answer is Nigeria.\n\nBut wait, are there other African flags with two vertical colors? For example, the flag of Mali is green, yellow, red vertical stripes. So three colors. Rank 3. The flag of Senegal is green, yellow, red vertical stripes with a green star in the center. That complicates the matrix. The flag of Cameroon has vertical stripes: green, red, yellow with a star. Again, maybe higher rank.\n\nThe flag of Togo has five horizontal stripes and a white star, which might be more complex. So maybe the Nigerian flag is the one with vertical stripes of two colors (green and white), leading to column rank 2. If Denmark's flag also has rank 2, then they match.\n\nAnother possibility: the flag of Libya (old flag, pre-2011) was plain green, which would have rank 1. But that's not the case anymore. The current Libyan flag has horizontal stripes with a crescent and star, which might be more complex.\n\nWait, what about the flag of Mauritania? It has a green background with a gold crescent and star. That might have higher rank due to the symbols. The flag of Somalia has a light blue background with a white star. The star might increase the rank.\n\nSo the Nigerian flag, with three vertical stripes (green, white, green), has columns that are green, white, green. So the column vectors would be two distinct vectors (green and white), hence column rank 2. If the matrix is considered as columns, then the rank is 2. If Denmark's flag also has rank 2, then the answer is Nigeria.\n\nDenmark's flag's matrix: if we model the white cross on a red background, the cross could be considered as two lines. Each line (horizontal and vertical) could be a rank 1 matrix, and their combination would be rank 2. Therefore, the overall rank is 2.\n\nThus, the Nigerian flag has rank 2, same as Denmark's. Therefore, the answer is Nigeria.\n",
  "raw_response": "\n\nExplanation: The flag of Denmark features a white Scandinavian cross on a red background, which can be represented as a matrix with a rank of 2 due to the linear independence introduced by the horizontal and vertical cross elements. Among African flags, Nigeria's flag consists of three vertical stripes (green, white, green). When viewed as a matrix, the vertical stripes reduce column independence: the columns are either green or white, resulting in a column rank of 2. This matches Denmark's rank, as both flags derive their rank from two independent vectors (horizontal/vertical cross for Denmark and two distinct colors for Nigeria).\n\nAnswer: Nigeria  \nConfidence: 85%",
