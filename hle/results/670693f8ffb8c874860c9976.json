  "question": "What is the name of the once-off The Simpsons character who \"dances for nickels\"?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about a one-time character from The Simpsons who \"dances for nickels.\" Hmm, I need to remember that. The Simpsons has so many characters, especially those that only appear once.\n\nFirst, I recall that there's an episode where a hobo or a vagrant character is involved. Wait, the phrase \"dances for nickels\" sounds familiar. Maybe it's from the episode where Bart meets a homeless man. Oh right, there's an episode called \"Homer's Phobia\" where they meet a guy named John, but I think that's more about the antique collector. Not that one.\n\nWait, maybe it's from the episode \"Bart Gets an Elephant.\" No, that's about the elephant stampede. Alternatively, there's the character known as \"The Wiggum.\" No, that's Chief Wiggum. Maybe it's from an older season. Let me think about the hobo characters. There's a hobo in the episode where Lisa becomes a vegetarian, \"Lisa the Vegetarian,\" where a tramp says something like \"You don't win friends with salad.\" But does he dance for nickels?\n\nAlternatively, there's the character called \"Bleeding Gums Murphy,\" but he's a jazz musician. Not that. Wait, another thought: there's an episode where Bart and Milhouse meet a hobo in the woods. The hobo tells them a story and does a little dance. Oh right! In the episode \"Bart of Darkness,\" which is a parody of \"Rear Window,\" Bart breaks his leg and watches the neighborhood. But I'm not sure if the hobo is in that episode. Wait, maybe it's from \"Bart the Fink\" where they meet a hobo named \"Roy\" who's a bank robber. But does he dance for nickels?\n\nWait, another possibility: the character might be \"Larry the Looter,\" but no, that's from a different context. Alternatively, the hobo in \"Homer the Vigilante\" where they have a character who's a thief. Wait, maybe it's the Hobo from the episode where they go to the Hullabalooza music festival. No, that's more about the music.\n\nWait, I remember a specific line where a character says, \"I dance for nickels.\" Let me think. Oh! The character might be \"Mr. McGreg,\" who has a scene where he's dancing for coins. Wait, but I'm mixing up maybe different characters. Alternatively, it's the hobo that Bart and Lisa meet in the episode where they run away, but I can't remember the exact episode title.\n\nWait, perhaps the character is named \"Frank Grimes\" (Grimey), but he's a one-time character who works at the power plant. No, he doesn't dance for nickels. Hmm. Maybe \"Disco Stu\" but he's recurring. Alternatively, \"Hank Scorpio\" from the James Bond parody episode. No, that's not related. \n\nWait, perhaps the character is from the episode where Bart gets a helper monkey. No. Wait, there's an episode where Bart and Milhouse are in the treehouse, and a hobo comes by. The hobo says something like \"I used to be a businessman, then I lost everything. Now I dance for nickels.\" Then he does a little dance. I think that's the one. I believe the character is named \"Roy\" or something similar. But I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe his name is \"Larry the hobo.\" Wait, in the episode \"Bart the Fink,\" which is season 7, episode 15, Bart turns a bank robber into the authorities. The robber, named Roy, is a hobo who later escapes and comes after Bart. But I'm not sure if he's the one dancing for nickels. Wait, in that episode, when Bart first meets Roy, Roy is panhandling and says he dances for nickels. Then he does a little jig. So the character's name is Roy, and he only appears in that one episode. So the answer would be Roy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's another name, but I'm pretty sure that's the episode. Let me check my memory. Yes, in \"Bart the Fink,\" Roy is a hobo who later is revealed to have a secret identity. The line \"dances for nickels\" is from that episode. So the answer should be Roy.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The character in question is Roy, a one-time character from the episode \"Bart the Fink\" (Season 7, Episode 15). Roy initially presents himself as a hobo who claims to \"dance for nickels\" and performs a jig for Bart. Later, it's revealed he's actually a bank robber in disguise. This aligns with the description provided in the question.\n\nAnswer: Roy  \nConfidence: 95%",
