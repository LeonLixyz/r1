  "question": "Assume the JTB definition of Knowledge, which suggests that \"Knowledge is a Justified True Belief\". If our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, what are the two problems JTB runs into? Ignore Gettier problems.",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the two problems that the JTB (Justified True Belief) account of knowledge runs into, ignoring Gettier problems. Let me start by recalling what JTB says. According to JTB, knowledge is a belief that is both true and justified. So, for someone to know something, three conditions must be met: they believe it, it's true, and they have justification for believing it.\n\nThe question mentions to ignore Gettier problems, which are cases where a person has a justified true belief that isn't knowledge due to some epistemic luck. Since Gettier is excluded, I need to think of other traditional problems with JTB.\n\nHmm, from what I remember, before Gettier, there were other criticisms of JTB. Two main issues come to mind. The first might be the problem of justification itself. Like, what counts as sufficient justification? If the justification is too weak, then even if a belief is true, it might not be knowledge. For example, someone could have a true belief with weak justification, but is that knowledge? But maybe that's more about defining justification.\n\nWait, another problem is the distinction between knowledge and belief. If knowledge is a subset of belief (specifically justified and true ones), then how do we handle cases where a belief is true and justified but still not knowledge? But Gettier cases are exactly that, so since we are supposed to ignore them, maybe there are other issues.\n\nOh right, there's the issue of the \"truth\" condition. How do we account for the fact that a belief being true is external to the believer's perspective. So, if someone has a justified belief that turns out to be true by accident, but without the right connection between justification and truth, that's a problem. But again, that seems like Gettier.\n\nWait, maybe the two problems are different. Let me think again. The traditional problems could be:\n\n1. The problem of having a justified true belief that isn't knowledge, but since Gettier is excluded, perhaps the other problem is the converse: knowledge without justified true belief? But I don't think that's the case. JTB is supposed to be necessary and sufficient for knowledge. So if there's a case where JTB is present but it's not knowledge (Gettier), but since we can't use that, maybe the other problem is when knowledge exists without one of the JTB conditions, but JTB claims all three are necessary. So perhaps the issues are different.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the two problems are related to the justification being circular or infinite regress. Like, how do we justify the justification? That's the problem of the criterion or epistemic regress. But I'm not sure if that's considered a problem specifically for JTB as a definition.\n\nAlternatively, the two problems could be:\n\n1. The distinction between knowledge and belief: if all knowledge is belief, but not all beliefs are knowledge, then how does JTB account for the difference? But JTB does that by adding justification and truth. So maybe the problem is that JTB is too broad or too narrow.\n\nWait, the original question asks for two problems JTB runs into when our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief. So, perhaps the problems are related to the classification. Let's see.\n\nFirst problem: If we only have Knowledge and Belief as categories, then any justified true belief is knowledge. But there might be cases where a belief is justified but not true, so it's a belief. But then, the problem is that justification isn't sufficient for truth, so the fact that a belief can be justified but false. However, in JTB, knowledge requires both justification and truth. So maybe the problem is that JTB allows that a belief could be justified but not true, which falls under belief, but when it's true, it becomes knowledge. But how does that challenge JTB?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of having a true belief that isn't justified (so it's a belief but not knowledge). But according to JTB, knowledge must be justified, so that's handled. So that's not a problem for JTB.\n\nWait, maybe the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of a justified belief that is true but not knowledge (Gettier, but we ignore that here).\n\nSo, without considering Gettier, maybe the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of defining justification adequately. For instance, what counts as justification? If justification is too easy, then JTB might allow for lucky true beliefs as knowledge. But since Gettier is excluded, perhaps this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, the two classic problems (pre-Gettier) might be:\n\n1. The problem of the truth condition: Since truth is an external factor, a person might not have access to whether their belief is true. So how can a person ever know they have knowledge, since they can't be certain their belief is true? This could lead to skepticism.\n\n2. The problem of the justification leading to truth. If justification doesn't guarantee truth, then JTB might not adequately capture knowledge. For example, a belief could be justified (according to some standard) but still false. So, JTB requires both, but the issue is that justification doesn't ensure truth, making the combination somewhat arbitrary.\n\nBut maybe another angle is that JTB is insufficient because there are cases where knowledge doesn't require belief (but that's not typical; knowledge is usually taken to require belief). Alternatively, perhaps the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of necessary truths. For example, someone might believe a necessary truth without justification. If they happen to believe it, even if it's necessarily true, does that count as knowledge? JTB says no, because it needs justification. But maybe that's not a problem, because JTB correctly excludes it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two problems are:\n\n1. The distinction between knowledge and belief becomes too rigid. If a belief is justified and true, it's knowledge; otherwise, it's mere belief. But perhaps there are degrees of justification that JTB doesn't account for, leading to a binary division that's problematic.\n\nAlternatively, the two problems might be:\n\n1. The problem of false beliefs that are justified. Since JTB requires truth, these are not knowledge, but if someone has a justified belief that is false, they don't know. But JTB handles that.\n\nWait, maybe the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of the \"get luck\" cases (but Gettier is excluded).\n\n2. The problem of the justification itself being circular or leading to infinite regress.\n\nAlternatively, the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of the truth condition being external, leading to the possibility that a person cannot know for sure if they have knowledge, since truth is beyond their perspective.\n\n2. The problem of defining justification in a way that is neither too strict nor too lenient, which could lead to over-inclusion or under-inclusion of beliefs as knowledge.\n\nAlternatively, think about the \"No False Lemmas\" approach, but that's responding to Gettier.\n\nWait, let me check standard philosophy references. The traditional objections to JTB before Gettier were:\n\n- The problem of the truth condition: If a belief must be true to count as knowledge, then we can never be certain we have knowledge because truth is external. This relates to skepticism.\n\n- The problem of justification: What counts as adequate justification? Different theories (foundationalism, coherentism, infinitism) try to solve this, but under JTB, if the justification is insufficient, even a true belief wouldn't be knowledge if the justification isn't right. But how do we determine when justification is sufficient?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of \"lucky\" true beliefs that are justified but where the justification doesn't connect to the truth in the right way (Gettier), but since we can't use that, maybe another problem.\n\nWait, another classic problem with JTB: the distinction between knowledge and justified true belief. But again, that's what Gettier addressed. Since we can't use that, perhaps the other issues are the two I mentioned earlier: skepticism due to the external truth condition and the challenge of defining justification appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of the \"fourth condition\": JTB may be necessary but not sufficient (which is what Gettier showed), but since we ignore Gettier, perhaps other issues.\n\nWait, perhaps the two problems are:\n\n1. The problem of known entailment (infinite justification). For example, if I know P, and P entails Q, do I have to know all the entailments to know Q? This could lead to an infinite regress in justification.\n\n2. The problem of empirical knowledge: How can empirical beliefs ever be justified sufficiently under JTB? If justification requires infallible evidence, then empirical knowledge is impossible, leading to skepticism.\n\nAlternatively, more accurately, the two main problems (without Gettier) could be:\n\n1. The problem of the truth condition leading to skepticism: since truth is external and not accessible, we can't be sure our justified beliefs are true.\n\n2. The problem of the justification's source: whether justification is internal (based on mental states) or external (based on reliable processes), which JTB might not address, leading to debates between internalism and externalism.\n\nBut maybe the answer expected here is:\n\nThe two problems are:\n\n1. Infallibility vs. fallibility of justification: If justification requires that the belief cannot be false (infallible), then very few things count as knowledge. But if it's fallible (justification that could be wrong), then JTB allows for justified beliefs that are true, but this might not be sufficient for knowledge (which is the Gettier problem, but since we're ignoring that, maybe this is still a problem in terms of whether fallible justification is enough).\n\n2. The problem of the truth condition being external: Since the truth of a belief isn't something the believer can always ascertain, how can they ever know they have knowledge? This leads to issues of skepticism.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the two problems might be that JTB is either too permissive or too restrictive. For example, too permissive in allowing some justified true beliefs that aren't knowledge (Gettier) and too restrictive in excluding some knowledge that doesn't meet JTB. But since Gettier is excluded, maybe the two are different.\n\nWait, maybe the two problems are:\n\n1. The distinction between justification and truth: since truth is a separate condition, a person can have a justified belief that is false, which is just a belief. But when it happens to be true, it becomes knowledge. The problem here is that the justification doesn't necessarily link to the truth, making knowledge somewhat accidental when it's true. But without the right connection, JTB might not capture genuine knowledge.\n\n2. The accessibility of truth: Since truth is a condition outside the believer's perspective, JTB might imply that one can't know whether they have knowledge, because they can't be certain their belief is true. This leads to skepticism about knowledge.\n\nAlternatively, another standard problem is the case of \"defeated justification\". Suppose a person has a justified true belief, but there's some evidence they don't possess that would defeat their justification. For example, they believe the room is warm based on feeling warm, which is true, but they don't know the thermostat is broken. In that case, their justification is defeated, so even though the belief is true and justified (they felt warm), it's not knowledge. But this is a Gettier-like case, perhaps, so maybe not.\n\nPutting this together, the two main problems JTB faces, aside from Gettier, are likely:\n\n1. The problem of the truth condition being external, leading to skepticism about whether we can ever know we have knowledge since we can't be certain our beliefs are true.\n\n2. The problem of defining justification in a way that adequately supports the truth of the belief without being circular or leading to an infinite regress.\n\nAlternatively, the two problems could be:\n\n1. The challenge of adequately defining justification (the justification problem).\n\n2. The issue that truth is an external factor, making it difficult to bridge the gap between justification and truth (the truth connection problem).\n\nYes, those seem plausible. So the answer would list these two problems. Let me check standard philosophy sources to confirm.\n\nUpon reflection, traditional issues with JTB (pre-Gettier) include:\n\n- The justification condition: How strong must the justification be? If it's too weak, then JTB allows lucky true beliefs as knowledge. If too strong, it leads to skepticism because we can't have such strong justification.\n\n- The truth condition: Because truth is mind-independent, JTB makes knowledge depend on external factors that the believer might not have access to, leading to skepticism.\n\nSo the two problems would be:\n\n1. The problem of specifying the appropriate level of justification required for knowledge without falling into skepticism or allowing accidental truths.\n\n2. The problem that the truth condition makes knowledge depend on an external factor that the believer cannot be certain of, leading to difficulties in claiming knowledge.\n\nThus, the answer would be these two problems.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge faces two key problems, excluding Gettier cases:  \n1. **The Problem of Justification**: Defining \"justification\" adequately is challenging. If justification is too weak, it may allow for accidental true beliefs (e.g., lucky guesses) to count as knowledge, undermining the reliability of justification. Conversely, overly strict justification standards risk skepticism, as few beliefs might meet such criteria.  \n2. **The Truth Condition's Externality**: Truth is an external condition outside the believer\u2019s perspective. Since individuals cannot infallibly verify the truth of their beliefs, JTB makes knowledge contingent on factors inaccessible to the believer, raising skeptical concerns about whether we can ever confidently claim to \"know\" something.  \n\nAnswer: The two problems are (1) defining justification sufficiently to avoid accidental truths and skepticism, and (2) the external truth condition creating a gap between justification and certainty.  \nConfidence: 90%",
