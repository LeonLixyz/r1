  "question": "Let \\( p \\) be an odd prime, and let \\( a \\) be an integer coprime to \\( p \\). Using properties of nested exponentiation, calculate \\( a^{p^{p-1} - p + 1} \\mod p^2 \\)",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking to compute \\( a^{p^{p-1} - p + 1} \\mod p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is an odd prime and \\( a \\) is coprime to \\( p \\). Hmm, so I need to use properties of exponents modulo primes and their powers. Let me recall some relevant theorems.\n\nFirst off, since \\( a \\) and \\( p \\) are coprime, Fermat's Little Theorem comes to mind. Fermat's tells us that \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\). But here the modulus is \\( p^2 \\), not just \\( p \\), so maybe I need something stronger like Euler's theorem or the lifting the exponent lemma (Hensel's lemma). \n\nEuler's theorem states that if \\( a \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, then \\( a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n \\). For \\( n = p^2 \\), Euler's totient function \\( \\phi(p^2) = p^2 - p \\). So Euler's theorem would give \\( a^{p(p-1)} \\equiv 1 \\mod p^2 \\). Wait, the exponent here is \\( p^{p-1} - p +1 \\). That's a bit different. Let's see what the exponent is exactly.\n\nThe exponent is \\( p^{p-1} - p + 1 \\). Let me try to simplify or find a pattern here. Maybe I can express this exponent in terms of \\( \\phi(p^2) = p(p-1) \\). Let's compute \\( p^{p-1} \\mod \\phi(p^2) \\), but not sure if that's useful. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that for exponents modulo \\( \\phi(p^2) \\), because of Euler's theorem, but the exponent here is much larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for modulus \\( p^2 \\), there's a theorem related to the expansion of exponents. Wait, I remember something called lifting the exponent for primes. For example, if \\( a \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\), then \\( a^{kp} \\equiv 1 + kp(a - 1)/1! \\mod p^2 \\). But here, we don't know if \\( a \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\). However, since \\( a \\) is coprime to \\( p \\), by Fermat, \\( a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\), so \\( a^{p-1} = 1 + mp \\) for some integer m. Then, raising both sides to the power p, via the binomial theorem: \\( (1 + mp)^p \\equiv 1 + m p \\cdot p + \\text{higher terms} \\mod p^2 \\), so \\( a^{(p-1)p} \\equiv 1 \\mod p^2 \\). Wait, this seems like Euler's theorem again, which gives the same result.\n\nSo, \\( a^{p(p-1)} \\equiv 1 \\mod p^2 \\). That means that the multiplicative order of a modulo \\( p^2 \\) divides \\( p(p-1) \\). But our exponent here is \\( p^{p-1} - p +1 \\). Let me see how that relates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that \\( a^{p^{p-1}} \\mod p^2 \\). Wait, but the exponent is \\( p^{p-1} - p +1 \\). Let me split the exponent into two parts. Let's write it as \\( a^{p^{p-1} - p +1} = a^{p^{p-1}} \\cdot a^{-p +1} \\). But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor the exponent.\n\nAlternatively, notice that \\( p^{p-1} \\) is a multiple of \\( p(p-1) \\)? Not sure. Let's check for small primes. Let's take p=3. Then \\( p^{p-1}=3^2=9 \\), and \\( p(p-1)=3*2=6. 9 is a multiple of 6? No, 9=6*1 +3. So no. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, for p=3, the exponent is 3^(3-1) -3 +1=9-3+1=7. So the exponent is 7. Then, what is a^7 mod 9? Since a and 3 are coprime, let's take a=2. Then 2^7=128 mod 9. 128 divided by 9 is 14*9=126, so 128-126=2. So 2 mod 9. But 2 mod 3 is 2, and 2^1 mod 3 is 2, so maybe 2^7 mod 9=2. Similarly, if a=2: a^7 mod 9=2. Let's take another a, say a=4. 4 and 9 are coprime. 4^7=16384. 16384 divided by 9: 9*1820=16380, so remainder 4. So 4^7 mod9=4. Hmm, interesting. So in p=3 case, the result is a mod 9. Wait, but 2 mod9 is 2, which is 2, and 4 mod9 is 4. So for p=3, the result is a mod9. Wait, but 7=3^2 -3 +1 -3^2? Wait, exponent is p^{p-1} -p +1=9-3+1=7. And a^7 mod9= a mod9. Wait, for a=2, 2^7=128 mod9=2. For a=4, 4^7 mod9=4. So seems like a^7 \u2261a mod9. Similarly, if we check a=5: 5 mod9=5. 5^7 mod9. 5^2=25\u22617, 5^4=7^2=49\u22614, 5^6\u22614*7=28\u22611, so 5^7=5^6 *5 \u22611*5=5 mod9. So yes, 5^7\u22615 mod9. Similarly, 7^7: 7 mod9=7. 7^2=49\u22614, 7^4=16\u22617, 7^6=7^4 *7^2 \u22617*4=28\u22611, so 7^7\u22611*7=7 mod9. So in all cases, a^7\u2261a mod9. Therefore, for p=3, the answer is a mod p^2. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So perhaps in general, \\( a^{p^{p-1} -p +1} \\equiv a \\mod p^2 \\). Let's check another prime, say p=5. Then the exponent is 5^4 -5 +1=625-5+1=621. So compute a^621 mod25.\n\nIf this holds, for example, take a=2. 2 and 25 are coprime. Let's compute 2^621 mod25. Note that \u03c6(25)=20. So by Euler's theorem, 2^20 \u22611 mod25. Then 621 divided by 20 is 31*20=620, remainder 1. So 2^621=2^(20*31 +1)= (2^20)^31 *2^1 \u22611^31 *2=2 mod25. Which is equal to a=2 mod25. Similarly, take a=3. 3^621 mod25. 3^20\u22611 mod25. 621=31*20 +1, so 3^621\u22613^1=3 mod25. So again, a^621\u2261a mod25. Similarly, a=7. 7^20\u22611 mod25, so 7^621\u22617 mod25. So it seems that for p=5, this also holds. So maybe the general result is that the expression is congruent to a modulo p^2.\n\nThus, the answer might be a mod p^2, that is, the answer is a. Wait, but the problem says \"calculate \\( a^{p^{p-1} - p + 1} \\mod p^2 \\)\". So the answer is congruent to a modulo p^2. Therefore, the answer is simply a. But let's confirm with another example. Let's take p=5, a=6. Then compute 6^621 mod25. Since 6 and 25 are coprime. 6^20\u22611 mod25. 621=31*20 +1. So 6^621 \u22616^1=6 mod25. Which is indeed 6 mod25. So it works.\n\nSo this suggests that the expression \\( a^{p^{p-1} - p +1} \\mod p^2 \\) is congruent to a modulo p^2. Therefore, the answer is simply a. But why does this hold?\n\nLet me think. So exponent is E = p^{p-1} - p +1. Let's write E as E = p^{p-1} - (p -1). Then, E = (p^{p-1} -1) - (p -1) +1? Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, notice that in the examples, when we had p=3, E=7, and 7 mod \u03c6(9)=6 is 1. So 7=6*1 +1, so a^7 \u2261a^1 mod9. Similarly for p=5, \u03c6(25)=20, E=621, 621 mod20=1. So 621=20*31 +1. Therefore, a^621 \u2261a^1 mod25. Therefore, in general, if E \u22611 mod \u03c6(p^2), then a^E \u2261a^1 modp^2. Since \u03c6(p^2)=p(p-1). So is E \u22611 mod p(p-1)?\n\nCompute E = p^{p-1} - p +1. Let's check modulo p(p-1). Let's compute E mod p(p-1). \n\nFirst, compute p^{p-1} mod p(p-1). Since p and p-1 are coprime (since p is prime), we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's compute modulo p and modulo p-1.\n\nModulo p: p^{p-1} \u22610 mod p, and -p +1 \u2261-0 +1=1 mod p. So E \u22610 +1=1 mod p.\n\nModulo p-1: Let's compute p^{p-1} mod p-1. Since p \u22611 mod p-1, so p^{p-1} \u22611^{p-1}=1 mod p-1. Then, -p +1 mod p-1: -p +1 \u2261 -1 +1=0 mod p-1. So E \u22611 +0=1 mod p-1.\n\nTherefore, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, since E \u22611 mod p and E \u22611 mod p-1, then E \u22611 mod lcm(p, p-1). But since p and p-1 are coprime, lcm(p, p-1)=p(p-1). Therefore, E \u22611 mod p(p-1). Therefore, E =1 + k p(p-1) for some integer k.\n\nTherefore, by Euler's theorem, a^{p(p-1)} \u22611 modp^2. Therefore, a^{E} = a^{1 + k p(p-1)} = a * (a^{p(p-1)})^k \u2261a *1^k \u2261a modp^2. Therefore, the result is a modp^2. Since a is coprime to p^2, but the problem states a is coprime to p, which is the same since p^2's divisors are 1, p, p^2. So a being coprime to p implies a coprime to p^2 as well. Therefore, the answer is a modulo p^2. Therefore, the answer is a, and the expression simplifies to a modp^2.\n\nHence, the answer is \\( \\boxed{a} \\).\n",
