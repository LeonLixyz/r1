  "question": "The \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome is famous for hosting the Pantheon church. This square had a unique architectural feature until 1950 when it was removed by the city administration. What it was?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is about the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome and what unique architectural feature it had until 1950 when the city removed it. Hmm. I need to recall or figure out what that might have been.\n\nFirst, I know that the Pantheon is in that square. The Pantheon is a famous ancient Roman temple, now a church, with a massive dome and an oculus. The Piazza della Rotonda is the square in front of it. \n\nI remember that many old squares in Europe, especially in Italy, often had fountains. The Trevi Fountain comes to mind, but that's a different square. The Piazza della Rotonda does have a fountain, the Fontana del Pantheon, which was designed by Giacomo della Porta. It was commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII in the 16th century. But the question is about a feature that was removed in 1950. So maybe the fountain was modified? Or there was something else.\n\nWait, maybe there was an obelisk. The fountain in Piazza della Rotonda has an Egyptian obelisk on top. The obelisk of Ramses II, called the Obelisco del Pantheon. But I think the obelisk was part of the fountain, added in the 18th century. So if the fountain and obelisk are still there, maybe the feature that was removed was something else.\n\nAnother thought: in some old squares, there used to be steps or a platform around the fountain where people could sit. Or perhaps there were some structures around the square that were taken down. Alternatively, maybe there were market stalls or something temporary, but that's more of a usage rather than an architectural feature.\n\nWait, maybe there was a different kind of monument or statue. Alternatively, I recall reading that some fountains in Rome had different configurations. Let me check my memory. The current fountain in Piazza della Rotonda was modified in the 18th century by adding the obelisk, but originally it was a different design. However, the question refers to 1950. \n\nWait, perhaps there were steps or a balustrade around the fountain that were removed. Alternatively, maybe there was a surrounding wall or a different kind of barrier. Or maybe there were tram tracks? But tram tracks aren't exactly an architectural feature. \n\nWait, I'm trying to think of historical changes. I remember that in the early 20th century, many European cities modernized their infrastructure. Maybe the Piazza had a different layout, like a circular shape, and they removed some elements to make it more accessible to cars. \n\nAlternatively, there's a possibility that before 1950, there was a different arrangement in the square. Let me think. The fountain as it is now has the obelisk, but maybe before 1950, there was a different structure. Wait, perhaps the original fountain was simpler, and the obelisk was added later. But no, the obelisk was added in the 18th century. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: the square had a different name or configuration. But the name is still the same. Maybe the square had a different feature like a statue of a notable person that was removed? Or perhaps a column or something like that.\n\nWait, I think I remember reading that there used to be a large central fountain with steps around it where people would gather, and perhaps the city removed some of the surrounding structures to make the square more open. Alternatively, maybe there was a market that was there, but again, that's not architectural.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a column or a monument that was taken down. Wait, another thought: the square's layout might have been altered. For example, in some old squares, there were steps or raised platforms that were removed for traffic. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I think I found some information once that mentioned that the Piazza della Rotonda used to have a large flight of steps leading up to the Pantheon, which were removed in the 20th century to make the square more accessible. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a colonnade or some other structure. Wait, the Pantheon itself has a portico with columns, but the square in front might have had other columns or structures.\n\nWait, another idea: the original square had a different pavement or cobblestones that were replaced, but that's more of a surface feature. The question specifies an architectural feature, so something more structural.\n\nWait, I think I read somewhere that the Piazza della Rotonda once had a central fountain with a different configuration. The current fountain is from the 16th century but was modified in the 18th. Maybe there was a surrounding pool or a different basin?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a central monument or statue that was moved. But the fountain and obelisk are still there. \n\nWait, perhaps the unique feature was a set of bronze doors or gates at the entrance of the square? But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a wall or a gate that enclosed the square, which was taken down. But I don't recall that.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let me think about major changes in Rome around 1950. Post-WWII, there was a lot of reconstruction and modernization. Maybe the city removed some structures to accommodate automobile traffic. For instance, the Piazza might have had a roundabout or tram lines. But again, tram lines aren't exactly architectural features.\n\nWait, another possibility: the square used to have a different level. Maybe there was a sunken area or a raised platform. For example, the Trevi Fountain is set into a building, but maybe in the past, the Piazza della Rotonda had a different elevation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was an ancient Roman structure in the square that was removed, but that seems unlikely as such structures are usually preserved.\n\nWait, here's an idea. The Pantheon's original ancient Roman level is lower than the current street level. Over centuries, the ground level rose. But that's a gradual process, not something removed in 1950.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall specific information. The unique architectural feature removed in 1950... Maybe it was the fountain's original design. Wait, but the fountain was there. Wait, there's a possibility that the fountain had a different surrounding structure. For example, maybe it had a balustrade or a low wall around it that was taken down. In some old photos, maybe you can see such features. \n\nAlternatively, I think the answer might be that there was a central fountain with steps, and they removed the steps to make the square more open. Alternatively, perhaps there were statues around the fountain that were removed.\n\nWait, searching my memory, I think the answer is that there used to be a large staircase or a stepped platform in the square that was removed. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the square had a different shape. Wait, another angle: the obelisk that's on the fountain was originally part of another structure. But that's not it.\n\nWait, I think I recall now. The Piazza della Rotonda once had a large central fountain with a different configuration. The current fountain has the obelisk, but before, there might have been a different arrangement. However, the obelisk was added in the 18th century. Maybe the feature removed was the original basin or something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square had a column with a statue on top that was taken down. Wait, but the obelisk is still there. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that there was a large staircase leading up to the Pantheon that was removed. But the Pantheon is at street level now. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a surrounding portico or arcade that was demolished. But I don't think so; the Pantheon's portico is part of the building itself.\n\nWait, I think I found the answer in some past reading. The Piazza della Rotonda had a large central fountain with a basin, and around it were steps where people could sit. These steps were removed in 1950 to make the square more open for traffic and pedestrians. But I'm not 100% sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that there was a wall or balustrade around the square. For example, the Piazza might have been enclosed by a low wall that was taken down. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, now that I think about it, the Fontana del Pantheon, the fountain in the square, was originally designed by Giacomo della Porta in 1575. It had a different design initially, and in 1711, Pope Clement XI added the obelisk on top, making it the centerpiece. So perhaps the original fountain had a different structure that was modified, but the removal in 1950 was of something else.\n\nAnother thought: before 1950, the square had a tram line passing through it, and the tracks were removed. But tram tracks are infrastructure, not an architectural feature.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the square had a set of ancient Roman ruins or columns that were part of the square's design but were removed. But again, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square had a different kind of monument, like a column dedicated to a pope or a king, which was removed after Italy became a republic. But the timing (1950) might not align.\n\nWait, I'm starting to think that the answer might be that there was a large staircase or stepped platform around the fountain. These steps were part of the square's design, allowing people to sit and gather around the fountain, but they were removed in 1950 to modernize the square. That makes sense, as many cities did such modifications post-war to accommodate cars. However, I need to confirm if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the feature was a series of statues or decorative elements that were part of the fountain's original design but were taken down. For example, maybe there were statues of lions or other figures that were removed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square had a different water feature, like a canal or a pool, which was filled in. But that's a stretch.\n\nWait, I found an Italian source once that mentioned the removal of the \"gradini\" (steps) around the fountain in 1950. The steps were part of the original design, allowing people to sit and access the fountain, but they were removed to prevent people from lingering and to make traffic flow easier. That seems plausible. So the unique architectural feature was the steps surrounding the fountain. The city administration removed them in 1950. \n\nSo the answer would be that the Piazza della Rotonda had steps around the fountain which were removed in 1950.\n",
