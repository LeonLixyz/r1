  "question": "Consider a 5x5 toroidal chessboard, where the board wraps around both horizontally and vertically. How many ways can you place 4 non-attacking queens on this board?",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. A toroidal chessboard means that the edges wrap around, right? So if a queen is on the top row, she can attack the bottom row, and similarly for the columns. That complicates things because queens can attack across the edges.\n\nFirst, I remember that on a regular chessboard (non-toroidal), the number of ways to place n non-attacking queens is a classic problem. But here, the toroidal condition must change things. For a toroidal board, queens also can't attack along the diagonals that wrap around. Wait, maybe the problem requires that queens don't attack each other in any direction, including when the board wraps around. So, in addition to the usual rows, columns, and diagonals, we have to consider the toroidal diagonals as well.\n\nLet me recall that on a toroidal (modular) chessboard, one solution for n queens where n is not 1 or 5 mod 6 exists. Wait, but 5x5 is a specific case. Wait, but for n=5, the modular board might have some specific solutions. Wait, but here we are not placing 5 queens but 4. So maybe the standard n-queen solutions aren't directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this by considering that on a toroidal board, each queen must not share any row, column, or diagonal (including the ones that wrap). So for each queen placed, it blocks certain positions. But since the board is toroidal, each row and column has exactly 5 positions, and each diagonal (both normal and wrap-around) would also have 5 positions.\n\nBut how do you count the arrangements where 4 queens don't attack each other? Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, on a 5x5 board, each queen attacks in her row, column, and two diagonals. Because it's toroidal, the rows and columns are cyclic. So diagonals wrap around. For example, moving up-right from (1,5) would wrap to (2,1), etc. So, each diagonal direction (like northeast) has 5 diagonals, each of length 5. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: On a toroidal grid, diagonals become cycles. For example, a diagonal direction (1,1) would wrap around, so the diagonal would consist of (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), then back to (1,1). Similarly, a diagonal in the other direction (like 1,5 to 5,1) would also form a cycle.\n\nSo, on a 5x5 toroidal board, each square is part of two diagonal cycles. So, when placing a queen, she attacks all squares in her row, column, and both diagonals. So, when placing queens, each new queen cannot share a row, column, or either diagonal with any existing queen.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to placing 4 queens such that no two share a row, column, or diagonal. Since the board is 5x5, this is similar to the n-queens problem but on a torus and with n=4 on a 5x5 board. Wait, but the n-queens problem on a torus usually refers to placing n queens on an n x n board. Here, n=4 on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as selecting 4 rows, 4 columns, and ensuring that no two queens are on the same diagonal. But wait, because the board is 5x5, selecting 4 rows and 4 columns would leave some rows and columns unused. But in the toroidal case, the diagonals wrap around, so even if queens are on different rows and columns, they might still attack via the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering permutations. On a normal chessboard, the number of non-attacking arrangements is related to permutations where queens are in different rows and columns and not on the same diagonal. Here, the same applies but with the toroidal diagonals.\n\nLet me think. For a 5x5 board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens on a toroidal board is 5? I'm not sure, but maybe. For example, if it's possible to place 5 queens such that none attack each other, then that's the maximum. But in our case, we need 4 queens. So maybe the number is higher than the regular 5x5 non-toroidal case.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the toroidal case, certain configurations are allowed or disallowed. Let's try to find a way to compute the count.\n\nOne possible approach is inclusion-exclusion, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph problem where each node is a possible queen position, and edges connect nodes that attack each other. Then, the problem is to count the number of independent sets of size 4 in this graph. But even then, independent set counting is notoriously hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a known formula or result for the number of ways to place k non-attacking queens on a toroidal n x n board. I don't recall, but perhaps for small n and k, we can compute it manually.\n\nLet's try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, since the board is toroidal, the rows and columns are cyclic. So, for non-toroidal, placing 4 queens without sharing rows or columns would be 5x5x... Let's see, for the first queen, 25 choices. The second queen must be in a different row and column: so 16 choices (since 4 rows and 4 columns left). But that's without considering diagonals. However, even that would be 25*16*9*4 / 4! for permutations, but that's 25*16*9*4/(24) = (25*16*9*4)/24. But that's 25*(16/24)*(9*4) = not sure. Wait, but that's the count for 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 board where they only don't share rows or columns, ignoring diagonals. The actual number would be lower when considering diagonals. But since the problem is toroidal, diagonals also wrap, so even more restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the toroidal case, the problem can be transformed. For example, on a toroidal chessboard, each queen must be placed such that no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal (including wrap-around). Therefore, the problem is similar to placing queens on a chessboard where the positions are considered modulo 5 in both directions.\n\nSo, for queens not attacking each other, the usual conditions apply: each queen must be in a distinct row, column, and diagonal (both main and anti). Wait, but in the toroidal case, each diagonal is a loop. So, for two queens, the difference in rows and columns modulo 5 must not be equal (for same diagonal) or add up to 0 mod 5 (for the other diagonal). Wait, perhaps.\n\nLet me consider two queens at positions (r1,c1) and (r2,c2). On a toroidal board, they attack each other diagonally if (r1 - r2) \u2261 \u00b1(c1 - c2) mod 5. Because moving delta rows and delta columns, if delta rows = delta cols or delta rows = -delta cols modulo 5, then they're on the same diagonal (wrapping around).\n\nTherefore, the conditions for non-attacking queens on a toroidal board are:\n\n1. All in different rows (r1 \u2260 r2 \u2260 ... \u2260 r4)\n2. All in different columns (c1 \u2260 c2 \u2260 ... \u2260 c4)\n3. For any two queens, (ri - rj) \u2261 \u00b1 (ci - cj) mod 5 must not hold.\n\nAdditionally, since it's a 5x5 board, placing 4 queens, we have to select 4 distinct rows and 4 distinct columns. So, the queens form a permutation matrix of size 4x4, but on a 5x5 grid. Wait, no. Because it's 4 queens, each in a unique row and column. So, the arrangement is equivalent to selecting 4 rows, 4 columns, and a bijection between them (i.e., a permutation). But the permutations must also avoid the diagonal attack conditions.\n\nWait, but if we fix the rows and columns to be any 4 of the 5, then the number of possible permutations would be 4! for each selection of rows and columns. But we have to account for the diagonal constraints. However, because the board is toroidal, the diagonals wrap, so even if the rows and columns are not consecutive, the diagonal condition can still apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as a permutation of the columns for each row. For example, in the standard n-queen problem, solutions are permutations where no two queens are on the same diagonal. Here, with the toroidal condition, the diagonal check is modulo 5.\n\nBut since we're placing 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, maybe the problem is analogous to the 4-queen problem on a 5x5 torus. Let's consider that.\n\nLet me think of the standard approach for n-queens on a torus. For a toroidal board, solutions exist only when n is not divisible by 2 or 3, I think. Wait, I remember that for the n-queen problem on a torus, a necessary condition is that n is not divisible by 2 or 3. So, for n=5, which is not divisible by 2 or 3, there are solutions. Therefore, the maximum number of queens on a 5x5 torus is 5. But we are placing 4, so perhaps the count is higher than the number of possible 5-queen solutions.\n\nWait, but maybe the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is 5^2 * (5^2 - 5*3) * ... Hmm, no, that approach seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2, but that's 120, but that doesn't account for diagonals. Let's think again.\n\nEach queen must be placed in a distinct row and column. So, the first queen has 25 choices. The second queen has (5-1) rows and (5-1) columns, but also must not be on the same diagonal. Wait, but even that approach is complicated because the diagonals wrap around.\n\nAlternatively, consider that placing queens such that they form a permutation matrix of size 4x4, but on 5x5 grid. Wait, but permutation matrices have exactly one queen per row and column, but here we have 4 queens in 5 rows and 5 columns. So, perhaps the number of ways to choose 4 rows out of 5 and 4 columns out of 5, then arrange them in a permutation, avoiding the diagonal attacks.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 rows from 5 is C(5,4)=5, similarly for columns, C(5,4)=5. Then, for each selected 4 rows and 4 columns, the number of permutations is 4! = 24. But we have to subtract those permutations where any two queens are on the same diagonal (including wrap-around).\n\nSo total without considering diagonals would be 5 * 5 * 24 = 600. Then subtract the permutations where any two queens are attacking each other diagonally. But this inclusion-exclusion might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me check. For a standard n-queen problem on a torus, the number of solutions is known for certain n. For n=5, there are 10 solutions. But those are for 5 queens. However, we need 4 queens. So, perhaps each subset of 4 queens from a 5-queen solution would be valid. But wait, no. Because if you remove one queen from a 5-queen solution, the remaining 4 would still be non-attacking, yes. So if there are 10 solutions for 5 queens, each such solution gives 5 subsets of 4 queens. But then, how many unique 4-queen arrangements does that produce?\n\nWait, but each 5-queen solution has 5 different 4-queen subsets. However, these subsets might overlap with subsets from other 5-queen solutions. Therefore, the total number might be 10 * 5 = 50, but only if all subsets are unique. However, I'm not sure if this is the case, or if different 5-queen solutions share the same 4-queen subsets. If they do, then 50 would be an overcount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more arrangements of 4 queens that are not part of any 5-queen solution. So, this approach might not capture all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 4-queen arrangements is equal to the number of 5-queen solutions multiplied by 5, but I'm not certain. However, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that on a 5x5 toroidal board, each 5-queen solution can have 5 different 4-queen subsets. If there are 10 such solutions (as per some references I recall), then that would give 50. But maybe there are other 4-queen arrangements that aren't part of any 5-queen solution. So this approach might not account for all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of modular arithmetic. Since the board is toroidal, we can model rows and columns modulo 5. So, placing a queen at (i, j) implies that no other queen can be placed where (i', j') such that i' = i \u00b1 k mod 5 and j' = j \u00b1 k mod 5 for any k.\n\nWait, but for queens, the attack is along any diagonal, which is equivalent to saying that for two queens, the difference in rows and columns is congruent modulo 5. So, for two queens at (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), they attack diagonally if (r1 - r2) \u2261 \u00b1 (c1 - c2) mod 5.\n\nSo, when placing four queens, each must be in a distinct row and column, and for any pair, (ri - rj) \u2261 \u00b1 (ci - cj) mod 5 must not hold for any i \u2260 j.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a permutation problem where we need permutations of length 4 (since 4 queens) over 5 elements (rows and columns selected from 5), such that the permutation satisfies that for any two positions, the difference in rows and columns mod 5 isn't equal or negative equal.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that once we select 4 rows and 4 columns, the placement is a permutation of the columns for the selected rows. So, for each selection of 4 rows (say rows 1,2,3,4) and 4 columns (say columns a,b,c,d), the permutation of columns to rows must satisfy that for any two queens, (r_i - r_j) \u2261 \u00b1 (c_i - c_j) mod 5.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead of picking subsets of rows and columns, we can think of all possible permutations where queens are placed in distinct rows and columns, and then check the diagonal condition.\n\nFor a 5x5 board, the number of ways to place 4 queens with distinct rows and columns is 5P4 * 5P4 = (5*4*3*2) * (5*4*3*2) = 120 * 120 = 14,400. But that's obviously way too high because it doesn't consider diagonals, and the actual number must be much lower.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 5P4 is the number of ways to choose and arrange 4 rows out of 5, which is 5*4*3*2=120. Similarly for columns. But once rows are chosen, the columns are assigned via a permutation. So actually, the number of ways is C(5,4) * C(5,4) * 4! = 5*5*24=600. Because choosing 4 rows out of 5 (5 ways), 4 columns out of 5 (5 ways), and then permuting the columns for the rows (4! ways). So total 5*5*24=600.\n\nNow, from these 600 arrangements, we need to subtract those where any two queens are attacking diagonally.\n\nBut calculating that seems difficult. Maybe we can find the number of such permutations where no two queens are on the same diagonal (mod 5).\n\nAlternatively, for a permutation p of the columns, where p(i) is the column for row i (selected from the 4 rows and columns), the condition is that for any i \u2260 j, |i - j| \u2260 |p(i) - p(j)| mod 5 and |i - j| \u2260 -|p(i) - p(j)| mod 5.\n\nThis is similar to the standard n-queen problem but mod 5. So, perhaps the number of such permutations is known.\n\nAlternatively, since 5 is prime, maybe there's a pattern. For example, in the standard toroidal n-queen problem, one solution is to place queens at (i, (a*i + b) mod n) for i from 0 to n-1, where a and n are coprime. For n=5, which is prime, a can be 1,2,3,4. However, this gives solutions for n queens. But we need 4 queens. But perhaps this approach can help.\n\nAlternatively, since we're placing 4 queens, maybe we can use a similar linear approach but for a subset. For example, choose a subset of 4 rows and 4 columns, and use a linear function modulo 5 to place the queens. However, this might not work directly because 4 is not coprime to 5.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that to avoid diagonal attacks, the permutation must be such that the differences are not equal in the way mentioned. For a permutation of 4 elements, how many permutations satisfy that for all i < j, (j - i) \u2261 \u00b1 (p(j) - p(i)) mod 5 never holds.\n\nThis seems similar to derangements but more complex. Let's consider small permutations.\n\nSuppose we have 4 rows and 4 columns. Let's index them from 0 to 4 (mod 5). Let's select rows 0,1,2,3 and columns 0,1,2,3. Then, the permutation is a bijection from rows 0-3 to columns 0-3. We need to ensure that for any two rows i and j, (j - i) \u2260 \u00b1 (p(j) - p(i)) mod 5.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in rows modulo 5 must not equal the difference in columns modulo 5 or its negative.\n\nLet's take an example permutation. Suppose p(0)=0, p(1)=2, p(2)=4, p(3)=1.\n\nCheck the differences:\n\nBetween 0 and 1: row difference 1, column difference 2-0=2. 1 \u2260 \u00b12 mod 5. So okay.\n\nBetween 0 and 2: row difference 2, column difference 4-0=4. 2 \u2260 \u00b14 mod 5 (since 4 mod 5 is 4, -4 mod5 is 1). 2\u22604 and 2\u22601. Okay.\n\nBetween 0 and 3: row difference 3, column difference 1-0=1. 3\u2260\u00b11 mod5. Yes.\n\nBetween 1 and 2: row difference 1, column difference 4-2=2. 1\u2260\u00b12. Okay.\n\nBetween 1 and 3: row difference 2, column difference 1-2=-1\u22614 mod5. 2\u22604 and 2\u22601. Okay.\n\nBetween 2 and 3: row difference 1, column difference 1-4=-3\u22612 mod5. 1\u2260\u00b12. Okay.\n\nSo this permutation might be valid. But this is just one example. Finding all such permutations seems tedious.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of such permutations for a selected set of rows and columns might be equal to the number of derangements with additional constraints, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since on a 5x5 toroidal board, the maximum number of queens is 5, and each 5-queen solution has 5 possible ways to remove one queen, giving 5 subsets of 4 queens each, and if there are 10 solutions of 5 queens (as per some references), then the total would be 10*5=50. But this assumes that all subsets are unique and there are no other valid 4-queen arrangements that are not part of a 5-queen solution.\n\nBut this might not be the case. There could be configurations of 4 queens that cannot be extended to a 5-queen solution. Therefore, this approach might undercount.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for known results. Quick search in mind: the number of ways to place k non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board. For n=5 and k=4.\n\nI recall that on a toroidal board, the number of solutions for the n-queen problem (n queens) is known. For example, when n is not divisible by 2 or 3, solutions exist. For n=5, there are 10 solutions. But these are for 5 queens. Each solution would have C(5,4)=5 subsets of 4 queens, but these subsets might not all be unique. However, if each of the 10 solutions contributes 5 unique 4-queen arrangements, then 10*5=50 would be the total. However, this might not be correct if different 5-queen solutions share the same 4-queen subset. But I think it's unlikely because each 5-queen solution is a permutation where adding the fifth queen completes the set. So each 4-queen subset from a different 5-queen solution would differ by at least one queen.\n\nBut even if that's true, 50 is a possible answer. However, I'm not certain if there are other 4-queen arrangements not part of any 5-queen solution. Maybe there are none, as perhaps any 4 non-attacking queens can be extended to a 5th. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, perhaps after placing 4 queens, there is no safe position for the fifth queen. So, there might be 4-queen arrangements that cannot be extended, which would mean the total number is higher than 50.\n\nBut without knowing for sure, it's hard to proceed. Let's consider that each 5-queen solution gives 5 unique 4-queen subsets. If there are 10 such solutions, that gives 50. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the 5-queen solutions. Each solution is a permutation where queens are placed such that no two are attacking. For example, one solution is the standard modular arrangement: queen at (i, (2i) mod5) for i=0 to 4. Then, removing any one queen leaves 4 queens that are non-attacking. So each solution gives 5 subsets of 4 queens. If there are 10 such solutions, then 10*5=50. But this assumes no overlap, which I can't confirm.\n\nBut without more knowledge, I might have to assume that the answer is 50. However, wait, let's think again. If each 5-queen solution has 5 subsets, and there are 10 solutions, but each subset is counted multiple times if they appear in multiple solutions. For example, two different 5-queen solutions might share a common 4-queen subset. In that case, the total would be less than 50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 4-queen subset is part of exactly two 5-queen solutions. Then, the total number would be (10*5)/2=25. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, I found a reference (in my mind) that the number of 5-queen solutions on a toroidal 5x5 board is 10, each giving 5 subsets of 4 queens, but each 4-queen subset is unique. So 50 total. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are 100 ways. Wait, let's think differently. The number of 4-queen arrangements where they don't attack each other on a toroidal 5x5 board. Each queen must be in a distinct row and column. So, it's a permutation of 4 elements in 5 rows and 5 columns. The count is 5*5*4! = 600. From these, we need to subtract those permutations where any two queens are on the same diagonal.\n\nBut how many such permutations are there?\n\nCalculating that directly seems difficult, but perhaps there's a combinatorial formula.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible way to choose 4 rows and 4 columns, the number of valid permutations (non-attacking) is the number of 4x4 permutations where no two elements are on the same diagonal (mod5). This is akin to the 4-queen problem on a 4x4 toroidal board, but with positions mapped to the 5x5 grid.\n\nWait, but the 4x4 toroidal board's solutions would have different constraints. Wait, perhaps not. The problem is that the diagonals wrap around modulo 5, not modulo 4. So the usual 4-queen solutions on a 4x4 board might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, for each selected set of 4 rows (say rows 0,1,2,3) and 4 columns (0,1,2,3), we need to count the number of permutations of columns to rows such that no two queens are on the same diagonal (mod5).\n\nLet's take a small example. Suppose rows are 0,1,2,3 and columns are 0,1,2,3. We need to arrange queens such that for any two queens at (i, p(i)) and (j, p(j)), (i - j) \u2261 \u00b1 (p(i) - p(j)) mod5.\n\nSo, the difference in rows (i-j) mod5 should not be equal to the difference in columns (p(i)-p(j)) mod5 or its negative.\n\nLet's take an example permutation: 0\u21920, 1\u21921, 2\u21922, 3\u21923. This is the identity permutation. Check:\n\nFor i=0 and j=1: 1-0=1, column difference 1-0=1. So 1\u22611 mod5. So they attack. Therefore, this permutation is invalid.\n\nAnother permutation: 0\u21921, 1\u21923, 2\u21920, 3\u21922.\n\nCheck pairs:\n\n0 and 1: row diff 1, column diff 3-1=2. 1\u2260\u00b12 mod5.\n\n0 and 2: row diff 2, column diff 0-1= -1\u22614. 2\u22604 or 1.\n\n0 and 3: row diff 3, column diff 2-1=1. 3\u22601 or 4.\n\n1 and 2: row diff 1, column diff 0-3= -3\u22612. 1\u22602 or 3.\n\n1 and 3: row diff 2, column diff 2-3= -1\u22614. 2\u22604 or 1.\n\n2 and 3: row diff 1, column diff 2-0=2. 1\u22602 or 3.\n\nSo this permutation is valid.\n\nSo, this permutation is acceptable. Thus, the number of valid permutations depends on avoiding certain differences.\n\nBut how many such permutations are there for each selection of rows and columns?\n\nThis seems like a complex combinatorial problem. Perhaps the number of such permutations is 0 or a known value for each 4x4 subset. But without more information, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 4x4 subset has 2 valid permutations, leading to 5*5*2=50. But that's a guess. Alternatively, if each 4x4 grid has 2 solutions, then total is 5*5*2=50. This aligns with the earlier thought of 50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula. For a toroidal n x n board, the number of ways to place k non-attacking queens might be n \u00d7 (n - 3) \u00d7 ... but I don't recall such a formula.\n\nAlternatively, given that I'm stuck, I'll hazard a guess based on the earlier reasoning: if there are 10 solutions for 5 queens, each giving 5 subsets, total 50. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 100, as 5x5x4=100, but that's not based on anything concrete.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each queen must be in a different row and column, and no two queens are on the same diagonal. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, selecting 4 rows and 4 columns can be done in 5C4 * 5C4 = 5*5=25 ways. For each such selection, the number of valid permutations is the number of 4-permutations avoiding the diagonal conflicts.\n\nSuppose that for each 4x4 grid, there are 2 valid permutations. Then total is 25*2=50. That would give 50 as the answer.\n\nBut where does the 2 come from? For a 4x4 toroidal chessboard, the number of solutions for 4 queens is 0 (since 4 is divisible by 2), but since we're embedding it in a 5x5 grid with mod5, maybe there are solutions. Alternatively, maybe each 4x4 subset has 2 valid permutations when considered in mod5.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible answer is 50, based on the 10 solutions for 5 queens, each contributing 5 subsets. But I'm not at all confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 100.\n\nAnother angle: The number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 regular (non-toroidal) board is known to be 10 (source: some references), but I'm not sure. If that's the case, then for the toroidal case, considering more restrictions, the number might be higher or lower. But I don't recall the exact count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 0, but that doesn't make sense because surely you can place 4 queens without attacking each other even on a toroidal board.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll go with 50 as the answer, but with low confidence.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: To determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard, we must ensure no two queens share a row, column, or diagonal (including wrap-around). On a toroidal board, diagonal attacks wrap modulo 5. For a 5x5 toroidal board, there are 10 known solutions for 5 non-attacking queens. Each 5-queen solution can be reduced by removing one queen, yielding 5 valid 4-queen arrangements per solution. Assuming no overlap between these subsets, the total is \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\). This assumes all 4-queen configurations are derived from 5-queen solutions, though some independent configurations might exist. However, the most plausible count based on standard toroidal queen solutions is 50.\n\nAnswer: 50  \nConfidence: 50%",

On a toroidal board, diagonal attacks wrap modulo 5. For a 5x5 toroidal board, there are 10 known solutions for 5 non-attacking queens. Each 5-queen solution can be reduced by removing one queen, yielding 5 valid 4-queen arrangements per solution. Assuming no overlap between these subsets, the total is \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\). This assumes all 4-queen configurations are derived from 5-queen solutions, though some independent configurations might exist. However, the most plausible count based on standard toroidal queen solutions is 50.",

  "thinking": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. A toroidal chessboard means that the edges wrap around, right? So if a queen is on the top row, she can attack the bottom row, and similarly for the columns. That complicates things because queens can attack across the edges.\n\nFirst, I remember that on a regular chessboard (non-toroidal), the number of ways to place n non-attacking queens is a classic problem. But here, the toroidal condition must change things. For a toroidal board, queens also can't attack along the diagonals that wrap around. Wait, maybe the problem requires that queens don't attack each other in any direction, including when the board wraps around. So, in addition to the usual rows, columns, and diagonals, we have to consider the toroidal diagonals as well.\n\nLet me recall that on a toroidal (modular) chessboard, one solution for n queens where n is not 1 or 5 mod 6 exists. Wait, but 5x5 is a specific case. Wait, but for n=5, the modular board might have some specific solutions. Wait, but here we are not placing 5 queens but 4. So maybe the standard n-queen solutions aren't directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this by considering that on a toroidal board, each queen must not share any row, column, or diagonal (including the ones that wrap). So for each queen placed, it blocks certain positions. But since the board is toroidal, each row and column has exactly 5 positions, and each diagonal (both normal and wrap-around) would also have 5 positions.\n\nBut how do you count the arrangements where 4 queens don't attack each other? Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, on a 5x5 board, each queen attacks in her row, column, and two diagonals. Because it's toroidal, the rows and columns are cyclic. So diagonals wrap around. For example, moving up-right from (1,5) would wrap to (2,1), etc. So, each diagonal direction (like northeast) has 5 diagonals, each of length 5. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: On a toroidal grid, diagonals become cycles. For example, a diagonal direction (1,1) would wrap around, so the diagonal would consist of (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), then back to (1,1). Similarly, a diagonal in the other direction (like 1,5 to 5,1) would also form a cycle.\n\nSo, on a 5x5 toroidal board, each square is part of two diagonal cycles. So, when placing a queen, she attacks all squares in her row, column, and both diagonals. So, when placing queens, each new queen cannot share a row, column, or either diagonal with any existing queen.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to placing 4 queens such that no two share a row, column, or diagonal. Since the board is 5x5, this is similar to the n-queens problem but on a torus and with n=4 on a 5x5 board. Wait, but the n-queens problem on a torus usually refers to placing n queens on an n x n board. Here, n=4 on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as selecting 4 rows, 4 columns, and ensuring that no two queens are on the same diagonal. But wait, because the board is 5x5, selecting 4 rows and 4 columns would leave some rows and columns unused. But in the toroidal case, the diagonals wrap around, so even if queens are on different rows and columns, they might still attack via the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering permutations. On a normal chessboard, the number of non-attacking arrangements is related to permutations where queens are in different rows and columns and not on the same diagonal. Here, the same applies but with the toroidal diagonals.\n\nLet me think. For a 5x5 board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens on a toroidal board is 5? I'm not sure, but maybe. For example, if it's possible to place 5 queens such that none attack each other, then that's the maximum. But in our case, we need 4 queens. So maybe the number is higher than the regular 5x5 non-toroidal case.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the toroidal case, certain configurations are allowed or disallowed. Let's try to find a way to compute the count.\n\nOne possible approach is inclusion-exclusion, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph problem where each node is a possible queen position, and edges connect nodes that attack each other. Then, the problem is to count the number of independent sets of size 4 in this graph. But even then, independent set counting is notoriously hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a known formula or result for the number of ways to place k non-attacking queens on a toroidal n x n board. I don't recall, but perhaps for small n and k, we can compute it manually.\n\nLet's try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, since the board is toroidal, the rows and columns are cyclic. So, for non-toroidal, placing 4 queens without sharing rows or columns would be 5x5x... Let's see, for the first queen, 25 choices. The second queen must be in a different row and column: so 16 choices (since 4 rows and 4 columns left). But that's without considering diagonals. However, even that would be 25*16*9*4 / 4! for permutations, but that's 25*16*9*4/(24) = (25*16*9*4)/24. But that's 25*(16/24)*(9*4) = not sure. Wait, but that's the count for 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 board where they only don't share rows or columns, ignoring diagonals. The actual number would be lower when considering diagonals. But since the problem is toroidal, diagonals also wrap, so even more restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the toroidal case, the problem can be transformed. For example, on a toroidal chessboard, each queen must be placed such that no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal (including wrap-around). Therefore, the problem is similar to placing queens on a chessboard where the positions are considered modulo 5 in both directions.\n\nSo, for queens not attacking each other, the usual conditions apply: each queen must be in a distinct row, column, and diagonal (both main and anti). Wait, but in the toroidal case, each diagonal is a loop. So, for two queens, the difference in rows and columns modulo 5 must not be equal (for same diagonal) or add up to 0 mod 5 (for the other diagonal). Wait, perhaps.\n\nLet me consider two queens at positions (r1,c1) and (r2,c2). On a toroidal board, they attack each other diagonally if (r1 - r2) \u2261 \u00b1(c1 - c2) mod 5. Because moving delta rows and delta columns, if delta rows = delta cols or delta rows = -delta cols modulo 5, then they're on the same diagonal (wrapping around).\n\nTherefore, the conditions for non-attacking queens on a toroidal board are:\n\n1. All in different rows (r1 \u2260 r2 \u2260 ... \u2260 r4)\n2. All in different columns (c1 \u2260 c2 \u2260 ... \u2260 c4)\n3. For any two queens, (ri - rj) \u2261 \u00b1 (ci - cj) mod 5 must not hold.\n\nAdditionally, since it's a 5x5 board, placing 4 queens, we have to select 4 distinct rows and 4 distinct columns. So, the queens form a permutation matrix of size 4x4, but on a 5x5 grid. Wait, no. Because it's 4 queens, each in a unique row and column. So, the arrangement is equivalent to selecting 4 rows, 4 columns, and a bijection between them (i.e., a permutation). But the permutations must also avoid the diagonal attack conditions.\n\nWait, but if we fix the rows and columns to be any 4 of the 5, then the number of possible permutations would be 4! for each selection of rows and columns. But we have to account for the diagonal constraints. However, because the board is toroidal, the diagonals wrap, so even if the rows and columns are not consecutive, the diagonal condition can still apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as a permutation of the columns for each row. For example, in the standard n-queen problem, solutions are permutations where no two queens are on the same diagonal. Here, with the toroidal condition, the diagonal check is modulo 5.\n\nBut since we're placing 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, maybe the problem is analogous to the 4-queen problem on a 5x5 torus. Let's consider that.\n\nLet me think of the standard approach for n-queens on a torus. For a toroidal board, solutions exist only when n is not divisible by 2 or 3, I think. Wait, I remember that for the n-queen problem on a torus, a necessary condition is that n is not divisible by 2 or 3. So, for n=5, which is not divisible by 2 or 3, there are solutions. Therefore, the maximum number of queens on a 5x5 torus is 5. But we are placing 4, so perhaps the count is higher than the number of possible 5-queen solutions.\n\nWait, but maybe the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is 5^2 * (5^2 - 5*3) * ... Hmm, no, that approach seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2, but that's 120, but that doesn't account for diagonals. Let's think again.\n\nEach queen must be placed in a distinct row and column. So, the first queen has 25 choices. The second queen has (5-1) rows and (5-1) columns, but also must not be on the same diagonal. Wait, but even that approach is complicated because the diagonals wrap around.\n\nAlternatively, consider that placing queens such that they form a permutation matrix of size 4x4, but on 5x5 grid. Wait, but permutation matrices have exactly one queen per row and column, but here we have 4 queens in 5 rows and 5 columns. So, perhaps the number of ways to choose 4 rows out of 5 and 4 columns out of 5, then arrange them in a permutation, avoiding the diagonal attacks.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 rows from 5 is C(5,4)=5, similarly for columns, C(5,4)=5. Then, for each selected 4 rows and 4 columns, the number of permutations is 4! = 24. But we have to subtract those permutations where any two queens are on the same diagonal (including wrap-around).\n\nSo total without considering diagonals would be 5 * 5 * 24 = 600. Then subtract the permutations where any two queens are attacking each other diagonally. But this inclusion-exclusion might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me check. For a standard n-queen problem on a torus, the number of solutions is known for certain n. For n=5, there are 10 solutions. But those are for 5 queens. However, we need 4 queens. So, perhaps each subset of 4 queens from a 5-queen solution would be valid. But wait, no. Because if you remove one queen from a 5-queen solution, the remaining 4 would still be non-attacking, yes. So if there are 10 solutions for 5 queens, each such solution gives 5 subsets of 4 queens. But then, how many unique 4-queen arrangements does that produce?\n\nWait, but each 5-queen solution has 5 different 4-queen subsets. However, these subsets might overlap with subsets from other 5-queen solutions. Therefore, the total number might be 10 * 5 = 50, but only if all subsets are unique. However, I'm not sure if this is the case, or if different 5-queen solutions share the same 4-queen subsets. If they do, then 50 would be an overcount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more arrangements of 4 queens that are not part of any 5-queen solution. So, this approach might not capture all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 4-queen arrangements is equal to the number of 5-queen solutions multiplied by 5, but I'm not certain. However, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that on a 5x5 toroidal board, each 5-queen solution can have 5 different 4-queen subsets. If there are 10 such solutions (as per some references I recall), then that would give 50. But maybe there are other 4-queen arrangements that aren't part of any 5-queen solution. So this approach might not account for all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of modular arithmetic. Since the board is toroidal, we can model rows and columns modulo 5. So, placing a queen at (i, j) implies that no other queen can be placed where (i', j') such that i' = i \u00b1 k mod 5 and j' = j \u00b1 k mod 5 for any k.\n\nWait, but for queens, the attack is along any diagonal, which is equivalent to saying that for two queens, the difference in rows and columns is congruent modulo 5. So, for two queens at (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), they attack diagonally if (r1 - r2) \u2261 \u00b1 (c1 - c2) mod 5.\n\nSo, when placing four queens, each must be in a distinct row and column, and for any pair, (ri - rj) \u2261 \u00b1 (ci - cj) mod 5 must not hold for any i \u2260 j.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a permutation problem where we need permutations of length 4 (since 4 queens) over 5 elements (rows and columns selected from 5), such that the permutation satisfies that for any two positions, the difference in rows and columns mod 5 isn't equal or negative equal.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that once we select 4 rows and 4 columns, the placement is a permutation of the columns for the selected rows. So, for each selection of 4 rows (say rows 1,2,3,4) and 4 columns (say columns a,b,c,d), the permutation of columns to rows must satisfy that for any two queens, (r_i - r_j) \u2261 \u00b1 (c_i - c_j) mod 5.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead of picking subsets of rows and columns, we can think of all possible permutations where queens are placed in distinct rows and columns, and then check the diagonal condition.\n\nFor a 5x5 board, the number of ways to place 4 queens with distinct rows and columns is 5P4 * 5P4 = (5*4*3*2) * (5*4*3*2) = 120 * 120 = 14,400. But that's obviously way too high because it doesn't consider diagonals, and the actual number must be much lower.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 5P4 is the number of ways to choose and arrange 4 rows out of 5, which is 5*4*3*2=120. Similarly for columns. But once rows are chosen, the columns are assigned via a permutation. So actually, the number of ways is C(5,4) * C(5,4) * 4! = 5*5*24=600. Because choosing 4 rows out of 5 (5 ways), 4 columns out of 5 (5 ways), and then permuting the columns for the rows (4! ways). So total 5*5*24=600.\n\nNow, from these 600 arrangements, we need to subtract those where any two queens are attacking diagonally.\n\nBut calculating that seems difficult. Maybe we can find the number of such permutations where no two queens are on the same diagonal (mod 5).\n\nAlternatively, for a permutation p of the columns, where p(i) is the column for row i (selected from the 4 rows and columns), the condition is that for any i \u2260 j, |i - j| \u2260 |p(i) - p(j)| mod 5 and |i - j| \u2260 -|p(i) - p(j)| mod 5.\n\nThis is similar to the standard n-queen problem but mod 5. So, perhaps the number of such permutations is known.\n\nAlternatively, since 5 is prime, maybe there's a pattern. For example, in the standard toroidal n-queen problem, one solution is to place queens at (i, (a*i + b) mod n) for i from 0 to n-1, where a and n are coprime. For n=5, which is prime, a can be 1,2,3,4. However, this gives solutions for n queens. But we need 4 queens. But perhaps this approach can help.\n\nAlternatively, since we're placing 4 queens, maybe we can use a similar linear approach but for a subset. For example, choose a subset of 4 rows and 4 columns, and use a linear function modulo 5 to place the queens. However, this might not work directly because 4 is not coprime to 5.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that to avoid diagonal attacks, the permutation must be such that the differences are not equal in the way mentioned. For a permutation of 4 elements, how many permutations satisfy that for all i < j, (j - i) \u2261 \u00b1 (p(j) - p(i)) mod 5 never holds.\n\nThis seems similar to derangements but more complex. Let's consider small permutations.\n\nSuppose we have 4 rows and 4 columns. Let's index them from 0 to 4 (mod 5). Let's select rows 0,1,2,3 and columns 0,1,2,3. Then, the permutation is a bijection from rows 0-3 to columns 0-3. We need to ensure that for any two rows i and j, (j - i) \u2260 \u00b1 (p(j) - p(i)) mod 5.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in rows modulo 5 must not equal the difference in columns modulo 5 or its negative.\n\nLet's take an example permutation. Suppose p(0)=0, p(1)=2, p(2)=4, p(3)=1.\n\nCheck the differences:\n\nBetween 0 and 1: row difference 1, column difference 2-0=2. 1 \u2260 \u00b12 mod 5. So okay.\n\nBetween 0 and 2: row difference 2, column difference 4-0=4. 2 \u2260 \u00b14 mod 5 (since 4 mod 5 is 4, -4 mod5 is 1). 2\u22604 and 2\u22601. Okay.\n\nBetween 0 and 3: row difference 3, column difference 1-0=1. 3\u2260\u00b11 mod5. Yes.\n\nBetween 1 and 2: row difference 1, column difference 4-2=2. 1\u2260\u00b12. Okay.\n\nBetween 1 and 3: row difference 2, column difference 1-2=-1\u22614 mod5. 2\u22604 and 2\u22601. Okay.\n\nBetween 2 and 3: row difference 1, column difference 1-4=-3\u22612 mod5. 1\u2260\u00b12. Okay.\n\nSo this permutation might be valid. But this is just one example. Finding all such permutations seems tedious.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of such permutations for a selected set of rows and columns might be equal to the number of derangements with additional constraints, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since on a 5x5 toroidal board, the maximum number of queens is 5, and each 5-queen solution has 5 possible ways to remove one queen, giving 5 subsets of 4 queens each, and if there are 10 solutions of 5 queens (as per some references), then the total would be 10*5=50. But this assumes that all subsets are unique and there are no other valid 4-queen arrangements that are not part of a 5-queen solution.\n\nBut this might not be the case. There could be configurations of 4 queens that cannot be extended to a 5-queen solution. Therefore, this approach might undercount.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for known results. Quick search in mind: the number of ways to place k non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board. For n=5 and k=4.\n\nI recall that on a toroidal board, the number of solutions for the n-queen problem (n queens) is known. For example, when n is not divisible by 2 or 3, solutions exist. For n=5, there are 10 solutions. But these are for 5 queens. Each solution would have C(5,4)=5 subsets of 4 queens, but these subsets might not all be unique. However, if each of the 10 solutions contributes 5 unique 4-queen arrangements, then 10*5=50 would be the total. However, this might not be correct if different 5-queen solutions share the same 4-queen subset. But I think it's unlikely because each 5-queen solution is a permutation where adding the fifth queen completes the set. So each 4-queen subset from a different 5-queen solution would differ by at least one queen.\n\nBut even if that's true, 50 is a possible answer. However, I'm not certain if there are other 4-queen arrangements not part of any 5-queen solution. Maybe there are none, as perhaps any 4 non-attacking queens can be extended to a 5th. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, perhaps after placing 4 queens, there is no safe position for the fifth queen. So, there might be 4-queen arrangements that cannot be extended, which would mean the total number is higher than 50.\n\nBut without knowing for sure, it's hard to proceed. Let's consider that each 5-queen solution gives 5 unique 4-queen subsets. If there are 10 such solutions, that gives 50. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the 5-queen solutions. Each solution is a permutation where queens are placed such that no two are attacking. For example, one solution is the standard modular arrangement: queen at (i, (2i) mod5) for i=0 to 4. Then, removing any one queen leaves 4 queens that are non-attacking. So each solution gives 5 subsets of 4 queens. If there are 10 such solutions, then 10*5=50. But this assumes no overlap, which I can't confirm.\n\nBut without more knowledge, I might have to assume that the answer is 50. However, wait, let's think again. If each 5-queen solution has 5 subsets, and there are 10 solutions, but each subset is counted multiple times if they appear in multiple solutions. For example, two different 5-queen solutions might share a common 4-queen subset. In that case, the total would be less than 50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 4-queen subset is part of exactly two 5-queen solutions. Then, the total number would be (10*5)/2=25. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, I found a reference (in my mind) that the number of 5-queen solutions on a toroidal 5x5 board is 10, each giving 5 subsets of 4 queens, but each 4-queen subset is unique. So 50 total. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are 100 ways. Wait, let's think differently. The number of 4-queen arrangements where they don't attack each other on a toroidal 5x5 board. Each queen must be in a distinct row and column. So, it's a permutation of 4 elements in 5 rows and 5 columns. The count is 5*5*4! = 600. From these, we need to subtract those permutations where any two queens are on the same diagonal.\n\nBut how many such permutations are there?\n\nCalculating that directly seems difficult, but perhaps there's a combinatorial formula.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible way to choose 4 rows and 4 columns, the number of valid permutations (non-attacking) is the number of 4x4 permutations where no two elements are on the same diagonal (mod5). This is akin to the 4-queen problem on a 4x4 toroidal board, but with positions mapped to the 5x5 grid.\n\nWait, but the 4x4 toroidal board's solutions would have different constraints. Wait, perhaps not. The problem is that the diagonals wrap around modulo 5, not modulo 4. So the usual 4-queen solutions on a 4x4 board might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, for each selected set of 4 rows (say rows 0,1,2,3) and 4 columns (0,1,2,3), we need to count the number of permutations of columns to rows such that no two queens are on the same diagonal (mod5).\n\nLet's take a small example. Suppose rows are 0,1,2,3 and columns are 0,1,2,3. We need to arrange queens such that for any two queens at (i, p(i)) and (j, p(j)), (i - j) \u2261 \u00b1 (p(i) - p(j)) mod5.\n\nSo, the difference in rows (i-j) mod5 should not be equal to the difference in columns (p(i)-p(j)) mod5 or its negative.\n\nLet's take an example permutation: 0\u21920, 1\u21921, 2\u21922, 3\u21923. This is the identity permutation. Check:\n\nFor i=0 and j=1: 1-0=1, column difference 1-0=1. So 1\u22611 mod5. So they attack. Therefore, this permutation is invalid.\n\nAnother permutation: 0\u21921, 1\u21923, 2\u21920, 3\u21922.\n\nCheck pairs:\n\n0 and 1: row diff 1, column diff 3-1=2. 1\u2260\u00b12 mod5.\n\n0 and 2: row diff 2, column diff 0-1= -1\u22614. 2\u22604 or 1.\n\n0 and 3: row diff 3, column diff 2-1=1. 3\u22601 or 4.\n\n1 and 2: row diff 1, column diff 0-3= -3\u22612. 1\u22602 or 3.\n\n1 and 3: row diff 2, column diff 2-3= -1\u22614. 2\u22604 or 1.\n\n2 and 3: row diff 1, column diff 2-0=2. 1\u22602 or 3.\n\nSo this permutation is valid.\n\nSo, this permutation is acceptable. Thus, the number of valid permutations depends on avoiding certain differences.\n\nBut how many such permutations are there for each selection of rows and columns?\n\nThis seems like a complex combinatorial problem. Perhaps the number of such permutations is 0 or a known value for each 4x4 subset. But without more information, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 4x4 subset has 2 valid permutations, leading to 5*5*2=50. But that's a guess. Alternatively, if each 4x4 grid has 2 solutions, then total is 5*5*2=50. This aligns with the earlier thought of 50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula. For a toroidal n x n board, the number of ways to place k non-attacking queens might be n \u00d7 (n - 3) \u00d7 ... but I don't recall such a formula.\n\nAlternatively, given that I'm stuck, I'll hazard a guess based on the earlier reasoning: if there are 10 solutions for 5 queens, each giving 5 subsets, total 50. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 100, as 5x5x4=100, but that's not based on anything concrete.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each queen must be in a different row and column, and no two queens are on the same diagonal. Since there are 5 rows and 5 columns, selecting 4 rows and 4 columns can be done in 5C4 * 5C4 = 5*5=25 ways. For each such selection, the number of valid permutations is the number of 4-permutations avoiding the diagonal conflicts.\n\nSuppose that for each 4x4 grid, there are 2 valid permutations. Then total is 25*2=50. That would give 50 as the answer.\n\nBut where does the 2 come from? For a 4x4 toroidal chessboard, the number of solutions for 4 queens is 0 (since 4 is divisible by 2), but since we're embedding it in a 5x5 grid with mod5, maybe there are solutions. Alternatively, maybe each 4x4 subset has 2 valid permutations when considered in mod5.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible answer is 50, based on the 10 solutions for 5 queens, each contributing 5 subsets. But I'm not at all confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 100.\n\nAnother angle: The number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 regular (non-toroidal) board is known to be 10 (source: some references), but I'm not sure. If that's the case, then for the toroidal case, considering more restrictions, the number might be higher or lower. But I don't recall the exact count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 0, but that doesn't make sense because surely you can place 4 queens without attacking each other even on a toroidal board.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll go with 50 as the answer, but with low confidence.",
