  "question": "What is the smallest number of composants (not components) an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have. Hmm, first, let me make sure I understand the terms here. \n\nAn indecomposable continuum is a continuum that cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. Right, so it's a kind of connected compact space that's not made up of two smaller continua. Now, composants... Composants are a concept related to continua. From what I remember, in a decomposable continuum, each point belongs to a composant, which is the union of all proper subcontinua containing that point. But in an indecomposable continuum, every composant is dense, and the continuum is the union of uncountably many pairwise disjoint composants.\n\nWait, the question is asking about the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum (not necessarily metric) can have. So, does it have to be non-metric? The question says \"not necessarily metric\", so maybe the answer differs in non-metric vs. metric cases. But I need to recall what's known here.\n\nIn the metric case, I remember that indecomposable metric continua have uncountably many composants. For example, the classic example is the Knaster bucket handle continuum, which has uncountably many composants. But the question is about the non-metric case. Maybe in non-metric continua, you can have different behaviors? \n\nI recall that in ZFC, for metric continua, indecomposable ones have exactly c (continuum many) composants. But if we drop metrizability, could there be an indecomposable continuum with fewer composants? Like maybe even just three? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the composants in an indecomposable continuum are pairwise disjoint, right? So the continuum is the union of its composants. Each composant is a dense subset. For a decomposable continuum, each composant is the union of all proper subcontinua containing a point. But in an indecomposable one, there are no proper subcontinua containing more than one point? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Even in an indecomposable continuum, there are proper subcontinua, but you can't write the whole space as the union of two of them. \n\nBut the composant of a point x in a continuum is the set of all points y such that there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both x and y. In an indecomposable continuum, each composant is a proper subset. So the continuum must be partitioned into multiple composants. \n\nNow, for the number of composants. In the metric case, as I said, it's uncountable. For example, the pseudo-arc is a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum, and it has uncountably many composants. But maybe in non-metric continua, you can have different cardinalities. \n\nWait, I think there's a result that in any indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is either one or uncountable. Wait, but if it's indecomposable, can it have only one composant? No, because if all points are in the same composant, that would mean that for any two points x and y, there's a proper subcontinuum containing both. If that's true for all pairs, then maybe the whole continuum could be written as the union of two such subcontinua? Hmm, maybe that leads to a contradiction. \n\nWait, here's a theorem: An indecomposable continuum has either one composant or uncountably many. But wait, if it's indecomposable, can it have one composant? Let me check. Suppose there's only one composant. Then every two points lie in a proper subcontinuum. So take any proper subcontinuum K. Then the union of all proper subcontinua containing a point x would be the entire continuum. But since the continuum is indecomposable, it can't be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. But if there's only one composant, then every point is in the same composant, meaning that for any two points, there's a proper subcontinuum containing both. Then perhaps by some argument, you can cover the space with two such subcontinua, contradicting indecomposability. Therefore, an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. \n\nBut how many? If it's not one, then maybe infinitely many. But can it be three? Wait, in the non-metric case, maybe the number can be finite? But I'm not sure. Let's think: suppose there's an indecomposable continuum with two composants. Then the space is the union of two composants, each of which is dense. But composants are pairwise disjoint. So the space is partitioned into two disjoint dense subsets. But is that possible? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number is three. Wait, I recall from some examples that there's a theorem stating that every hereditarily indecomposable continuum has either one or uncountably many composants, but that's in the metric case. Wait, but maybe in non-metric continua, there exists an indecomposable continuum with exactly three composants? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is three. Wait, there's a classic result by Kuratowski or someone else that in non-metric continua, you can have indecomposable continua with exactly three composants. \n\nWait, perhaps in the non-metric case, the answer is three. Let me check. Suppose that the continuum is constructed in such a way that it's the union of three composants. Each composant is dense, and pairwise disjoint. Then such a continuum would be indecomposable. I think such examples exist in non-metric continua. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number is two? But if there are two composants, then the continuum is the union of two composants, which are dense and disjoint. Then, if each composant is a union of proper subcontinua, maybe their union would give the whole space. But if the space is indecomposable, then it cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. However, composants are not necessarily subcontinua themselves. Composants are unions of subcontinua, but they might not be closed. In fact, composants are dense and proper subsets. \n\nSo if the space has two composants, each composant is dense and their union is the entire space. But since composants are disjoint, it's like a partition into two dense subsets. But would that lead to the space being decomposable? \n\nSuppose we have two composants C1 and C2. If we take a point x1 in C1 and x2 in C2. Then there exists a proper subcontinuum K1 containing x1 and some other points of C1, and similarly K2 for C2. But can we cover the space with K1 and K2? Probably not, but maybe the composants are such that their subcontinua can't cover the whole space. \n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Let me look up some references in my mind. I recall that in 1948, C. E. Burgess proved that a metric indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants. But for non-metric continua, the situation is different. There's an example by P. Minc of a non-metric indecomposable continuum with exactly three composants. So the minimal number is three. Therefore, the answer is three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two? If two composants, but I think that's impossible. Because if you have two composants, then the composants would have to be mutually dense. But how would that prevent the space from being decomposable? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is three. So the minimal number is three. Hence, the answer is three, and the confidence is around 80% because I'm not entirely sure but remember some examples in non-metric continua.\n",
