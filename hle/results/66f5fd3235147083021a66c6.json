  "question": "Consider the integral $I(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9) = \\int_{[0, 1]^2} e^{2\\pi i (a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3)} dxdy$. What is the largest $p$ such that the function $I$ is not in $L^p (\\mathbb{R}^9)$?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about an integral I(a1,...,a9) which is a complex exponential integrated over the unit square [0,1]^2. The exponents involve a combination of linear, quadratic, and cubic terms in x and y. The question is asking for the largest p such that I is not in L^p of R^9. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that being in L^p means that the integral of |I|^p over all the variables a1 to a9 is finite. So we need to find when this integral diverges. The largest p where it's not in L^p would be the threshold where for any p larger than this value, the integral converges, but for p equal to or less than this value, it diverges.\n\nNow, the integral I is similar to an oscillatory integral. The integral of e^{i(terms)} over x and y. The behavior of such integrals often relates to stationary phase methods or decay estimates. Maybe the key is to determine the decay rate of |I(a)| as |a| goes to infinity. Because if |I(a)| decays like |a|^{-s}, then the L^p norm would involve integrating |a|^{-s p}, so convergence would depend on s p > 9 (since we're integrating over R^9). Wait, the dimension is 9, right?\n\nSo if |I(a)| ~ |a|^{-k} for some k, then the integral of |I(a)|^p over R^9 would be like the integral of |a|^{-k p} da. In polar coordinates, the volume element in R^9 is proportional to r^8 dr. So convergence at infinity would require that -k p + 8 < -1, so that the integral of r^{8 - k p} dr from some R to infinity converges. So 8 - k p < -1 => k p > 9 => p > 9/k. Therefore, the critical p is 9/k. So if we can find k such that |I(a)| ~ |a|^{-k} as |a| \u2192 \u221e, then the critical p is 9/k. The largest p where L^p is not included is 9/k. But I need to find the k here.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the decay rate of the oscillatory integral I(a). For oscillatory integrals of the form \u222b e^{i \u03c6(x)} dx, the decay rate depends on the number of non-degenerate critical points of the phase function \u03c6. If the phase has no critical points, the integral decays rapidly (faster than any polynomial). If there are critical points, the decay is determined by the type of those critical points. For example, in one dimension, if the phase has a non-degenerate critical point (i.e., the second derivative is non-zero), the integral decays like |a|^{-1/2} by the method of stationary phase. In higher dimensions, it's more complicated.\n\nIn this case, the phase is a cubic polynomial in x and y. The coefficients a1 to a9 multiply various monomials. The integral is over [0,1]^2. The decay of such integrals is studied in the context of oscillatory integrals with polynomial phases. The general theory here is that the decay rate is determined by the Newton polygon or the Newton polyhedron associated with the phase function. But maybe an easier approach is to consider the type of singularities the phase function can have.\n\nAlternatively, there's a result by Varchenko or others that relates the decay rate of oscillatory integrals with analytic phases to the distance to the Newton polyhedron. But since this is a cubic polynomial, maybe it's simpler. Let's think about the possible critical points of the phase function \u03c6(x,y) = a1 x + a2 y + a3 x\u00b2 + a4 xy + a5 y\u00b2 + a6 x\u00b3 + a7 x\u00b2 y + a8 x y\u00b2 + a9 y\u00b3.\n\nThe integral is \u222b e^{2\u03c0i \u03c6(x,y)} dx dy. The decay of I(a) as |a| \u2192 \u221e (assuming some scaling) would depend on the highest degree terms. The leading terms are the cubic ones (x\u00b3, x\u00b2 y, x y\u00b2, y\u00b3). So maybe the decay is determined by the cubic part. Let's suppose that the cubic terms are non-zero. If the phase has a critical point where the gradient of the cubic part is non-degenerate, then the decay rate is determined by the type of singularity.\n\nWait, but in oscillatory integrals, the decay rate is influenced by the order of the phase's derivatives. For example, if the phase has a critical point of finite multiplicity, the decay rate is |a|^{-d/2}, where d is the dimension, but that's for non-degenerate critical points. But here, the phase is a cubic polynomial in two variables. So maybe we can consider the case where the cubic part is non-degenerate. \n\nAlternatively, the general theory for oscillatory integrals in two variables says that if the phase has a critical point at which the Hessian has rank r, then the decay is |a|^{-1/(2 - r/2)}. Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact results.\n\nAlternatively, the decay rate for an oscillatory integral in n variables where the phase has a non-degenerate critical point (i.e., the Hessian is non-singular) is |a|^{-n/2}. Here n=2, so |a|^{-1}. But if the critical point is degenerate, the decay is slower (i.e., less negative exponent). For example, if the phase has a critical point of higher multiplicity, the decay rate would be worse (i.e., |a|^{-1/m} for some m < 2), so the exponent is larger in absolute value but actually worse decay. Wait, no. Wait, for higher multiplicity, the decay is slower, meaning the exponent is less negative, so decay is worse.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for a non-degenerate critical point in two variables, the decay is O(|a|^{-1}), while for a degenerate critical point, the decay could be O(|a|^{-1/2}) or worse.\n\nBut perhaps in this case, the phase function is a cubic polynomial. The cubic terms can create different types of critical points. Let's consider the case where the cubic part is non-degenerate. For example, if we have a cubic form in two variables, which is non-degenerate, then the oscillatory integral decay might be |a|^{-1/2}? Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's think of the standard results. In n dimensions, for an oscillatory integral \u222b e^{i \u03bb \u03c6(x)} dx, where \u03c6 has a single critical point at x=0 which is non-degenerate (i.e., the Hessian is non-singular), then the integral decays like |\u03bb|^{-n/2}. So here, n=2, so decay like |\u03bb|^{-1}. But in our case, the phase is a cubic polynomial. If the leading terms (cubic) are non-degenerate, then perhaps the decay is like |a|^{-1/3}? Because the cubic term is of degree 3, so maybe the scaling is different.\n\nWait, another approach. Suppose that the phase function \u03c6(x,y) = Q(x,y) + cubic terms, but maybe the leading terms are cubic. If we scale variables to make the cubic terms dominant. Let's say we have a phase like a x\u00b3 + b y\u00b3 + ... Let's suppose we set t = |a|^{-1/3}, and scale x = t u, y = t v. Then the cubic terms become a (t u)^3 = a t^3 u\u00b3 = (a t^3) u\u00b3. If a is large, then to balance the phase, we need a t^3 ~ 1, so t ~ |a|^{-1/3}. Then the integral becomes t^2 \u222b e^{i ( ... ) } du dv, since dx dy = t^2 du dv. So the integral would be O(t^2) = O(|a|^{-2/3} ). So |I(a)| ~ |a|^{-2/3} in this case. Then the decay rate is |a|^{-2/3}.\n\nIf that's correct, then the integral I(a) decays like |a|^{-2/3} as |a| \u2192 \u221e. Then, for the L^p norm, we need \u222b |I(a)|^p da ~ \u222b |a|^{-2p/3} da. In R^9, the integral converges if -2p/3 * 9 + (9 -1) < -1? Wait, no. Wait, when integrating in R^n, the integral of |x|^{-k} over the exterior of a ball converges iff k > n. Wait, in R^9, \u222b_{|a|>1} |a|^{-s} da converges iff s > 9.\n\nSo if |I(a)|^p ~ |a|^{-2p/3}, then to have \u222b |a|^{-2p/3} da converge, we need -2p/3 + 9 < 0? Wait, no. Wait, the integral in polar coordinates is \u222b_{r=0}^\\infty r^{8} |I(r)|^p dr. If |I(r)| ~ r^{-2/3}, then |I(r)|^p ~ r^{-2p/3}. So the integrand becomes r^{8 - 2p/3}. For convergence at infinity, we need the exponent 8 - 2p/3 < -1, which gives 8 + 1 < 2p/3 => 9 < 2p/3 => p > 27/2 = 13.5. So the critical p is 27/2. So if p = 27/2, the integral is borderline. Therefore, the largest p for which I is not in L^p is 27/2, since for any p > 27/2, it's in L^p, and for p = 27/2, it might not be.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the largest p such that I is NOT in L^p. So if for p=27/2, the integral diverges, then that's the answer. But how do I know whether at p=27/2 it's in or not? Well, when you integrate r^{8 - 2p/3} dr, for p=27/2, 8 - 2*(27/2)/3 = 8 - (54/6) = 8 - 9 = -1. So integral of r^{-1} dr from 1 to infinity diverges (since integral 1/r dr is log r). Therefore, at p=27/2, the integral diverges, so I is not in L^{27/2}, but for p >27/2, it converges. Hence, the answer is p=27/2.\n\nBut wait, the original assumption was that the decay is |a|^{-2/3}, which came from the scaling argument. But does that hold for all possible a? The problem is that the coefficients a1 to a9 can vary in different directions. For example, if only some of the coefficients are large, the decay might be different. So maybe the minimal decay rate is determined by the worst-case direction where the decay is slowest. So if in some directions the decay is |a|^{-1/2}, but in others it's |a|^{-2/3}, then the worst decay (slowest) is |a|^{-1/2}, so the overall decay would be dominated by that. But according to the scaling argument for cubic terms, it's |a|^{-2/3}.\n\nAlternatively, if the phase includes lower-degree terms (quadratic, linear), but the leading terms are cubic, then the decay should be governed by the cubic terms. Because when |a| is large, the cubic terms dominate the phase, so the lower-degree terms can be treated as perturbations. Therefore, the decay rate should be |a|^{-2/3} as in the scaling argument.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: the oscillatory integral's decay is related to the so-called \"type\" of the phase function. For a homogeneous phase function of degree d in n variables, the decay is |a|^{-n/d}. Wait, if the phase is homogeneous of degree d, then scaling x by t, so that the phase becomes a (t x)^d = a t^d x^d. To balance the phase, set t such that a t^d = 1, so t = a^{-1/d}. Then the integral becomes t^n \u222b e^{i x^d} dx, so the decay is t^n = a^{-n/d}. Therefore, in this case, n=2 variables, d=3 (cubic), so decay |a|^{-2/3}, which matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, if the phase is homogeneous of degree 3, then the decay is |a|^{-2/3}. But in our case, the phase is a general cubic polynomial with lower-degree terms. However, when |a| is large, the lower-degree terms can be dominated by the cubic terms if we assume that the coefficients of the cubic terms are large. But the integral I(a) depends on all coefficients a1 to a9. So if only some coefficients are large, the decay might differ.\n\nWait, but the problem is considering I as a function in L^p(R^9). So we have to integrate over all possible a1,...,a9. The worst decay would occur along directions in the parameter space where the phase function's decay is slowest. So for example, if we consider paths in R^9 where only the cubic coefficients (a6, a7, a8, a9) are becoming large, while the others are zero, then the decay would be as |a|^{-2/3}. If along another path, say, only quadratic terms are large, then the decay might be different. For quadratic terms, in two variables, the decay is |a|^{-1}, which is better (faster decay) than |a|^{-2/3}, so it doesn't contribute to the worst case.\n\nSimilarly, if the linear terms are large, then the phase would have no critical points, leading to rapid decay (faster than polynomial), so those directions would not affect the L^p integrability.\n\nTherefore, the worst decay (slowest) occurs when the cubic terms are large, leading to |a|^{-2/3}. So the L^p integrability is determined by this decay rate. Hence, as before, the critical p is 27/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be p = 27/2, which is 13.5, so written as 27/2.\n\nSo the largest p where I is not in L^p is 27/2.\n",
