  "question": "Let $S^n$ denote the $n$-dimensional sphere. Among all choices of $n \\ge 2$ what is the largest number of continuous group operations admitted by $S^n$? Give the exact cardinality.",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the maximum number of continuous group operations on an n-dimensional sphere S\u207f for n \u2265 2. Hmm, first, I need to recall what a group operation is in this context. A continuous group operation means the sphere has a Lie group structure, right? Because a Lie group is a group that's also a differentiable manifold, and the group operations are smooth.\n\nWait, but which spheres can actually be Lie groups? I remember that the only spheres that admit a Lie group structure are S\u00b9, S\u00b3, and S\u2077. Let me verify that. S\u00b9 is the circle group, which is abelian. S\u00b3 can be identified with the group of unit quaternions, which is non-abelian. S\u2077 has something to do with octonions, but octonions aren't associative, so maybe S\u2077 isn't a Lie group after all. Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.\n\nHold on, maybe I confused something. The spheres that are parallelizable are S\u00b9, S\u00b3, S\u2077. But being parallelizable is a different condition from being a Lie group. For example, S\u2077 is parallelizable but does it have a Lie group structure? I think that only S\u00b9, S\u00b3 are Lie groups. Because the octonions are non-associative, so their multiplication isn't a group operation (since groups require associativity). Therefore, S\u2077 can't be a Lie group. So only n=1,3.\n\nBut the question says n \u2265 2. So among n=2,3,4,... So n=3 is allowed. Then S\u00b3 is a Lie group, so it has at least one continuous group operation. But the question is asking for the largest number of such operations. Wait, but can a sphere admit more than one Lie group structure?\n\nWait, but maybe up to isomorphism. If we consider different Lie group structures as different operations, even if they are isomorphic. Wait, but S\u00b3 with the quaternion group operation is the only one. Because the group structure on S\u00b3 is essentially SU(2), which is the only simply connected Lie group of dimension 3 with a certain Lie algebra. But does S\u00b3 have any other group structures? Maybe if you take a different product, but I think that any Lie group structure on S\u00b3 would be isomorphic to SU(2) or something else. Wait, but maybe the same manifold can have different group operations? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about distinct group structures up to isomorphism, but the actual number of different continuous group operations (i.e., different multiplication maps) that the sphere can have. But that's more complicated. For instance, on S\u00b9, the usual multiplication is a group operation, but you could maybe reverse the multiplication and get another one. But they would be isomorphic as Lie groups.\n\nBut in the case of S\u00b3, since SU(2) is a simple Lie group, perhaps there is only one Lie group structure. Wait, but for example, SU(2) is diffeomorphic to S\u00b3, and the only Lie group structure on S\u00b3 is that of SU(2) or perhaps a different one if you have some exotic differentiable structure? But the question probably assumes the standard smooth structure on S\u207f.\n\nSo, if we're considering standard spheres with their usual smooth structures, then S\u00b9 and S\u00b3 can be made into Lie groups. But the question is for n \u2265 2, so n=2,3,4,... So the only candidate here is S\u00b3. Therefore, S\u00b3 has a Lie group structure, so it has at least one continuous group operation. The other spheres, like S\u00b2, S\u2074, etc., can't have a Lie group structure because of topological obstructions. For example, S\u00b2 is not a Lie group because it's not parallelizable (hairy ball theorem), and only S\u00b9, S\u00b3, S\u2077 are parallelizable. Wait, but S\u2077 is parallelizable but can't be a Lie group because of associativity. So S\u00b3 is the only sphere with n \u2265 2 that is a Lie group. Therefore, S\u00b3 admits a continuous group operation. Are there others? If there's only one possible continuous group operation (up to isomorphism or not), then the cardinality is 1. But maybe you can have different operations?\n\nWait, but for example, on S\u00b9, the group operation can be rotation clockwise or counterclockwise, but those are isomorphic. Similarly, on S\u00b3, maybe different group operations could be defined, but they might be isomorphic. Alternatively, perhaps the only Lie group structure on S\u00b3 is the standard one, hence the cardinality is 1. But then, the question is asking for the exact cardinality of the number of continuous group operations admitted by S\u207f among all n \u2265 2. So the maximum such number. So if S\u00b3 can have one such operation, and other spheres (n \u22652) can't have any, then the answer is 1. But wait, perhaps S\u2077 can have some non-associative operations? But the question specifies group operations, which require associativity. So S\u2077 can't. Therefore, only S\u00b3 has 1 continuous group operation. So across all n \u22652, the largest number is 1. Hence, the exact cardinality is 1. So the answer is 1. But let me check again.\n\nWait, could there be more than one group structure on S\u00b3? For example, perhaps different multiplication operations that are not isomorphic. For instance, if you take SU(2) and then maybe some outer automorphism. But SU(2) is a simple Lie group, and I think its Lie algebra is unique. Since S\u00b3 is simply connected, the Lie group structure is determined by its Lie algebra. Since SU(2) has a unique Lie algebra structure, there can be only one Lie group structure on S\u00b3 up to isomorphism. But maybe different multiplications if you vary the group operation. Wait, but if you change the multiplication in a way that it's still a Lie group, but the operation is different. But I think that any two Lie group structures on S\u00b3 would be isomorphic as Lie groups, meaning that the operations are essentially the same up to diffeomorphism. Therefore, the number of continuous group operations (up to isomorphism) would be 1. But if the question is not considering isomorphic structures as different, then the answer is 1. But if the question counts different operations (even if isomorphic) as distinct, then maybe there could be more? For example, choosing different generators or something. But I think that in the category of Lie groups, two groups are considered the same if they are isomorphic. So the standard answer would be that S\u00b3 has exactly one Lie group structure, hence one continuous group operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the cardinality of possible distinct group operations (not up to isomorphism). For instance, if you can define different multiplication maps on S\u00b3 that satisfy the group axioms, even if they result in isomorphic groups. But even so, I don't think there are multiple such structures. Because SU(2) is the only simply connected 3-dimensional compact Lie group, so any other group structure would have to be isomorphic to that. So even if you write the multiplication differently, it's essentially the same group. So maybe the cardinality is 1.\n\nBut wait, the sphere S^0 is two points, but n \u22652 here. So for n=3, it's 1. All other n \u22652 spheres have 0. Therefore, the largest number is 1. So the exact cardinality is 1. Hence, the answer is 1.\n",
