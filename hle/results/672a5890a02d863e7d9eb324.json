  "question": "Determine the minimal number of distinct colors required to achieve a proper vertex coloring of a non-planar graph that encompasses a complete subgraph consisting of five mutually adjacent vertices.",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimal number of distinct colors required for a proper vertex coloring of a non-planar graph that contains a complete subgraph of five vertices (K5). Let me start by recalling what a proper vertex coloring is. Each vertex must be assigned a color such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The minimal number of colors needed is called the chromatic number of the graph.\n\nFirst, the graph in question is non-planar and includes K5 as a subgraph. I remember that planar graphs have a chromatic number of at most four due to the Four Color Theorem. But since this graph is non-planar, that theorem doesn't apply here. However, the presence of K5 is significant because the chromatic number of K5 itself is 5. That is because in a complete graph, every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, so each must have a distinct color. So, if the graph contains K5 as a subgraph, then the chromatic number of the entire graph must be at least 5, since the K5 subgraph requires 5 colors.\n\nNow, the question is whether the chromatic number could be exactly 5 or if the non-planarity adds any additional constraints that might require more colors. Wait, non-planar graphs can sometimes have higher chromatic numbers, but if the graph is non-planar because it contains K5, the key factor here is that K5's chromatic number is 5. Even if the entire graph has more vertices or edges beyond K5, the chromatic number can't be less than 5 because the K5 subgraph already needs 5. But could the overall graph require more than 5? For example, maybe if there's another structure in the graph that needs more. But the question states that the graph \"encompasses\" a K5, which I think just means it contains K5 as a subgraph. So the rest of the graph could be colored with 5 colors as long as it's possible. \n\nBut wait, non-planar graphs in general can have higher chromatic numbers. For example, a complete graph with more than four nodes is non-planar, and its chromatic number equals its number of nodes. However, if the graph has K5 as a subgraph but isn't necessarily a complete graph itself, maybe it can still be colored with 5 colors. For instance, if the rest of the graph doesn't form a larger complete graph, maybe 5 colors suffice. But the question is about the minimal number. So the answer should be 5 because the presence of K5 requires at least 5 colors, and since the graph could be K5 itself (which is non-planar and requires 5 colors), the minimal number is 5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a non-planar graph that includes K5 but requires more than 5 colors. But I can't think of such a graph. Let me think of an example. Suppose you have K5 plus another vertex connected in a way that doesn't form a K6. For example, adding a vertex connected to all five vertices of K5. Then, this new vertex is adjacent to all five, so it would need a sixth color. But wait, K5 plus a vertex connected to all five would create a K6, which would require 6 colors. Wait, no. If you connect a new vertex to all five vertices of K5, does that make a K6? No, because K6 requires that every pair of the six vertices is connected. In this case, the new vertex is connected to all five in K5, but the other five are already connected among themselves (as it's K5). So the subgraph here would be K5 plus a vertex connected to all K5's vertices. That's called a K5 with an additional universal vertex. However, in such a case, the new vertex is adjacent to all five, so it needs a sixth color. But wait, if K5 uses colors 1-5, then the new vertex can't use any of those, so it needs color 6. Therefore, such a graph would require 6 colors. But is that graph non-planar? Yes, because K5 is a subgraph. But then, in that case, if the graph includes K5 plus more edges or vertices, the chromatic number could be higher than 5. However, the question is asking for the minimal number required for any non-planar graph that includes K5. So the minimal possible number would be 5, because there exists a non-planar graph (like K5 itself) that requires exactly 5 colors. Therefore, even though some non-planar graphs containing K5 might require more colors, the minimal number is 5, since that's the chromatic number of K5, which is a valid example of such a graph. So the answer should be 5.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: A proper vertex coloring requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. A complete subgraph \\( K_5 \\) (5 mutually adjacent vertices) inherently needs 5 distinct colors because every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. The graph in question is non-planar and contains \\( K_5 \\), so its chromatic number must be at least 5. While some non-planar graphs containing \\( K_5 \\) might require more colors (e.g., larger complete graphs), the minimal number is determined by the simplest case where the graph itself is \\( K_5 \\), which requires exactly 5 colors. \n\nAnswer: 5  \nConfidence: 100%",
