  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking for the name of a river in Europe that's over 780 km long and, when rounded to the nearest whole kilometer, the length is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, like 121 or 1331.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some major European rivers and their lengths. Let's list them out. The Danube comes to mind; it's one of the longest, flowing through several countries. The Rhine, the Volga, the Dnieper, the Elbe, the Loire, the Tagus... Wait, the Volga is actually in Russia, which is part of both Europe and Asia, but the main part is considered European. Its length is around 3,692 km, which is way longer than 780, but 3692 isn't a palindrome. The Danube is about 2,850 km. 2850 rounded is 2850, which reversed is 0582, not the same. So that's not a palindrome.\n\nWait, maybe a shorter river. Let's think. The requirement is above 780 km. Let's see. The Elbe is around 1,094 km. If we round that, it's 1094, which is not a palindrome. The Rhine is about 1,230 km. 1230 reversed is 0321, which is 321, so no. The Loire is about 1,012 km. Rounded to 1012. That's 1012 reversed is 2101, not the same. The Oder is 854 km. 854 reversed is 458, which isn't the same. Wait, but 854 is above 780. Hmm, but 854 is 854, which isn't a palindrome. What about the Vistula? It's 1,047 km. Rounded to 1047. 1047 reversed is 7401, not a palindrome.\n\nWait, maybe a river that's around 797 km? Because 797 is a palindrome. Let's check. The Sava River is a tributary of the Danube. Its length is approximately 940 km. Wait, 940 isn't a palindrome. The Tisza River is around 966 km. 966 reversed is 669, which is not the same. Hmm. The Drava is about 710 km, which is below 780. The Po River in Italy is 652 km, too short. The Rh\u00f4ne is 812 km. Wait, 812 rounded is 812. Reverse is 218, not a palindrome. Wait, but 812 is over 780. Let me check again: 812 km. 812 reversed is 218. Not a palindrome. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the Ural River? It's part of the border between Europe and Asia. Its length is 2,428 km. 2428 reversed is 8242, which doesn't match. No. What about the Don River in Russia? Approximately 1,870 km. 1870 reversed is 0781, which is 781. Not the same. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps a river that's exactly 797 km when rounded. Let me think of rivers in the 790s. For example, if a river is 797 km long, that's a palindrome. Or if it's 808 km, which is also a palindrome. Let's see. The Ebro River in Spain is about 910 km. 910 reversed is 019, which is 19. Not a palindrome. The Guadiana River between Spain and Portugal is 818 km. Wait, 818 reversed is 818. That's a palindrome! Let me confirm the length of the Guadiana. Quick check: The Guadiana's length is often cited as around 818 km. So if we take that exact number, rounding isn't needed. So the length is 818 km, which is a palindrome. And it flows through Spain and Portugal. Both are European countries. So that fits. The question says \"one European country\", but the Guadiana flows through both Spain and Portugal, but either way, each country is a European country. So yes, Guadiana would be the answer here.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The Guadiana River, flowing through Spain and Portugal, has a length of approximately 818 km. When rounded to the nearest whole number, 818 is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). It meets the criteria of being over 780 km and located in a European country.  \nAnswer: Guadiana  \nConfidence: 95%",
