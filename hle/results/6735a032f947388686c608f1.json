  "question": "What is the largest natural number n such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero? ",
  "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The question is asking for the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero. Hmm, I remember that K-groups, or algebraic K-theory groups, relate to things like projective modules over rings. But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the K-groups of finite cyclic groups like Z/mZ look like. I think for the ring Z/mZ, the algebraic K-theory groups K_n(Z/mZ) have some periodicity properties. Wait, Quillen computed some of these groups, right? Or maybe it's more related to the work of someone like Dennis or Stein?\n\nWait, there's a result that says for a ring A with an ideal I such that I is nilpotent, the K-groups of A and A/I are related via a long exact sequence. But Z/27 isn't a field; it's a ring with characteristic 27. Since 27 is 3^3, the ring Z/27 has a unique maximal ideal generated by 3. But does that help here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the K-groups of finite rings. Specifically, for Z/p^k where p is prime. There's a theorem in algebraic K-theory that relates the K-groups of such rings. For example, I remember that for the ring Z/p^k, the K-groups vanish above a certain degree. But up to what degree?\n\nWait, the question is about the (2n)th K-group being nonzero. So we need the highest n where K_{2n}(Z/27) isn't zero. The answer would then depend on the known vanishing ranges for K-theory of such rings.\n\nI recall that for a finite ring like Z/p^k, the K-groups are known to be finite abelian groups. Moreover, there's a result that says K_n(Z/p^k) is zero for sufficiently large n. Specifically, for rings with finite exponent, the K-theory groups eventually vanish. But the exact range where they vanish is key here.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the relationship between K-theory and topological cyclic homology (TC). Sometimes, the vanishing of K-groups can be inferred via TC methods, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe this is connected to the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture, which relates K-theory to \u00e9tale cohomology. But that applies more to rings of integers in number fields. Not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, think about the K-theory of the integers modulo m. There's a paper by Hesselholt and Madsen which calculates the topological cyclic homology of Z/p^k, and from that, one can deduce the K-theory. In particular, for odd primes, they show that the K-groups of Z/p^k vanish in high degrees. Let me try to recall the exact statement.\n\nIn their work, Hesselholt and Madsen computed TC(Z/p^k), and from the cyclotomic trace map, K-theory can be approximated. For example, they showed that for Z/p^k, the K-groups K_i vanish for i \u2265 2p-2. Wait, p is 3 here since 27 is 3^3. So p=3, so 2p-2=4. So according to this, K_i(Z/27) would vanish for i \u22654. But wait, the question is about K_{2n} being nonzero. So if they vanish for i \u22654, then the highest even n where 2n < 4 would be n=1 (since 2n=2) and n=2 would be 4, but K_4 is zero. So the largest n would be 1? But that seems low. Wait, maybe this is incorrect.\n\nWait, another thought. The algebraic K-theory of Z/p^k for p odd is known to have K_{2i} isomorphic to (Z/p^{k})^m for some m, up to some degree. Wait, but maybe for Z/p^k, the even K-groups are cyclic groups? Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the K-theory of finite fields. Wait, but Z/27 isn't a field, it's a ring with nilpotent elements. The K-theory of finite fields is well-understood: K_{2i} of a finite field F_q is zero, and K_{2i-1} is cyclic of order q^i -1. But Z/27 isn't a field, so that doesn't directly apply.\n\nWait, but maybe for Z/p^k, there's a similar decomposition. For example, the K-groups of Z/p^k can be related to those of the residue field F_p. But since Z/p^k is a local ring with residue field F_p, there's a fiber sequence in K-theory. The localization sequence: K(F_p) \u2192 K(Z/p^k) \u2192 K(Z/p^k, (p)) \u2192 ... But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the work of Rognes and others on the K-theory of truncated polynomial algebras and similar rings. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that Z/p^k is a connective ring spectrum, but this is getting too abstract.\n\nWait, stepping back. The question is about the 2n-th K-group. For the ring Z/27, and n as large as possible such that K_{2n}(Z/27) is non-zero. The answer is likely small because K-groups of finite rings tend to vanish in higher degrees. For example, for the field F_p, the even K-groups are zero, but here we have a ring with characteristic p^k, not a field.\n\nWait, perhaps if I look at specific computations. For example, K_0(Z/27) is the Grothendieck group of finitely generated projective modules. Since Z/27 is local (as it's a finite local ring), every projective module is free, so K_0(Z/27) is Z, but in reality, for a local ring, K_0 is always Z, generated by the free module of rank 1. But in this case, since the ring is finite, maybe K_0 is actually cyclic? Wait, no. For a local ring, K_0 is indeed Z, because the only projective modules are free of finite rank, and the Grothendieck group is generated by [R], so it's isomorphic to Z. But I think in some cases, when the ring is finite, perhaps there's some torsion. Wait, no, K_0 doesn't see torsion. For example, even if the ring is finite, the K_0 group is still Z. Because projective modules over local rings are free, so the Grothendieck group is generated by the free modules, hence Z. So K_0(Z/27) is Z. But the question is about higher K-groups.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the (2n)th K-group of Z/27\". If K_0 is Z, then K_0 is nonzero, but that's the 0th group, which is even. But the question is about the largest n such that K_{2n} is nonzero. So starting from n=0, K_0 is Z, so that's nonzero. Then K_2, K_4, etc. But for finite rings, higher K-groups tend to be torsion. Maybe K_2(Z/27) is nonzero, but K_4(Z/27) is zero? Then the answer would be n=1 (since 2n=2). But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the higher even K-groups are related to the multiplicative groups. Wait, K_1 of a ring is the group of units. So K_1(Z/27) is the units of Z/27, which is multiplicative group of integers mod 27. That has order \u03c6(27)=18. So K_1 is a finite abelian group of order 18. So K_1 is nonzero. K_2 of a ring is related to Milnor K-theory or Steinberg symbols. For a finite ring, K_2(Z/27) might be non-zero. Let me check.\n\nBut actually, for local rings, there are some computations. For example, for Z/p^k, K_2 can be computed. There's a formula for K_2 of truncated polynomial rings. Wait, but Z/p^k isn't a truncated polynomial ring. Wait, Z/p^k is a principal ideal ring, and it's local with maximal ideal (p). So maybe apply some known formula.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about known results. For example, in \"Algebraic K-theory\" by Srinivas, there's a mention that for a ring A with an ideal I such that I is nilpotent, K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is surjective for n=1 and an isomorphism for n \u22652. Wait, but that's when A is a radical ideal. Wait, if A is a ring with an ideal I such that I is contained in the Jacobson radical, and A/I has K_n(A/I) \u2192 K_{n-1}(I) is part of a long exact sequence. Maybe this is the local case.\n\nBut given that Z/27 is a local ring with residue field F_3. Then we can consider the reduction map Z/27 \u2192 F_3, which has kernel the ideal (3). Since (3) is a nilpotent ideal (as 3^3=0 in Z/27). Then there is a long exact sequence relating K-groups of Z/27, F_3, and the ideal (3). However, the ideal (3) is isomorphic as a ring without unit to ... Hmm, maybe this isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that for a nilpotent extension, the K-theory in positive degrees is an isomorphism. Wait, but I thought that Quillen's theorem says that if I is a nilpotent ideal, then K_n(A,I) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism. But I might be mixing up the statements. Wait, in general, for a surjective ring homomorphism with kernel I, if I is nilpotent, then the relative K-groups K_n(A,I) vanish, so the map K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism. Is that true? If so, then K_n(Z/27) would be isomorphic to K_n(F_3) for all n \u22651. But F_3 is a finite field, so K_n(F_3) is known. For finite fields, K_{2i} is zero and K_{2i-1} is cyclic of order q^i -1. So K_1(F_3) is F_3^*, which is cyclic of order 2. K_2(F_3) is zero. K_3(F_3) is cyclic of order 8 (since 3^2 -1=8). Then K_4(F_3) is zero, K_5(F_3) is cyclic of order 80 (3^3 -1=26? Wait, no, wait. For finite field F_q, K_{2i-1}(F_q) is cyclic of order q^i -1. So for F_3: K_1 is order 2 (3^1 -1=2). K_3 is order 3^2 -1=8. K_5 is 3^3 -1=26, which is 26. So if the K-theory of Z/27 is isomorphic to that of F_3 in positive degrees, then K_n(Z/27) for n\u22651 would be same as K_n(F_3). Then since K_{2i}(F_3)=0 for all i\u22651, so K_2, K_4, etc., of Z/27 would be zero. But K_0(Z/27) is Z, but that's the only even one. Therefore, in this case, the answer would be n=0. But the question says \"natural number n\", so n=0 is allowed? But the problem says \"natural number\", which sometimes is considered to start at 1. Wait, but the problem statement says \"natural number n\", which could be 0 or 1 depending on convention.\n\nWait, wait. If the reduction map Z/27 \u2192 F_3 induces isomorphisms on K_n for n \u22651, then K_{2n}(Z/27) would be zero for all n \u22651. So the only even K-group that's non-zero is K_0. So the largest n would be 0. But the question is about the largest natural number n. If natural numbers here are defined as positive integers (1,2,3,...), then there is no such n, but K_0 is non-zero. Hmm, but maybe in the problem's context, natural numbers include zero. But this is unclear.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the (2n)th K-group\". If n is a natural number here starting at 1, then 2n starts at 2. But if n=0 is allowed, then 0th K-group is K_0. But the problem might be expecting n to be at least 1, but that's unclear.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, if the K-groups of Z/27 for n \u22651 are the same as those of F_3, which have even K-groups zero, then the answer would be n=0. But the answer is supposed to be a natural number. If the problem assumes natural numbers start at 1, then there are no even K-groups nonzero beyond K_0, so the answer would be no solution. But that can't be. Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the result by Hesselholt and Madsen, they might have said that K_i(Z/p^k) vanishes for i \u2265 2p-2. For p=3, that's i \u22654. So K_4 and above vanish. Then K_2 and K_3 would be non-zero? Wait, but earlier reasoning via the Quillen's result says K_n(Z/27) is isomorphic to K_n(F_3) for n \u22651. So in that case, K_2 would be zero. Hmm, conflicting information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the result about nilpotent ideals applies only when the ideal is in the radical, but even so, in this case, (3) is in the Jacobson radical of Z/27. So perhaps Quillen's theorem does apply here, making K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3) for all n \u22651. Then as K_2(F_3)=0, K_4(F_3)=0, etc., the only non-zero even K-group would be K_0. So the answer would be n=0. But the problem says \"natural number\", which usually starts from 1. But maybe the problem allows n=0. Let me check the exact question again.\n\nThe question is: \"What is the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero?\" So if n is allowed to be 0, then 2n=0, and K_0 is nonzero. If natural numbers start at 1, then the answer is no solution. But since the problem is asking for a natural number, and K-groups in even degrees beyond 0 are zero, then the answer should be n=0, but only if 0 is considered a natural number here. However, in many mathematical contexts, natural numbers start at 1, but sometimes include 0. This is ambiguous. But given that K_0 is nonzero, and if the problem allows n=0, then that's the answer. Otherwise, if n must be positive, then there is no such n, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption that K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3) for n \u22651 is incorrect. Maybe there's a higher K-group that doesn't vanish. For example, maybe K_2(Z/27) is non-zero. Let's look for references. \n\nLooking up, I recall that for the ring R = Z/p^k, the K-groups K_n(R) for n \u22652 are isomorphic to K_n(R, (p)), the relative K-groups. But in the case where the ideal (p) is nilpotent, the relative K-theory might be related to the cyclic homology or something else. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. The K-theory of Z/p^k can be computed using the framework of topological cyclic homology (TC) via the cyclotomic trace. According to Hesselholt and Madsen's work, for odd primes p, the K-groups of Z/p^k vanish above degree 2p-2. For p=3, 2p-2=4. So K_i(Z/27) =0 for i \u22654. Therefore, the possible non-zero K-groups are up to degree 3.\n\nBut wait, if p=3, then 2p-2=4, so K_4 and higher vanish. Therefore, K_0, K_1, K_2, K_3 could be non-zero. Now, for K_0 we know it's Z. For K_1, it's the units, which is Z/18. For K_2, perhaps it's non-zero. If Hesselholt and Madsen's calculation says that K_2(Z/27) is non-zero, then maybe the answer is n=1 (since 2n=2). Then K_2 is non-zero, K_4 is zero. So the largest n would be 1.\n\nBut how do we know if K_2(Z/27) is non-zero? Let's think. If the Quillen's result that K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3) for n \u22651 is correct, then K_2(Z/27) would be zero, as K_2(F_3)=0. But maybe this is only true for n \u22652? Or maybe the result requires the ideal to be not just nilpotent but something else. \n\nAlternatively, there's a result called the \"fundamental theorem of K-theory\" which gives a long exact sequence for K-groups of a ring with an ideal. For the ideal (3) in Z/27, which is nilpotent (since 3^3=0), the long exact sequence would be ... \u2192 K_n(3Z/27) \u2192 K_n(Z/27) \u2192 K_n(F_3) \u2192 K_{n-1}(3Z/27) \u2192 ... But 3Z/27 is a module over Z/27, but I'm not sure how to compute its K-groups. However, since (3) is a nilpotent ideal, maybe the K-groups of Z/27 and F_3 are related. \n\nWait, according to Quillen's d\u00e9vissage theorem, which applies to abelian categories, if you have a nilpotent extension, the K-theory of the two rings are the same. Specifically, if I is a nilpotent ideal in a ring A, then the category of finitely generated projective A-modules is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective A/I-modules. Wait, but this only affects K_0. For higher K-groups, there's a theorem that says that if I is a nilpotent ideal, then K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism for all n \u22650. Wait, is that true? If so, then for Z/27, since (3) is a nilpotent ideal, then K_n(Z/27) \u2192 K_n(F_3) is an isomorphism for all n \u22650. But K_0(F_3)=Z, which matches K_0(Z/27)=Z. K_1(F_3)=F_3^*=Z/2, but K_1(Z/27)= (Z/27)^* which is Z/18. That contradicts the previous statement. So clearly, the theorem I'm recalling must have some other conditions. \n\nAh, perhaps the theorem requires that the ideal I is in the radical of A. In this case, (3) is indeed in the Jacobson radical of Z/27, since Z/27 is local. Then, according to the theorem, the map K_n(Z/27) \u2192 K_n(F_3) is an isomorphism for n \u22651. But K_1(Z/27) is (Z/27)^*, which is Z/18, and K_1(F_3) is Z/2. These aren't isomorphic. So that contradicts the idea that the map is an isomorphism. Therefore, my previous reasoning is flawed.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to revisit the exact statement of the theorem. Perhaps it's not an isomorphism, but a surjection for n=1 and isomorphism for n \u22652. For example, Theorem 5.1 in Chapter III of Weibel's K-book: If I is a nilpotent ideal in a ring A, then for each n \u22651, K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is surjective, and it is an isomorphism for n \u22652 if A is commutative. Wait, is that the case?\n\nAccording to Weibel's \"K-book\", Corollary 1.5 in Chapter III states that if I is a nilpotent ideal in a ring A, then K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is surjective for n=1 and an isomorphism for all n \u22652. Therefore, in our case, since (3) is a nilpotent ideal in Z/27, then for n \u22652, K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3). But for n=1, the map is surjective. So K_1(Z/27) \u2192 K_1(F_3) is surjective, so there's a short exact sequence:\n\n0 \u2192 K_1(Z/27, I) \u2192 K_1(Z/27) \u2192 K_1(F_3) \u2192 0.\n\nBut K_1(Z/27, I) is the relative K_1 group. In the case of a surjective map with kernel I, the relative K_1 group K_1(A,I) is isomorphic to 1 + I. Since I = (3) in Z/27, which is 3Z/27Z. Then 1 + I is the subgroup of the multiplicative group (Z/27)^* consisting of elements congruent to 1 mod 3. Let's see: (Z/27)^* has \u03c6(27)=18 elements. The elements congruent to 1 mod 3 form a subgroup. Let's compute:\n\nElements in Z/27 that are congruent to 1 mod 3 are numbers of the form 1 + 3k mod 27, where k=0,...,8. So there are 9 elements. Thus, 1 + I has order 9. Therefore, K_1(Z/27, I) is isomorphic to this multiplicative subgroup, which is cyclic if 9 is prime power. Since 9 is 3^2, and the multiplicative group of 1 + I in this case is isomorphic to Z/9. Because in Z/27, the multiplicative group 1 + 3Z/27 is isomorphic to Z/9. Let me check:\n\nTake 1 + 3 mod 27. Let's compute its order. (1 + 3)^n \u2261 1 + 3n mod 9. Wait, but we're working modulo 27. Let's compute (1 + 3)^3 = 1 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 9 + 27 + 27. Wait, but in modulo 27, 27 is 0. So (1 + 3)^3 \u2261 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10 mod 27. Continuing, (1 + 3)^9. Wait, this might not be cyclic. Alternatively, using the logarithm map for the multiplicative group. The multiplicative group of Z/27 is cyclic of order 18. The subgroup 1 + 3Z/27 has order 9, which is a cyclic subgroup of order 9. Therefore, K_1(Z/27, I) \u2245 Z/9. Therefore, the exact sequence:\n\n0 \u2192 Z/9 \u2192 K_1(Z/27) \u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0.\n\nBut K_1(Z/27) is the units group of Z/27, which is Z/18. So the exact sequence must split, giving Z/18 \u2245 Z/9 \u00d7 Z/2. But since 9 and 2 are coprime, Z/18 is cyclic, so this can't split as a direct product. Wait, so there's a contradiction. This suggests that my understanding is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relative K_1 group is not 1 + I. Let me recall that K_1(A,I) is defined as GL(A,I)/E(A,I), where GL(A,I) is the kernel of GL(A) \u2192 GL(A/I), and E(A,I) is the subgroup generated by elementary matrices. But for a commutative local ring like Z/27, I think that K_1(A,I) is indeed 1 + I, which in this case is isomorphic to the additive group of I. Wait, but I is an additive group isomorphic to Z/9, and 1 + I is multiplicatively a subgroup. Let's compute 1 + 3Z/27Z.\n\nThe elements are 1, 1+3=4, 1+6=7, 1+9=10, 1+12=13, 1+15=16, 1+18=19, 1+21=22, 1+24=25 mod 27. So these are the elements congruent to 1 mod 3. The multiplicative order of 4 mod 27. Let's compute powers:\n\n4^1 =4\n\n4^2 =16\n\n4^3 =64 \u2261 10\n\n4^4 =40 \u226113\n\n4^5=52\u226125\n\n4^6=100\u226119\n\n4^7=76\u226122\n\n4^8=88\u22617\n\n4^9=28\u22611 mod27. So the multiplicative order of 4 mod 27 is 9. Therefore, the subgroup 1 + I is cyclic of order 9, generated by 4. Therefore, it's Z/9. \n\nTherefore, the exact sequence is 0 \u2192 Z/9 \u2192 Z/18 \u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0. But Z/18 is cyclic, and this sequence can't split as a direct sum because Z/9 \u00d7 Z/2 is not cyclic. So there must be a non-split extension. However, in reality, Z/18 is cyclic, so the exact sequence here is actually:\n\n0 \u2192 Z/9 \u2192 Z/18 \u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0\n\nWhich corresponds to the subgroup Z/9 of Z/18. But since Z/18 is cyclic, every subgroup of order 9 is cyclic, and the quotient is Z/2. So this sequence is valid, but K_1(Z/27) is cyclic of order 18. So the map from Z/9 to Z/18 is injective, and the quotient is Z/2. But this suggests that the relative K_1 group is Z/9, K_1(Z/27) is Z/18, and K_1(F_3) is Z/2. So the exact sequence holds.\n\nBut according to Quillen's theorem, for n \u22652, K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3). So for n=2, K_2(Z/27) \u2245 K_2(F_3). But K_2(F_3) is zero. Therefore, K_2(Z/27)=0. Similarly, K_3(Z/27) \u2245 K_3(F_3). K_3(F_3) is isomorphic to Z/8, according to Quillen's computation. For finite fields, K_{2i-1}(F_q) is Z/(q^i -1). So K_3(F_3)=Z/(3^2 -1)=Z/8. So K_3(Z/27) \u2245 Z/8. Then K_4(Z/27) \u2245 K_4(F_3)=0, and so on. Therefore, the even K-groups of Z/27 beyond K_0 are zero. Hence, the largest n where K_{2n}(Z/27) is nonzero is n=0. But if the problem considers natural numbers starting from 1, then there is no such n, which can't be. Hence, the answer is n=0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the question is phrased as \"the largest natural number n\". If n must be a positive integer, then there is no such n, but since K_0 is Z, which is nonzero, and n=0 would give K_0. But the problem says \"natural number\", which in mathematics sometimes includes zero and sometimes doesn't. However, in many contexts, especially in algebraic K-theory, the numbering starts at n=0,1,2, etc. So if the problem allows n=0, then the answer is 0, otherwise, it's impossible. But the problem likely expects n=0 as the answer.\n\nBut I need to verify the original question again. The problem says \"the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero\". If n is a natural number, and if natural numbers include 0, then yes, n=0. However, in some contexts, natural numbers start at 1. This is a bit ambiguous. However, given that K_0 is always considered in K-theory, and the problem mentions \"natural number\", it's possible that the answer is n=0. Alternatively, the problem might have a different intended approach.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming Quillen's theorem applies here. Because Quillen's theorem says that for a nilpotent ideal I in a ring A, K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism for n \u22652 and surjective for n=1. So K_2(Z/27) \u2245 K_2(F_3). But K_2 of a field is Milnor K-theory, which for F_3 is zero. So K_2(F_3)=0. Hence, K_2(Z/27)=0. Similarly, K_4(Z/27)=0. So the only even K-group that is non-zero is K_0. Therefore, the answer must be n=0. But since the problem asks for natural number n, which may or may not include zero. If the answer is supposed to be 0, then put 0. But sometimes in problems, especially if they ask for \"natural number\", they might expect n \u22651.\n\nWait, but considering that the K-groups in even positive degrees are zero, the answer might be n=0. However, in some references, the K-groups of Z/p^k are known to have K_2 non-zero. For example, according to some papers, K_2(Z/9) is cyclic of order 3. If that's the case, then for Z/9, K_2 is non-zero, so for Z/27, maybe K_2 is non-zero. Then the answer would be n=1. But this contradicts the earlier application of Quillen's theorem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming Quillen's theorem applies here. Let's check the specific case of Z/p^k. If I is the ideal (p), then the quotient is F_p. But for K-theory, the result that K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism for n \u22652 holds for any ring A with a nilpotent ideal I. So for Z/p^k, this would imply K_n(Z/p^k) \u2245 K_n(F_p) for n \u22652. But does this hold?\n\nBut wait, for example, K_2(Z/4) is known to be isomorphic to Z/2, which is non-zero, while K_2(F_2) is zero. So this contradicts the theorem. Therefore, my previous reasoning must be flawed. Therefore, Quillen's theorem must not apply in this case. But why?\n\nAh, maybe Quillen's theorem requires the ideal to be in the radical and the ring to be commutative. But in this case, Z/p^k is commutative, and the ideal (p) is indeed in the radical. So why does K_2(Z/4) not vanish? Maybe because K_2(Z/4) is non-zero. This suggests that the theorem is not applicable here, or that there's additional structure.\n\nAlternatively, Quillen's theorem might require the ideal I to be such that the ring A is henselian. But Z/p^k is local, hence henselian. So why the discrepancy?\n\nLet's check K_2(Z/4). According to some sources, K_2(Z/4) is isomorphic to Z/2. This result comes from the work of Dennis and Stein. For example, K_2 of a ring of integers modulo m can be non-trivial even for m a prime power. Therefore, Quillen's theorem does not imply that K_n(Z/p^k) is isomorphic to K_n(F_p) for n \u22652. Therefore, my earlier reasoning was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute K_2(Z/27) directly. How is K_2 computed for such rings?\n\nDennis-Stein symbols are used to compute K_2 for commutative rings. For a ring R, K_2(R) is generated by Steinberg symbols {a, b} for a, b \u2208 R^*, subject to certain relations. For a local ring, like Z/27, every unit is a product of a unit in the residue field and a unit congruent to 1 modulo the maximal ideal. \n\nIn Z/27, the units are the numbers coprime to 3, so there are \u03c6(27)=18 units. The units modulo 3 form F_3^*, which has order 2. Thus, the units of Z/27 are generated by a primitive root modulo 27. Let's take 2 as a primitive root mod 3^3. The multiplicative order of 2 modulo 27 is \u03c6(27)=18, since 2^18 \u22611 mod 27. So the units are cyclic of order 18.\n\nNow, to compute K_2(Z/27), we need to consider the Steinberg symbols {a, b} where a, b are units. However, in a local ring with residue field of characteristic p, there might be some torsion in K_2 related to the prime p.\n\nAccording to a theorem by Dennis and Stein, for a local ring R with maximal ideal m and residue field k of characteristic p, K_2(R) has a certain decomposition. In particular, there is a map from the multiplicative group 1 + m to K_2(R) given by symbols {1 + a, 1 + b}, but I'm not sure of the exact structure.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that for a finite ring R, the group K_2(R) is also finite. For Z/p^k, K_2 can be computed as the kernel of the map K_2(Z/p^k) \u2192 K_2(F_p). But since K_2(F_p) is trivial, then K_2(Z/p^k) would be isomorphic to the kernel. However, this approach might not help.\n\nAlternatively, consult some known computations. For example, in \"K-theory of truncated polynomial rings\" by Hesselholt and others, but that's for polynomial rings. Alternatively, for Z/p^k, according to some references, K_2(Z/p^k) is isomorphic to the group of roots of unity of order dividing p^{k-1} in the ring. Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nWait, in the case of Z/9, Dennis and Stein computed K_2(Z/9) to be isomorphic to Z/3. Similarly, K_2(Z/p^k) is isomorphic to the additive group of the ring if p is odd. For p=3 and k=3 (Z/27), maybe K_2(Z/27) is isomorphic to Z/3^2=Z/9, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, consider the exact sequence from the paper by Keune: For Z/p^k, there's an exact sequence involving K_2. For example, K_2(Z/p^k) \u2192 K_2(Z/p^{k-1}) \u2192 ... but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that K_2(Z/9) is Z/3, and K_2(Z/3) is 0, maybe there's a pattern where K_2(Z/3^k) is Z/3^{k-1}. So for k=3, Z/9, but I need to verify.\n\nLooking for a specific reference, I recall that for odd primes p, K_2(Z/p^k) is cyclic of order p^{k-1}. This is a result by Dennis and Stein. For example, when p=3, then K_2(Z/3^k) is Z/3^{k-1}. Therefore, for Z/27, which is Z/3^3, K_2(Z/27) would be Z/9. Therefore, K_2 is non-zero, of order 9. Similarly, K_3(Z/27) would be isomorphic to K_3(F_3) = Z/8, and K_4(Z/27)=0.\n\nTherefore, if K_2(Z/27) is non-zero, then the largest natural number n where K_{2n}(Z/27) is non-zero is n=1, since K_2 is non-zero and K_4 is zero. Therefore, the answer would be n=1.\n\nThis conflicts with the previous reasoning using Quillen's theorem, but the key point is that Quillen's theorem may not apply in the way I thought. Dennis and Stein's calculations show that K_2(Z/p^k) can be non-zero even though K_2 of the residue field is zero, so the previous assumption that K_n(Z/p^k)\u2245K_n(F_p) for n\u22652 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is n=1, since K_2 is non-zero and K_4 is zero.\n</think>\n\nExplanation: The problem asks for the largest natural number \\( n \\) such that \\( K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\) is nonzero.

  "thinking": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. The question is asking for the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero. Hmm, I remember that K-groups, or algebraic K-theory groups, relate to things like projective modules over rings. But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the K-groups of finite cyclic groups like Z/mZ look like. I think for the ring Z/mZ, the algebraic K-theory groups K_n(Z/mZ) have some periodicity properties. Wait, Quillen computed some of these groups, right? Or maybe it's more related to the work of someone like Dennis or Stein?\n\nWait, there's a result that says for a ring A with an ideal I such that I is nilpotent, the K-groups of A and A/I are related via a long exact sequence. But Z/27 isn't a field; it's a ring with characteristic 27. Since 27 is 3^3, the ring Z/27 has a unique maximal ideal generated by 3. But does that help here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the K-groups of finite rings. Specifically, for Z/p^k where p is prime. There's a theorem in algebraic K-theory that relates the K-groups of such rings. For example, I remember that for the ring Z/p^k, the K-groups vanish above a certain degree. But up to what degree?\n\nWait, the question is about the (2n)th K-group being nonzero. So we need the highest n where K_{2n}(Z/27) isn't zero. The answer would then depend on the known vanishing ranges for K-theory of such rings.\n\nI recall that for a finite ring like Z/p^k, the K-groups are known to be finite abelian groups. Moreover, there's a result that says K_n(Z/p^k) is zero for sufficiently large n. Specifically, for rings with finite exponent, the K-theory groups eventually vanish. But the exact range where they vanish is key here.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the relationship between K-theory and topological cyclic homology (TC). Sometimes, the vanishing of K-groups can be inferred via TC methods, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, maybe this is connected to the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture, which relates K-theory to \u00e9tale cohomology. But that applies more to rings of integers in number fields. Not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, think about the K-theory of the integers modulo m. There's a paper by Hesselholt and Madsen which calculates the topological cyclic homology of Z/p^k, and from that, one can deduce the K-theory. In particular, for odd primes, they show that the K-groups of Z/p^k vanish in high degrees. Let me try to recall the exact statement.\n\nIn their work, Hesselholt and Madsen computed TC(Z/p^k), and from the cyclotomic trace map, K-theory can be approximated. For example, they showed that for Z/p^k, the K-groups K_i vanish for i \u2265 2p-2. Wait, p is 3 here since 27 is 3^3. So p=3, so 2p-2=4. So according to this, K_i(Z/27) would vanish for i \u22654. But wait, the question is about K_{2n} being nonzero. So if they vanish for i \u22654, then the highest even n where 2n < 4 would be n=1 (since 2n=2) and n=2 would be 4, but K_4 is zero. So the largest n would be 1? But that seems low. Wait, maybe this is incorrect.\n\nWait, another thought. The algebraic K-theory of Z/p^k for p odd is known to have K_{2i} isomorphic to (Z/p^{k})^m for some m, up to some degree. Wait, but maybe for Z/p^k, the even K-groups are cyclic groups? Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the K-theory of finite fields. Wait, but Z/27 isn't a field, it's a ring with nilpotent elements. The K-theory of finite fields is well-understood: K_{2i} of a finite field F_q is zero, and K_{2i-1} is cyclic of order q^i -1. But Z/27 isn't a field, so that doesn't directly apply.\n\nWait, but maybe for Z/p^k, there's a similar decomposition. For example, the K-groups of Z/p^k can be related to those of the residue field F_p. But since Z/p^k is a local ring with residue field F_p, there's a fiber sequence in K-theory. The localization sequence: K(F_p) \u2192 K(Z/p^k) \u2192 K(Z/p^k, (p)) \u2192 ... But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the work of Rognes and others on the K-theory of truncated polynomial algebras and similar rings. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that Z/p^k is a connective ring spectrum, but this is getting too abstract.\n\nWait, stepping back. The question is about the 2n-th K-group. For the ring Z/27, and n as large as possible such that K_{2n}(Z/27) is non-zero. The answer is likely small because K-groups of finite rings tend to vanish in higher degrees. For example, for the field F_p, the even K-groups are zero, but here we have a ring with characteristic p^k, not a field.\n\nWait, perhaps if I look at specific computations. For example, K_0(Z/27) is the Grothendieck group of finitely generated projective modules. Since Z/27 is local (as it's a finite local ring), every projective module is free, so K_0(Z/27) is Z, but in reality, for a local ring, K_0 is always Z, generated by the free module of rank 1. But in this case, since the ring is finite, maybe K_0 is actually cyclic? Wait, no. For a local ring, K_0 is indeed Z, because the only projective modules are free of finite rank, and the Grothendieck group is generated by [R], so it's isomorphic to Z. But I think in some cases, when the ring is finite, perhaps there's some torsion. Wait, no, K_0 doesn't see torsion. For example, even if the ring is finite, the K_0 group is still Z. Because projective modules over local rings are free, so the Grothendieck group is generated by the free modules, hence Z. So K_0(Z/27) is Z. But the question is about higher K-groups.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the (2n)th K-group of Z/27\". If K_0 is Z, then K_0 is nonzero, but that's the 0th group, which is even. But the question is about the largest n such that K_{2n} is nonzero. So starting from n=0, K_0 is Z, so that's nonzero. Then K_2, K_4, etc. But for finite rings, higher K-groups tend to be torsion. Maybe K_2(Z/27) is nonzero, but K_4(Z/27) is zero? Then the answer would be n=1 (since 2n=2). But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the higher even K-groups are related to the multiplicative groups. Wait, K_1 of a ring is the group of units. So K_1(Z/27) is the units of Z/27, which is multiplicative group of integers mod 27. That has order \u03c6(27)=18. So K_1 is a finite abelian group of order 18. So K_1 is nonzero. K_2 of a ring is related to Milnor K-theory or Steinberg symbols. For a finite ring, K_2(Z/27) might be non-zero. Let me check.\n\nBut actually, for local rings, there are some computations. For example, for Z/p^k, K_2 can be computed. There's a formula for K_2 of truncated polynomial rings. Wait, but Z/p^k isn't a truncated polynomial ring. Wait, Z/p^k is a principal ideal ring, and it's local with maximal ideal (p). So maybe apply some known formula.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about known results. For example, in \"Algebraic K-theory\" by Srinivas, there's a mention that for a ring A with an ideal I such that I is nilpotent, K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is surjective for n=1 and an isomorphism for n \u22652. Wait, but that's when A is a radical ideal. Wait, if A is a ring with an ideal I such that I is contained in the Jacobson radical, and A/I has K_n(A/I) \u2192 K_{n-1}(I) is part of a long exact sequence. Maybe this is the local case.\n\nBut given that Z/27 is a local ring with residue field F_3. Then we can consider the reduction map Z/27 \u2192 F_3, which has kernel the ideal (3). Since (3) is a nilpotent ideal (as 3^3=0 in Z/27). Then there is a long exact sequence relating K-groups of Z/27, F_3, and the ideal (3). However, the ideal (3) is isomorphic as a ring without unit to ... Hmm, maybe this isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that for a nilpotent extension, the K-theory in positive degrees is an isomorphism. Wait, but I thought that Quillen's theorem says that if I is a nilpotent ideal, then K_n(A,I) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism. But I might be mixing up the statements. Wait, in general, for a surjective ring homomorphism with kernel I, if I is nilpotent, then the relative K-groups K_n(A,I) vanish, so the map K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism. Is that true? If so, then K_n(Z/27) would be isomorphic to K_n(F_3) for all n \u22651. But F_3 is a finite field, so K_n(F_3) is known. For finite fields, K_{2i} is zero and K_{2i-1} is cyclic of order q^i -1. So K_1(F_3) is F_3^*, which is cyclic of order 2. K_2(F_3) is zero. K_3(F_3) is cyclic of order 8 (since 3^2 -1=8). Then K_4(F_3) is zero, K_5(F_3) is cyclic of order 80 (3^3 -1=26? Wait, no, wait. For finite field F_q, K_{2i-1}(F_q) is cyclic of order q^i -1. So for F_3: K_1 is order 2 (3^1 -1=2). K_3 is order 3^2 -1=8. K_5 is 3^3 -1=26, which is 26. So if the K-theory of Z/27 is isomorphic to that of F_3 in positive degrees, then K_n(Z/27) for n\u22651 would be same as K_n(F_3). Then since K_{2i}(F_3)=0 for all i\u22651, so K_2, K_4, etc., of Z/27 would be zero. But K_0(Z/27) is Z, but that's the only even one. Therefore, in this case, the answer would be n=0. But the question says \"natural number n\", so n=0 is allowed? But the problem says \"natural number\", which sometimes is considered to start at 1. Wait, but the problem statement says \"natural number n\", which could be 0 or 1 depending on convention.\n\nWait, wait. If the reduction map Z/27 \u2192 F_3 induces isomorphisms on K_n for n \u22651, then K_{2n}(Z/27) would be zero for all n \u22651. So the only even K-group that's non-zero is K_0. So the largest n would be 0. But the question is about the largest natural number n. If natural numbers here are defined as positive integers (1,2,3,...), then there is no such n, but K_0 is non-zero. Hmm, but maybe in the problem's context, natural numbers include zero. But this is unclear.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the (2n)th K-group\". If n is a natural number here starting at 1, then 2n starts at 2. But if n=0 is allowed, then 0th K-group is K_0. But the problem might be expecting n to be at least 1, but that's unclear.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, if the K-groups of Z/27 for n \u22651 are the same as those of F_3, which have even K-groups zero, then the answer would be n=0. But the answer is supposed to be a natural number. If the problem assumes natural numbers start at 1, then there are no even K-groups nonzero beyond K_0, so the answer would be no solution. But that can't be. Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the result by Hesselholt and Madsen, they might have said that K_i(Z/p^k) vanishes for i \u2265 2p-2. For p=3, that's i \u22654. So K_4 and above vanish. Then K_2 and K_3 would be non-zero? Wait, but earlier reasoning via the Quillen's result says K_n(Z/27) is isomorphic to K_n(F_3) for n \u22651. So in that case, K_2 would be zero. Hmm, conflicting information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the result about nilpotent ideals applies only when the ideal is in the radical, but even so, in this case, (3) is in the Jacobson radical of Z/27. So perhaps Quillen's theorem does apply here, making K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3) for all n \u22651. Then as K_2(F_3)=0, K_4(F_3)=0, etc., the only non-zero even K-group would be K_0. So the answer would be n=0. But the problem says \"natural number\", which usually starts from 1. But maybe the problem allows n=0. Let me check the exact question again.\n\nThe question is: \"What is the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero?\" So if n is allowed to be 0, then 2n=0, and K_0 is nonzero. If natural numbers start at 1, then the answer is no solution. But since the problem is asking for a natural number, and K-groups in even degrees beyond 0 are zero, then the answer should be n=0, but only if 0 is considered a natural number here. However, in many mathematical contexts, natural numbers start at 1, but sometimes include 0. This is ambiguous. But given that K_0 is nonzero, and if the problem allows n=0, then that's the answer. Otherwise, if n must be positive, then there is no such n, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption that K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3) for n \u22651 is incorrect. Maybe there's a higher K-group that doesn't vanish. For example, maybe K_2(Z/27) is non-zero. Let's look for references. \n\nLooking up, I recall that for the ring R = Z/p^k, the K-groups K_n(R) for n \u22652 are isomorphic to K_n(R, (p)), the relative K-groups. But in the case where the ideal (p) is nilpotent, the relative K-theory might be related to the cyclic homology or something else. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. The K-theory of Z/p^k can be computed using the framework of topological cyclic homology (TC) via the cyclotomic trace. According to Hesselholt and Madsen's work, for odd primes p, the K-groups of Z/p^k vanish above degree 2p-2. For p=3, 2p-2=4. So K_i(Z/27) =0 for i \u22654. Therefore, the possible non-zero K-groups are up to degree 3.\n\nBut wait, if p=3, then 2p-2=4, so K_4 and higher vanish. Therefore, K_0, K_1, K_2, K_3 could be non-zero. Now, for K_0 we know it's Z. For K_1, it's the units, which is Z/18. For K_2, perhaps it's non-zero. If Hesselholt and Madsen's calculation says that K_2(Z/27) is non-zero, then maybe the answer is n=1 (since 2n=2). Then K_2 is non-zero, K_4 is zero. So the largest n would be 1.\n\nBut how do we know if K_2(Z/27) is non-zero? Let's think. If the Quillen's result that K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3) for n \u22651 is correct, then K_2(Z/27) would be zero, as K_2(F_3)=0. But maybe this is only true for n \u22652? Or maybe the result requires the ideal to be not just nilpotent but something else. \n\nAlternatively, there's a result called the \"fundamental theorem of K-theory\" which gives a long exact sequence for K-groups of a ring with an ideal. For the ideal (3) in Z/27, which is nilpotent (since 3^3=0), the long exact sequence would be ... \u2192 K_n(3Z/27) \u2192 K_n(Z/27) \u2192 K_n(F_3) \u2192 K_{n-1}(3Z/27) \u2192 ... But 3Z/27 is a module over Z/27, but I'm not sure how to compute its K-groups. However, since (3) is a nilpotent ideal, maybe the K-groups of Z/27 and F_3 are related. \n\nWait, according to Quillen's d\u00e9vissage theorem, which applies to abelian categories, if you have a nilpotent extension, the K-theory of the two rings are the same. Specifically, if I is a nilpotent ideal in a ring A, then the category of finitely generated projective A-modules is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective A/I-modules. Wait, but this only affects K_0. For higher K-groups, there's a theorem that says that if I is a nilpotent ideal, then K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism for all n \u22650. Wait, is that true? If so, then for Z/27, since (3) is a nilpotent ideal, then K_n(Z/27) \u2192 K_n(F_3) is an isomorphism for all n \u22650. But K_0(F_3)=Z, which matches K_0(Z/27)=Z. K_1(F_3)=F_3^*=Z/2, but K_1(Z/27)= (Z/27)^* which is Z/18. That contradicts the previous statement. So clearly, the theorem I'm recalling must have some other conditions. \n\nAh, perhaps the theorem requires that the ideal I is in the radical of A. In this case, (3) is indeed in the Jacobson radical of Z/27, since Z/27 is local. Then, according to the theorem, the map K_n(Z/27) \u2192 K_n(F_3) is an isomorphism for n \u22651. But K_1(Z/27) is (Z/27)^*, which is Z/18, and K_1(F_3) is Z/2. These aren't isomorphic. So that contradicts the idea that the map is an isomorphism. Therefore, my previous reasoning is flawed.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to revisit the exact statement of the theorem. Perhaps it's not an isomorphism, but a surjection for n=1 and isomorphism for n \u22652. For example, Theorem 5.1 in Chapter III of Weibel's K-book: If I is a nilpotent ideal in a ring A, then for each n \u22651, K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is surjective, and it is an isomorphism for n \u22652 if A is commutative. Wait, is that the case?\n\nAccording to Weibel's \"K-book\", Corollary 1.5 in Chapter III states that if I is a nilpotent ideal in a ring A, then K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is surjective for n=1 and an isomorphism for all n \u22652. Therefore, in our case, since (3) is a nilpotent ideal in Z/27, then for n \u22652, K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3). But for n=1, the map is surjective. So K_1(Z/27) \u2192 K_1(F_3) is surjective, so there's a short exact sequence:\n\n0 \u2192 K_1(Z/27, I) \u2192 K_1(Z/27) \u2192 K_1(F_3) \u2192 0.\n\nBut K_1(Z/27, I) is the relative K_1 group. In the case of a surjective map with kernel I, the relative K_1 group K_1(A,I) is isomorphic to 1 + I. Since I = (3) in Z/27, which is 3Z/27Z. Then 1 + I is the subgroup of the multiplicative group (Z/27)^* consisting of elements congruent to 1 mod 3. Let's see: (Z/27)^* has \u03c6(27)=18 elements. The elements congruent to 1 mod 3 form a subgroup. Let's compute:\n\nElements in Z/27 that are congruent to 1 mod 3 are numbers of the form 1 + 3k mod 27, where k=0,...,8. So there are 9 elements. Thus, 1 + I has order 9. Therefore, K_1(Z/27, I) is isomorphic to this multiplicative subgroup, which is cyclic if 9 is prime power. Since 9 is 3^2, and the multiplicative group of 1 + I in this case is isomorphic to Z/9. Because in Z/27, the multiplicative group 1 + 3Z/27 is isomorphic to Z/9. Let me check:\n\nTake 1 + 3 mod 27. Let's compute its order. (1 + 3)^n \u2261 1 + 3n mod 9. Wait, but we're working modulo 27. Let's compute (1 + 3)^3 = 1 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 9 + 27 + 27. Wait, but in modulo 27, 27 is 0. So (1 + 3)^3 \u2261 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10 mod 27. Continuing, (1 + 3)^9. Wait, this might not be cyclic. Alternatively, using the logarithm map for the multiplicative group. The multiplicative group of Z/27 is cyclic of order 18. The subgroup 1 + 3Z/27 has order 9, which is a cyclic subgroup of order 9. Therefore, K_1(Z/27, I) \u2245 Z/9. Therefore, the exact sequence:\n\n0 \u2192 Z/9 \u2192 K_1(Z/27) \u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0.\n\nBut K_1(Z/27) is the units group of Z/27, which is Z/18. So the exact sequence must split, giving Z/18 \u2245 Z/9 \u00d7 Z/2. But since 9 and 2 are coprime, Z/18 is cyclic, so this can't split as a direct product. Wait, so there's a contradiction. This suggests that my understanding is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relative K_1 group is not 1 + I. Let me recall that K_1(A,I) is defined as GL(A,I)/E(A,I), where GL(A,I) is the kernel of GL(A) \u2192 GL(A/I), and E(A,I) is the subgroup generated by elementary matrices. But for a commutative local ring like Z/27, I think that K_1(A,I) is indeed 1 + I, which in this case is isomorphic to the additive group of I. Wait, but I is an additive group isomorphic to Z/9, and 1 + I is multiplicatively a subgroup. Let's compute 1 + 3Z/27Z.\n\nThe elements are 1, 1+3=4, 1+6=7, 1+9=10, 1+12=13, 1+15=16, 1+18=19, 1+21=22, 1+24=25 mod 27. So these are the elements congruent to 1 mod 3. The multiplicative order of 4 mod 27. Let's compute powers:\n\n4^1 =4\n\n4^2 =16\n\n4^3 =64 \u2261 10\n\n4^4 =40 \u226113\n\n4^5=52\u226125\n\n4^6=100\u226119\n\n4^7=76\u226122\n\n4^8=88\u22617\n\n4^9=28\u22611 mod27. So the multiplicative order of 4 mod 27 is 9. Therefore, the subgroup 1 + I is cyclic of order 9, generated by 4. Therefore, it's Z/9. \n\nTherefore, the exact sequence is 0 \u2192 Z/9 \u2192 Z/18 \u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0. But Z/18 is cyclic, and this sequence can't split as a direct sum because Z/9 \u00d7 Z/2 is not cyclic. So there must be a non-split extension. However, in reality, Z/18 is cyclic, so the exact sequence here is actually:\n\n0 \u2192 Z/9 \u2192 Z/18 \u2192 Z/2 \u2192 0\n\nWhich corresponds to the subgroup Z/9 of Z/18. But since Z/18 is cyclic, every subgroup of order 9 is cyclic, and the quotient is Z/2. So this sequence is valid, but K_1(Z/27) is cyclic of order 18. So the map from Z/9 to Z/18 is injective, and the quotient is Z/2. But this suggests that the relative K_1 group is Z/9, K_1(Z/27) is Z/18, and K_1(F_3) is Z/2. So the exact sequence holds.\n\nBut according to Quillen's theorem, for n \u22652, K_n(Z/27) \u2245 K_n(F_3). So for n=2, K_2(Z/27) \u2245 K_2(F_3). But K_2(F_3) is zero. Therefore, K_2(Z/27)=0. Similarly, K_3(Z/27) \u2245 K_3(F_3). K_3(F_3) is isomorphic to Z/8, according to Quillen's computation. For finite fields, K_{2i-1}(F_q) is Z/(q^i -1). So K_3(F_3)=Z/(3^2 -1)=Z/8. So K_3(Z/27) \u2245 Z/8. Then K_4(Z/27) \u2245 K_4(F_3)=0, and so on. Therefore, the even K-groups of Z/27 beyond K_0 are zero. Hence, the largest n where K_{2n}(Z/27) is nonzero is n=0. But if the problem considers natural numbers starting from 1, then there is no such n, which can't be. Hence, the answer is n=0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the question is phrased as \"the largest natural number n\". If n must be a positive integer, then there is no such n, but since K_0 is Z, which is nonzero, and n=0 would give K_0. But the problem says \"natural number\", which in mathematics sometimes includes zero and sometimes doesn't. However, in many contexts, especially in algebraic K-theory, the numbering starts at n=0,1,2, etc. So if the problem allows n=0, then the answer is 0, otherwise, it's impossible. But the problem likely expects n=0 as the answer.\n\nBut I need to verify the original question again. The problem says \"the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero\". If n is a natural number, and if natural numbers include 0, then yes, n=0. However, in some contexts, natural numbers start at 1. This is a bit ambiguous. However, given that K_0 is always considered in K-theory, and the problem mentions \"natural number\", it's possible that the answer is n=0. Alternatively, the problem might have a different intended approach.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming Quillen's theorem applies here. Because Quillen's theorem says that for a nilpotent ideal I in a ring A, K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism for n \u22652 and surjective for n=1. So K_2(Z/27) \u2245 K_2(F_3). But K_2 of a field is Milnor K-theory, which for F_3 is zero. So K_2(F_3)=0. Hence, K_2(Z/27)=0. Similarly, K_4(Z/27)=0. So the only even K-group that is non-zero is K_0. Therefore, the answer must be n=0. But since the problem asks for natural number n, which may or may not include zero. If the answer is supposed to be 0, then put 0. But sometimes in problems, especially if they ask for \"natural number\", they might expect n \u22651.\n\nWait, but considering that the K-groups in even positive degrees are zero, the answer might be n=0. However, in some references, the K-groups of Z/p^k are known to have K_2 non-zero. For example, according to some papers, K_2(Z/9) is cyclic of order 3. If that's the case, then for Z/9, K_2 is non-zero, so for Z/27, maybe K_2 is non-zero. Then the answer would be n=1. But this contradicts the earlier application of Quillen's theorem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming Quillen's theorem applies here. Let's check the specific case of Z/p^k. If I is the ideal (p), then the quotient is F_p. But for K-theory, the result that K_n(A) \u2192 K_n(A/I) is an isomorphism for n \u22652 holds for any ring A with a nilpotent ideal I. So for Z/p^k, this would imply K_n(Z/p^k) \u2245 K_n(F_p) for n \u22652. But does this hold?\n\nBut wait, for example, K_2(Z/4) is known to be isomorphic to Z/2, which is non-zero, while K_2(F_2) is zero. So this contradicts the theorem. Therefore, my previous reasoning must be flawed. Therefore, Quillen's theorem must not apply in this case. But why?\n\nAh, maybe Quillen's theorem requires the ideal to be in the radical and the ring to be commutative. But in this case, Z/p^k is commutative, and the ideal (p) is indeed in the radical. So why does K_2(Z/4) not vanish? Maybe because K_2(Z/4) is non-zero. This suggests that the theorem is not applicable here, or that there's additional structure.\n\nAlternatively, Quillen's theorem might require the ideal I to be such that the ring A is henselian. But Z/p^k is local, hence henselian. So why the discrepancy?\n\nLet's check K_2(Z/4). According to some sources, K_2(Z/4) is isomorphic to Z/2. This result comes from the work of Dennis and Stein. For example, K_2 of a ring of integers modulo m can be non-trivial even for m a prime power. Therefore, Quillen's theorem does not imply that K_n(Z/p^k) is isomorphic to K_n(F_p) for n \u22652. Therefore, my earlier reasoning was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute K_2(Z/27) directly. How is K_2 computed for such rings?\n\nDennis-Stein symbols are used to compute K_2 for commutative rings. For a ring R, K_2(R) is generated by Steinberg symbols {a, b} for a, b \u2208 R^*, subject to certain relations. For a local ring, like Z/27, every unit is a product of a unit in the residue field and a unit congruent to 1 modulo the maximal ideal. \n\nIn Z/27, the units are the numbers coprime to 3, so there are \u03c6(27)=18 units. The units modulo 3 form F_3^*, which has order 2. Thus, the units of Z/27 are generated by a primitive root modulo 27. Let's take 2 as a primitive root mod 3^3. The multiplicative order of 2 modulo 27 is \u03c6(27)=18, since 2^18 \u22611 mod 27. So the units are cyclic of order 18.\n\nNow, to compute K_2(Z/27), we need to consider the Steinberg symbols {a, b} where a, b are units. However, in a local ring with residue field of characteristic p, there might be some torsion in K_2 related to the prime p.\n\nAccording to a theorem by Dennis and Stein, for a local ring R with maximal ideal m and residue field k of characteristic p, K_2(R) has a certain decomposition. In particular, there is a map from the multiplicative group 1 + m to K_2(R) given by symbols {1 + a, 1 + b}, but I'm not sure of the exact structure.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that for a finite ring R, the group K_2(R) is also finite. For Z/p^k, K_2 can be computed as the kernel of the map K_2(Z/p^k) \u2192 K_2(F_p). But since K_2(F_p) is trivial, then K_2(Z/p^k) would be isomorphic to the kernel. However, this approach might not help.\n\nAlternatively, consult some known computations. For example, in \"K-theory of truncated polynomial rings\" by Hesselholt and others, but that's for polynomial rings. Alternatively, for Z/p^k, according to some references, K_2(Z/p^k) is isomorphic to the group of roots of unity of order dividing p^{k-1} in the ring. Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nWait, in the case of Z/9, Dennis and Stein computed K_2(Z/9) to be isomorphic to Z/3. Similarly, K_2(Z/p^k) is isomorphic to the additive group of the ring if p is odd. For p=3 and k=3 (Z/27), maybe K_2(Z/27) is isomorphic to Z/3^2=Z/9, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, consider the exact sequence from the paper by Keune: For Z/p^k, there's an exact sequence involving K_2. For example, K_2(Z/p^k) \u2192 K_2(Z/p^{k-1}) \u2192 ... but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that K_2(Z/9) is Z/3, and K_2(Z/3) is 0, maybe there's a pattern where K_2(Z/3^k) is Z/3^{k-1}. So for k=3, Z/9, but I need to verify.\n\nLooking for a specific reference, I recall that for odd primes p, K_2(Z/p^k) is cyclic of order p^{k-1}. This is a result by Dennis and Stein. For example, when p=3, then K_2(Z/3^k) is Z/3^{k-1}. Therefore, for Z/27, which is Z/3^3, K_2(Z/27) would be Z/9. Therefore, K_2 is non-zero, of order 9. Similarly, K_3(Z/27) would be isomorphic to K_3(F_3) = Z/8, and K_4(Z/27)=0.\n\nTherefore, if K_2(Z/27) is non-zero, then the largest natural number n where K_{2n}(Z/27) is non-zero is n=1, since K_2 is non-zero and K_4 is zero. Therefore, the answer would be n=1.\n\nThis conflicts with the previous reasoning using Quillen's theorem, but the key point is that Quillen's theorem may not apply in the way I thought. Dennis and Stein's calculations show that K_2(Z/p^k) can be non-zero even though K_2 of the residue field is zero, so the previous assumption that K_n(Z/p^k)\u2245K_n(F_p) for n\u22652 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is n=1, since K_2 is non-zero and K_4 is zero.",
